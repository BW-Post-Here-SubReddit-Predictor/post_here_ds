ekz9fq|2020-01-06 19:53:30|Looking for help in zone 8b/9a...|"**TLDR:** I want plants (a little bit of everything) for zone 8b/9a that smell good, will grow in sandy/loam/clay, and feed the local pollinators year round. Flexible on light. Have a lot of space to work with.

Sorry this is so long. My fiancé and I have recently cleaned up a lot of space on the property and are in the process of cleaning up more. We’re going to end up planting a LOT of stuff out here, and I need some help figuring out what to put out here. We want to put in a little bit of everything—some understory trees, some shrubs, herbs, ground cover, the whole nine. I’m definitely going to be putting in native plants, but I really want stuff that is going to smell good and feed the local pollinators year round. 

We’re in zone 8b, but I’ve seen plants that are meant for zone 9a/9b thriving just ten miles from my house, so I’m sure I’m flexible on that. Summers are anywhere between 97-110F with anywhere between 40-80% humidity depending on the time of day. Winters don’t typically get below freezing for more than a few nights in a row. I think this winter we got into the high 20s for about four or five days in the middle of the night.

The soil out here is sandy/loam/clay (not red clay). There are a LOT of pine trees and oak trees and a bit of prickly pear cactus spread around the property if that helps. We’re flexible on light too. There are some areas that are going to get a lot of sun, and some that will only get dappled light. 

The bees and butterflies around here went nuts over the [native bee balm](https://images.app.goo.gl/WdD9XvAGRmrjtUdS6) and the [variegated stuff](https://images.app.goo.gl/sA7wLWMhE8X9dSDKA) I bought from the nursery last year. Quite literally sucking the stuff dry. They didn’t touch the [butterfly bush](https://images.app.goo.gl/GdCbVyTsLsh5rrMT9) at all, but did spend some time on the [butterfly weed](https://images.app.goo.gl/PCq4ywTDy6KYaKaq7) and [fall asters](https://images.app.goo.gl/2ZUnL9wqxNYDsXHT9) I planted. I would loooooooove to have an established gardenia shrub, but I haven’t had much luck so far. 

Again, I really want stuff that smells good and feeds the local pollinators. I’m open to any and all suggestions with the exception of vines. THANKS IN ADVANCE! :)"|MBarbarian|False|https://redd.it/ekz9fq|2|0.75|0|2|1|gardening

So, on to the plant. My wife and I put it in a pot last week and it has been sitting on our mantle which is the spot with the most natural lighting in our place. I noticed that the side facing away from the window was wilting, so we put it on the back porch for more light. A few days passed and it was still wilting (although at a slower rate than it was inside). So this morning I put it on my front porch in direct sunlight for one hour. I went outside to check on it and the whole thing had wilted significantly more within that hour. I'm not really sure what to do... We watered it maybe 5 days ago... so maybe it needs water? also, maybe there's too little light on the back porch and mantle, and too much light on the front porch?

ektbyl|2020-01-06 12:10:37|A couple of basic questions for a beginner|"I bought a new home and planted some drought tolerant plants about 6 months ago.  I live in the desert, it's hot and very dry.  I bought a number of plants online at a plant clearance website and had it delivered.  Worst decision ever.

All their plants look like they were on the verge of dying and had the minimum amount of soil necessary, sometimes even the top portion of the roots were exposed.

1.  I bought a number of bougainvilleas.  They all had minimal flowers when delivered and the branches felt very stiff all over.  In the heat of summer if I missed watering every few days then the flowers fell off immediately.  They have since grown back some, but it doesn't seem like the plant is growing taller.  Any tips?  
2. I also bought a number of Japanese boxwood.  Except for one which died, they all seem to be surviving well, but I am not sure they are growing much.  I pulled out the dead one and after 6 months it's root ball did not expand at all. 
3. I didn't tease any of the root balls before planting.  I also bought a giant bird of paradise, as well as some drought resistant shrubs.  They seem to be doing so so, but also I don't see much growth.  How to remedy this?  Dig each one up, tease, and replant?

My soil is sandy loam.  In fact, some areas are so hard and compacted they are like rocks.  To dig a hole I had to use a pickaxe.  Before digging I scattered gypsum to break up the soil.  I dug a deep and wide enough hole for the plants and mixed half and half with compost.  The area surrounding each plant is still soft and did not harden up, but I didn't do a pH analysis or anything like that."|delorisdeloris|False|https://redd.it/ektbyl|2|1.0|0|6|1|gardening

ekqau4|2020-01-06 06:48:19|Help me bring life to my backyard|"Hey r/gardening, I'm new here, in 9B (Florida) and in desperate need of some life in my backyard. My wife has recently found a love for plants so I gave her 6 months to prove it wasn't a temporary thing and well it's not, she's treating plants like they're her babies. 

Anyways long story short we've had a rough end of this year, December is always crappy for us (lots of friend and family deaths) and we ended it with a miscarriage. 

I want to do something for my wife that will bring us happiness, daily (other than our kids and dogs). I want to make our backyard our own little escape, but right now it's like a poop minefield barren waste land. Our grass struggles to grow as is with this areas heat and humidity for 10 months out of the year, then as you can see my dogs literally create tracks from their playing and digging. 

I dont have a green thumb, I honestly dont even know what I'm doing but I'm open to suggestions and advice, I'm willing to learn. What can/should I do with this blank (but poopy) slate of a yard?

ekuwqb|2020-01-06 14:35:34|Big beef and costoluto type tomato issues|"Hello all!

I have been planting several different types of tomatoes over the years and there’s a type of tomato I just can’t manage to get right, it’s the really large ones with a bunch of folds. They always scar and have these really large brown scabby areas on them. 
No problem with end rot or any other diseases. I don’t have any pests either. 
They’re perfectly edible and delicious it’s just that they’re a pain in the bum to peel and prep and I lose so much time and also actual tomato flesh in the process. 

Is this a deficiency? Is this a soil pH problem? Has anyone had this issue and figured out what the problem was?

Thanks a lot for reading!!

They are also trees with more exposed roots so no longer need to mow... but will be planting shrubs and other shade plants under both (at least I hope it works!) so need a new leaf solution.

I was thinking adding 2 compost bins on these same 2 sides of the yard. But even with 2 they'd need to be large. It's a lot of leaves to blow and subsequently rake and compact. The ones to buy or DIY I see seem far too small.

How do I determine the right size? I'll likely still create a smaller 1-2 to transition into (like the 3 bin systems) but the first bin needs to be large.

I have tried everything from repotting all of the plants to drying them out, soaking the top layer of soil in neem oil, covering the top layer of the plants with mosquito dunks and sand, and finally diatomaceous earth. Although all of those treatments seem to have been fairly effective, I still have a few of these assholes flying around......and when I see one I know that the potential for hundreds is right around the corner. 
 
When I have gone into local garden shops to ask what the next step is they advise I just throw out all of my plants. Unfortunately, like some folks here, I am fairly attached to most of them and the few have been with me for years. I’d love for this to be avoided, if possible.

Got a potted Meyer lemon tree from Lowe's around 6 months ago. I repotted into a 12""-15"" wide pot or so. It was left outside for a while but it seemed to be taking on a lot of wind damage and it's winter now (Texas to be fair) so I moved it inside into the place where it can get the most light. I know they require full sun, so I also recently got a grow light for it that I run for 6 hours from 5 pm to 11 pm.

Since I moved it inside a month ago and started the grow light, I noticed it had A LOT of blossoms all over the place. However, it seems almost allof the blooms have dropped and a lot of the leaves are turning yellow/brown and subsequently falling as well. Is this stress? I have been fertilizing with Jobe's citrus fertilizer occasionally and also have tried a liquid fertilizer recently that seems balanced. It doesn't seem like it has helped at all. The temperature in my home is 70F.

In addition, there are some lush green leaves that are curled up. There are 5 lemons (3 of which appear to be full sized and yellow) which all started growing prior to the move inside about a month ago. Several of the other leaves have some small amounts of yellow near the tips.

I previously saw insects/white webbing on the tree and sprayed with neem several times and don't see any now although I do see some insects in the soil.

I am beyond confused as to what this lemon tree needs. I thought I was overwatering it at first. I water maybe 1 cup or so every 3-4 days or so. I stick my finger 2 or 3 inches deep into the soil before each watering and note that it seems fairly dry when I'm watering. Then my next suspicion was nitrogen deficiency but I figure I should have repleted enough nitrogen by now. So what is this, overwatering, underwatering, nutrient deficiency??? Apparently I have been watering incorrectly it seems as I never watered enough to let it drain all the way out the bottom hole of the pot.

ekfaat|2020-01-05 16:38:05|Possibly dumb question about pruning tomatoes and vining plants. (St. Louis, MO USA. Zone 6b)|"I've always been more of a -throw it at the ground and see what happens- kind of gardener.  But last year I was encouraged by the number of tomatoes we were able to grow with more effort.  This season I'm putting more into planning for my small space.

So, squash, cucumbers, and the like...I was planning to train these plants up arbors, fences, dead trees, etc.  If I cut the vines back once they've filled their space, will they keep producing?  Or do they really need the massive splay of leaves that you see when a pumpkin takes over your yard.  I could see it going either way.  Maybe they'd produce more when kept small because they aren't putting energy into creating more vegetation. Or maybe they can't fruit without the energy from all those leaves.  I'd love to know if aggressive pruning of vines will still give me a productive crop.

Tomatoes.  I always end up with a real jungle of indeterminate that seem to weave themselves into a 4 foot high solid mound.  This obviously leads to a lot of daily hunting and lost fruits that go to waste.  I was going to try to incorporate some determinate varities into the mix this year.  But for the indeterminates that we love, would aggressive pruning and staking work for them?  We managed to grow enough tomatoes for our family for a year this summer.  If repeating that means that we're stuck with the mound, then so be it.  But I'd love to make room for some other crops if possible.

&#x200B;

Thanks for your patience and help!

However, I've recently read that it might be better to have a raised bed without a bottom or a standard garden for the health of the garden. I'm in 8b...great soil in Oregon, lots of rain in fall/winter/early spring.

I have a beautiful lemon tree, but lately it’s been showing signs of something going wrong. The leaves are developing black spots, and over the last couple weeks it has shed a lot of lower, older leaves. A few days ago I fertilized for the first time with a liquid citrus fertilizer. The next day saw the spots. I thought it was over watered so I tilled the soil to dry it out and exchanged 50 percent new soil inside the pot and took out some wet and older soil.

Someone recommended I spray anti fungal spray over the entire tree...and it has been 24hrs. Some of the new leaves are starting to curl. Any tips or suggestions would be very helpful! I don’t want to lose my lemon tree!

ek2m3q|2020-01-04 21:15:21|My Poor Lantana|"Ok, So here is my poor potted lantana. I am in zone 6a, Northern Indiana. This was my first year living anywhere where there is actual seasons, which also means gardening where there are actual seasons (I used to live in South Florida, Zone 10b). I love lantanas and I really wanted to have one potted so that I could overwinter it inside and not have to start it over every year. That worked out really well and my guy grew to a nice size over the last season.

My issues started happening was when the seasons started to change and I think I brought him into my sunroom at a good time, but I underestimated how cold my sunroom would get. I planned on making an overwintering area in my basement with lights and all that jazz, but the project just kept getting pushed back and so my guy sat in the sunroom even longer. I eventually just brought him inside and put him by a window. He was (is) mighty crispy, but I was hoping he would bounce back after warming back up. I watered him and left him to do his thing.

I did notice he was sucking up water, so I knew he was alive in there. Lo and behold, I just noticed the other day that he has sprouted some new growth at his base (the green bits at the bottom of the pic. [Here](https://imgur.com/QYD4lPr) is a closer pic of the new growth)

My question is this: Should I prune him down to he base where the new growth is at? Or will he start coming back higher up as time goes on? Basically, to prune, or not too prune is the question.

ejy8vd|2020-01-04 15:54:30|A question on propagation|"Hello r/gardening. I'm somewhat new to the gardening scene but I got into it as a way to learn about investing physically because I'm a kinesthetic learner but don't have the money to do so.

My question is about propagating mostly hardwoods but some semi hardwoods, too. Last year, I tried propagating numerous fruit plants. They were grapes, ribes (currants and gooseberries), blueberries, and raspberries. I had never done it before but I was told that if you put it in soil and bring it inside your home just as the temperature is warming up, it should work. I had four big pots, 2 of which I put the grapes in and 2 of which the rest went in. I had been doing research in the winter and I had expected the grapes to take a while to come out of dormancy. I guess its because grapes are late-season. Currants and gooseberries, however, are early-bloomers (I confirmed that last year) so they should be the first to grow I thought.

When I saw leaves on the currants and gooseberries two weeks later, I was ecstatic. My mom had always bought more roses and I only found out about propagation in 2018 so I thought if I could do it with the plants I like, it could possibly work for her. I brought it outside and monitored it for about another month. Around this time, most of the raspberries also developed leaves. Unfortunately, all of the currants started to wilt and/or start to produce flowers which I later found out would've turned into fruit. The raspberries and blueberries also started to die off. Only two gooseberries survived right up until this winter. When it comes to grapes, I had about 30-35 cuttings and 20 survived. I learned my lesson the hard way last year when I brought in plants from a nursery I got for a discount inside my house instead of planting it in the ground because I thought they would survive but unfortunately they all died so I put them (both grapes and gooseberries) all in the ground this year.

I've been looking for answers ever since my currants died and I've come to this hypothesis: the the currants, raspberries, gooseberries, and blueberries mostly died because most of their energy went into making leaves. It takes a minimum of one month before these plants root and even then it is possible for a plant to die. My mistake was bringing them inside; I could've kept the pots outside where they would've warmed up gradually instead of instantly although I don't know how that would make them more likely to produce roots. It is possible to grow currants and gooseberries in water and transplant them into soil once the roots are long enough. Having plants in pots in your house is a gamble and its better to put them in the ground and remove them in the following spring.

I guess why I made this post is because I want to propagate properly. I've made mistakes and I'm planning on correcting them this year but there could be some things that I don't know that could help me. Any suggestions?

I am confused by some of the advice I've seen online about growing it.  It seems to be good outside either from Zone 6 or 7 and warmer (I am in 7a), which tells me that it is tolerant to some cold. However, several references state the importance of keeping it out of drafts if kept indoors.  I plan on keeping it indoors, at least through the winter, and putting it in full blast sun in my garden the rest of the year.  Right now, it is in my sunroom, which is not heated but does not go below freezing. It may be a little drafty, IDK. 

My questions:

How can the plant be tolerant to cold weather but not a drafty window?  

Would it be better to put it in my basement, where I have grow lights, no drafts and a steady temperature around 69F? 

Should I transplant it into a larger container now, or in the spring?  The note that came on the plant says to transplant ""after the holidays,"" but seems like doing it in the winter would be traumatic.

I came out this morning and my avo plants leaves are drooping. my sunflower seems to have receding petals. My Blushing Beauty succulent has softened leaves too. My mint plant! oh, the poor thing. it looks very sad. The basil seems to be the only one who survived the night without any sadness to it.   
can any one give me some pointers on maintaining Basil, Mint, Sunflowers, Avocado Trees, Succulents?"|waddayatalkinbeet93|False|https://redd.it/ejpart|1|1.0|0|1|1|gardening

I tried to research but couldn't find clear answers.

I'm using [this](https://www.amazon.de/Insekten-frei-Bek%C3%A4mpfung-Sch%C3%A4dlingen-Buchsbaumz%C3%BCnsler-Zierpflanzen/dp/B00P7Z7LM8/ref=sr_1_6?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=trauerm%C3%BCcken&qid=1577293371&smid=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&sr=8-6&th=1) neem oil as I have soil indoors where I am trying to grow onions, garlic, basil, salad and peppers, tomatoes (using grow lights), in total 6 flower beds, the soil got affected with flies, probably fungus gnuts and other flies, could be onion flies.

Now it seems new larvae and new flies (similar but have white parts and move their wings differently) appeared - I guess onion flies, I recently planted about 12 garlics and 2 onions as I read they might repell pests.

The neem oil bottle claims: ""10,6 g/l Azadirachtin A"" and says also I should use it max ""4 times per vegetation period or culture"" whatever that means exactly.

Now I mixed 5ml of this neem oil bottle with 1l of water for 3 days in a row, it means now I should not use anymore the neem oil until the next season starts?

&#x200B;

**Currently it seems the neem oil has zero effects, every day more and more of whatever small flies (fungus gnats? onion flies?) are coming up every day, please tell me how often can I apply the neemoil in about, I guess since it wasn't effective I need to apply more?!**

**It's sad that humanity can do a lot of things like fast computers in the size of watches but seems to be unable to fight tiny flies!**

I cant take picture of them, no good camera to use.

Is it more effective to just throw out garlics an onions so atleast I won't have onion flies?"|dodsen92|False|https://redd.it/ejkreh|1|1.0|0|3|1|gardening
ejhf1h|2020-01-03 16:06:18|Mini greenhouse heated by propane furnace exhaust?|"Our central heat furnace sits on the south side of our house, and the exhaust blows out along the house. I'm envisioning some way to use this to warm a small greenhouse enough to grow plants through the winter. I'm working on some way to have it heat some water containers or other thermal mass which then heats the greenhouse, but...

If I were to just have it directly blow into the greenhouse, does anyone know if the exhaust would be detrimental to vegetable plants? People use ventless propane heaters all the time inside. Or would it produce any chemicals that would carry though to edible parts? I imagine leafy produce would be the most suspect, and then fruity parts, and then root crops.

Really considering just using it like a heated cold frame to really jumpstart the season easily instead of bothering with grow lights and such. As long as the exhaust didn't harm the plants, I doubt there would be any effect on the parts we eat as they would form after the plant was moved to the garden.

Ideas?

*Edit: Ok, time to try and explain myself better, and even change a bit after some comments. First, calling it a cold frame or a greenhouse doesn't really fit. It would be more like some raised beds along the south wall of the house with an about 3' tall insulating box around them, with room in front and\or behind. The house wall, the grow boxes, and any water containers would act as thermal mass. I plan to send the exaust through this box, probably through a duct, either through a water mass or under the grow box. I am in Zone 8a in the U.S. South, I don't think a cold frame or whatever you would call this would need much help for most of the winter with cold hardy crops. It would even be a little self regulating, since the furnace comes on more often the colder it gets.*

*The idea goes off the rails when trying to decide if I could keep it even warmer by introducing the exhaust directly. The thermal mass would still be in there. It may actually not be as effective as the above plan, but I can tinker and problem solve that. But will the exaust fumes harm the plants, and will it transfer into the produce we eat from it.*

*Also, the humidity issue has been mentioned, so I might end up scrapping it all and going back to ducting it through anyways.*

**Tldr: Would propane exaust ~~be a bad way to heat a vegetable greenhouse?~~ harm vegetable plants, or us if we consume the vegetables?**"|rockytart|False|https://redd.it/ejhf1h|2|1.0|0|19|1|gardening

When we moved to this house 3 years ago we were really excited about having a garden. However, our plot is really negleted and, even after weeding it out a couple of times, it looks like this.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h72pn47pfi841.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecd5338deec1b47f8f5a1c0872559f07da9eff4b

I'd love to have grass and a vegetable garden and this was one of my new year resolutions. I've been researching a bit, but since I don't know anything about plants, I'm a bit lost and I thought about asking for everyone's help!

First, a description: this backyard has two plots of land, about 6x3meters and two small areas near the wall on the left, which are about 40cm wide. At the moment we have weeds: I identified them with plantsnap and apparently they are ""vanilla grass"", common nettle and ""vitis vinifera"". There is also a grapevine tree (on the right) that gives some really sour white grapes every August, a vile evil tree (which is actually a local poisonous bush that grew up to the size of a tree), a rose and a cabbage that we planted last year and that is now growing over the surrounding paths' concrete. There is also a parasite tree on the left that actually belongs to the neighbours, but that is growing wildly on our side as well.

Now, I have a couple of questions and, if you could please answer, it would help me a lot on planning the transformation of my garden into something less ugly! 

First of all, I'd like to know what's the best way to deal with these weeds. We tried weeding by hand three times and they always come back before we have time to work out the ground (digging and fertilizing). I've read about weed poison, but I'm afraid I'd kill the vine tree, the rose and the cabbage (the evil tree can go, since it's already spawning offspring around it). What would be your advice?

My second question has to do about the timing for digging and making this land a bit more fertile. At the moment it is really cold and frosty, even though I live in a pretty warm mediterranian country. Would January be a nice month to start out with digging around and adding fertilizer, or should I wait till spring? If I have to wait, what can I do meanwhile to help?

Thank you so much for any advice, I'll keep everyone posted on the evolution of jungle to garden! Also, happy new year!"|SaladadeJop|False|https://redd.it/ejbtda|3|0.83|0|8|1|gardening

ej9o9d|2020-01-03 03:45:13|Help!! Jasmine Plant Drying Up|"Hi everyone,

I am looking for any suggestions on how to better care for my jasmine bush. I am not quite reddit savvy enough to figure out how to post a photo. So sorry! But, here’s the general story. 

I got the jasmine plant back in about July. Really nice plant, kept it outside until about late September when it started to get a bit chillier (I’m in Massachusetts). Brought it in, had it near my sliding door to my patio so it got a decent amount of sunlight still, and it flowered beautifully. It flowered for probably about a whole month, if not more. It was doing great and seemed super healthy. But then as soon as the flowering stopped and the flowers naturally fell away, it started dropping a ton of leaves! The leaves just totally dry up. No brown, no yellow, just straight from a nice normal leaf to a crinkly green leaf within the span of a day or two it seems. The stems are all still green and there doesn’t appear to be any rot. 

At the point of moving it inside I was afraid to overwater, since I’ve had some trouble with root rot in woody stemmed plants in the past when they come inside from out, so I was probably underwatering a bit. I’ve since corrected for that (I think) and keep the soil quite moist now. But it hasn’t seemed to help at all! I’ve even started to mist it with a spray bottle, yet the leaves keep drying up and falling off. I’ve moved the plant away from the slider in case it was an issue of any draft, but I didn’t see any difference from that. I’m afraid if this keeps up there won’t be much of a plant to make a comeback once I can put it outside for the summer. 

Is it worth investing in a humidifier? I’m not sure exactly what the problem is. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 

Thank you"|Biophd2017|False|https://redd.it/ej9o9d|2|1.0|0|9|1|gardening

ej8lo6|2020-01-03 02:21:05|Buying a house that can support both a mamey and mango tree|"Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post, but looking for advice. I know my end outcome, but not much more. I have the freedom to change just about everything about my life right now, and am free to move within or out of the country. I'm trying to decide whether and where to buy a house, how much land I'd need, the type of soil to look for, and if what I'm after is even truly feasible. I'm also interested in hearing in what other places in the world these crops could all grow in (naturally, no greenhouses). I'm currently envisioning southern FL.

Okay, don't laugh, but my objectives are to grow enough fruit to have 1-2+ a day, possibly multiplied by 3-5 as my household grows:

MVP: mamey sapotes, mangoes, and papaya (from a dwarf tree, this seems to have an incredible yield and to be fairly low maintenance)

More space/work: pineapple (though this seems to have a bad work/space/yield ratio), coconut, and avocado (substituting one for another given whether they're in season. Plantain trees I'd add, but the stores usually have both good, cheap, and easy to find ones, so it isn't as much of a priority.

I'd also love to plant smaller crops, possibly tomatoes (which taste significantly better when fresh), cacao (I had this as a houseplant and loved it), spinach, and any other relatively low effort/space ones I can grow (onions?). I could also happily envision having chickens, if only for eggs (roommates had these in the backyard), and maybe bees. I'd like to also learn to spearfish, and would prefer to live on or very close to the ocean. 

My goal isn't to make money, nor do I need to have all fruits available at all times. I don't need to be entirely self-sufficient. I could happily deal with the mameys/mangos all becoming ripe 'at once' only once a year by freezing or giving away the fruit. I'd been looking to find a fairly small house with a relatively 'large' yard with enough room to plant a tree in front and back, which would fit my MVP. But I'm not sure exactly how far these trees need to be planted away from other houses, etc. Realistically, I'm also coming to terms that the public schools are all horrible in S FL, the job market is poor, it's a bit lacking in cultural activities/the arts, *and* the houses are all super expensive (??).... which brings me to my next points:

\- where can mameys actually grow? It looks like I'd be limited to S FL, Mexico, Cuba, Costa Rica, and the countries in between on this side of the globe. Is that accurate?

\- how many feet / how large of a 'lot' would I truly need to grow one tree in the front and back of the house? (mamey in front by the street, perhaps, and mango in the back)

\- what kind of soil would I need?

\- realistically, what sort of 'maintenance' would I need to perform, and how often? (in a climate where these grow naturally)

\- anything else I haven't thought of?

Also, were I to change my mind and go all out with creating a whole mamey tree farm.... how much land would I need for that?"|whoiamidonotknow|False|https://redd.it/ej8lo6|1|1.0|0|14|1|gardening

I'm in a really old house (1840s end terrace) which has a huge mould/damp problem. It's also quite a cold house and difficult to heat in winter, fab in summer as it stays cool! 

I'm looking for some cat-safe house plants which clear the air in the house and help to get rid of some of the mould/damp.

So far I can only think of spider plants but I'm sure there'll be more than that. Something that likes moist bathrooms would be good too! 

Just wondering if anyone had any recommendations of anything low maintenance and hard to kill?

Edit, thanks for the comments.

I'm renting my house so can't install anything/alter things.  The landlord has already done all the damp proofing and work he can possibly do. The house is just old and probably needs gutting, or taking down and rebuilding tbh. We have dehumidifiers dotted around and that helps somewhat, but it's still mouldy.

eivusv|2020-01-02 08:54:24|How to bring flowers back from the brink of death?|Ages ago I got an alyssium and a petunia and planted them in the backyard, they were doing really well but since it’s gotten hotter (summer over here in australia) they’ve been in really bad shape. The petunia is almost all brown now but still has some green and purple from the closed flowers, and the alyssium is pretty much all green, she’s just a bit brown near the middle and is really crispy feeling. I kind of neglected them since I started my garden in the front yard, and I spend more time in the front than the back. Today I dug them up as carefully as I could and moved them into temporary pots near my other flowers, I put them in good soil and added some water crystals, but i’m wondering if there’s anything I could do to ensure they stay alive? I’m relatively new to gardening and feel pretty bad that I let them get this way.|badwclf|False|https://redd.it/eivusv|1|1.0|0|2|1|gardening

eiqdcd|2020-01-02 00:28:45|Help create a proper soil “blend”?|"Hi! I need to create a bulk soil that can be used for multiple things in my yard. 

My natural soil is pretty good but very much clay based. 

I am planning on buying a few cubic yards of a soil/compost mix from local landscape supply store. They sell 50/50 up to 70/30 (what do you recommend?) 

But my main question is what to add to that soil for the following:

1. Container grown potato vines. 
2. Container grown hydrangea
3. Ground grown iceberg roses (do I mix with my original soil? )
4. Ground grown hydrangea
5. Container and ground grown morning glory vines.
6. I need to slope some of my grass a bit because I put down a paver walkway and the lip is too high. So I will need to cut and slope the grass and put some soil underneath. 

So here is what I was thinking:

Make a big giant mix of the purchased compost/soil mix. Add in some part of my existing soil using the soil taken out for the 5 gallon plants to go in. (How much original soil?) And then add in.... ??? This is where I need the most help. ....Thinking perlite, peat moss maybe? Sand ? From what I can tell all four of the flowers /vines like a well draining rich soil...and my clay stuff doesn’t drain that well. 

Ps: I am in Southern California zone 9b. Temecula, CA 92592.

ein6w5|2020-01-01 20:21:41|Detail question regarding garlic, onion growth cycle|"Hi,

I recently planted the following plants:

1. Onions (Bought a supermarket onion, cut the top half of, planted the bottom part in soil).
2. Garlic (Bought a glove from a market, planted the individual cloves in soil).

Now the onion & garlic seem to be very fast and growin new, green and long leaves.

If I let the leaves grow for some weeks (and cut off any possible flowers forming), cut half of it and leave the other half so the plant can do photosynthesis still, will the plants die after 3 cutting cycles or do their cells regenerate?

I tried this once with scallions and most of them died/stopped growing after cutting them a few times.

I saw there are plants like peppers, mint which are able to form new plants from cuttings (asexual propagation?), but how do garlic, onion cells behave, can they regenerate or will they die eventually?

I thought garlics & onions have big bulbs to store nutrients, maybe they last longer than bulbless scallions?

Anyone did this?
