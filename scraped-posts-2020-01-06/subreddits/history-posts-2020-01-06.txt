ekmkzh|2020-01-06 01:29:53|I just discovered World at War (1973 documentary on WW2)?|"I’ve previously watched a significant amount of film regarding WW2 from documentaries to cinema, and I can honestly say, this documentary has captured me in an entirely new way. 

It goes through the history of WW2 a couple months a time theatre by theatre and starts with the build up to WW2. What’s incredible to me is that as opposed to new docs released these days, many people who lived through these experiences at the time, including key decision makers, were still alive and well in 1973. The format of the doc is a mix of historical footage, narration, and many in person interviews with such people, from those on the ships at Pearl Harbor, to those in Hitlers bunker with him. The best part about this is that you get small tidbit stories that don’t make it into most stuff these days, like the story of the Chaplain walking the deck of the USS West Virginia at Pearl  Harbor saying “Praise the Lord, Pass the Ammo!”

Highly recommend this documentary. Adjusted for inflation I believe I read online it’s one of the most expansive documentaries ever put together, and was the most expensive production in Britain at the time (total of 900k pounds in ‘73 dollars).

There a few YouTube videos of this still
up but I ended up torrenting the whole thing. It’s  over twenty hour long episodes in total."|Jenksz|False|https://redd.it/ekmkzh|1910|0.95|0|192|1|history

eko7sm|2020-01-06 03:38:53|Mysterious cave with ancient drawings in my hometown|"Greetings guys!

I live in the small town in western Serbia which has a large hill splitting the town in two. 

This hill is called Djulim which is a derivatory name from turkish djul which was, as far as i know, garden of roses.

However, this hill has a neckton of myths that surround it. The reason why is because there are numerous caves in all different sides of the hill, some filled with water, some empty and some are ruins of an old antimony mine. But, in several of these caves there are inscriptions that look extremely old and odd. Similar to cave paintings that you see in history books, yet different. How? Well...

Some of those drawings include two-headed people, gigantic tiger like creatures but with horns and coloured red, weird symbols that differ a lot from local known existing cultures, and, most interesting ones, dates. Earliest one being written is 323. AD and newest one being 1873. 

In 1974. team of Yugoslav archeologists from Belgrade came here and wanted to explore this caves, and after doing a carbon analysis they found out that all of the inscriptions, including dates (written in arabic numerals) are, at least 1000 years old. Odd, right? Well prepare yourself...

Two months after investigations started, numerous citizens reported glowing light from the cave that occured for couple of minutes and then stopped. Next couple of weeks, archeologists found a passage, tight and narrow, which had drawn depictions of people drowning in the cave and depiction in old slavic alphabet saying “Ones who seek shall drown”. Several weeks later, biggest flood ever (well, at least until 2014) has struck the town, and caused errosions which closed the enterance to the cave, leaving an opening size of the average dog.

Investigations have stopped due to this events and no one ever came back to explore this cave.

Today, the opening is still visible and a vast ammount of drawings can be seen with flash turned on, including most of the ones mentioned above.

Some say the cave is a tomb, some say it’s a maze, some say it’s time portal and stories go on and on.

If anyone is interested, i can take some pictures tomorrow and edit them into this post.

What do you think about this? Do you have any explanations behind this?

Since diamonds definitely do not dissolve in wine, or almost anything else, I assume that if this did take place that the diamond was ground to dust and then added to the wine.  But I can't find anywhere else this story is contained.  There are other stories about Gresham crushing a pearl and drinking it to impress an ambassador, but I can't find any other reference to this supposed diamond drinking online.

The only way I can seem to reconcile this with the rest of his ideas, which are largely against centralization and very pro-human, truth and harmony with nature, is that the world simply didn't know the details and extent of what had happened until much later. I also haven't really learned anything about Maoism yet, so is he simply praising Mao's ideas/writing and unaware of how they weren't actually put into action? 

Here's an excerpt from a speech he gave:

> You can't be alive today without being interested in China, because it's the biggest transformation that's happened in the twentieth century. This enormous country, sick unto death for so many decades, suddenly, in one generation, turns itself around. People are fed, cheerful, everybody's at work, enthusiastic, they're all drably but adequately clothed, children are in fantastically good shape, full of buoyancy and cheerfulness. If you compare that with China in the 1920s and 1930s, it's a miraculous transformation. It's 
still a very, very poor society. But it's a poor society where the basic requirements are being met. 

> Various things have happened. Virtually from the demise of the Manchus in 1911 until Mao in 1948-49 were years of the most intense suffering. Out of this suffering there were born some people, undoubtedly of quite extraordinary intellectual power and stature, such as Mao and Chou En-lai, and they have built a new society there. As an economist, I would say what they have done primarily is to turn economics the other way around. Our type of economics says, ""You mustn't do anything, mustn't produce anything, unless you are quite sure you couldn't possibly buy it cheaper from outside."" When I was in Puerto Rico, a luscious island, I found that the carrots were imported from Texas! You mustn't produce carrots in Puerto Rico if the Texas-produced carrots are cheaper. That's our system. The Chinese have turned this around. They have said, ""You mustn't buy anything from outside unless you can be quite sure you can't make it yourself."" It's as simple as that. When you say, ""You mustn't produce unless you are quite sure you couldn't buy it more cheaply"", then development is impeded. On the other hand, when you say ""you mustn't buy it unless it is really impossible for you to make it"", economically speaking everybody is challenged, everybody is busy.

Marc Lépine, a 25 years old man, entered the school with a carbine and a knife and opened fire. His targets where mainly female students, because he hated the feminism that some woman showed. In less than 20 minutes, he killed fourteen young women that were students in this school and injured thirteen other students, four young men and nine young women. The shooting started a bit after four o’clock. 

In more details :

At four o’clock PM, Marc Lépine entered the building with a white bag and sat down for multiple minutes, not responding to the personnel’s questions. He then walked in the building before entering a class on the second floor. The class was composed of about 60 students when Marc Lépine entered it. He told the students to separate into two groups, woman and man. Since no one was taking him seriously, he took his gun and shot a bullet towards the roof of the class. The nine women were told to stay in the class while the men were ordered to get out. He then asked if any of the girls knew what they were doing here, and everyone said no. He then answered that he was fighting feminism. A girl answered that not all of them were feminist, and that they were just students that were studying engineering. Lépine answered that they were girls that would become engineers, that they were just stupid feminists and that he hated feminists. He then opened fire on the group of girls, injuring 3 girls and killing the other sixth. Lépine continue his rampage in the corridors, injuring three students before trying to kill a young girl twice. Knowing that he was running ou of ammunition, he went back to he stairs were he left his white bag and went back to the class were he had fist entered. The door was now blocked/locked, and he tried to open it. He shot three times on it before abandoning and continuing his walk in the corridors. He injured another person before killing another woman that had just locked the door to her office. He went to the cafeteria, where a hundred of students panicked and ran towards the exits. The kitchen of the cafeteria had been locked, so the students had no other choices but run. A woman played dead on the floor, and Marc Lépine shot the woman right next to her. He injures another one, kills two girls that were hiding in a storage room and spare two students that were hiding under the tables because they accepted to show themselves when he asked for it. He goes up to the third floor, injures 4 other students. He enters another class, opening fire on the students and killing four women and injuring 3 other. He stabs one that was pleading for help after being injured, and, finally, after all of that, takes of his cap, surrounds his gun with his coat and shoots himself in the head. He still had sixty bullets in his white bag.


Victims :

The majority of them were students, but some of them were working at the school. All of them were women.

Did our forefathers inadvertently supplant virtue with the law?|"I've come across this narrative several times, most recently in a WSJ book review by Samuel Goldman on 12/27/19.  It goes something like this: in the old days, nobility believed in the concept of virtue, even if they didn't practice it.  This was a significant part of Western political ethos, and John Adams believed that virtuous and wise people cannot be subjected to tyranny.  But when the law began to take hold in Western Europe and North America, virtue slowly gave way to law - so that one could whatever as long as it is legal! 

Again, I've come across this narative several times, and am getting a little tired of it because I've found no evidence in the history of America or UK (I am that knowledgeable in French, Spanish, Dutch or German histories) that somehow law or our American constitution superseded the value of virtue in our societies and politics.

ehy6xb|2019-12-31 05:01:48|Chinese Revolution|"Chapter I
1922-1937
Life for the Chinese masses was enduring miserable horrible suffering and at the end of the day very had little more then that to expect come the next. The starving peasants crawled across the street many were homeless and unemployed and those who weren't worked like slaves in horrible conditions. The government was an autocratic oligarchy made up of the feudal lords. While it was now the 1920s as far as the Chinese people were concerned that might as well have been the 1420s. There was horrific suffering, famine, disease, and tyrany. Many historians refer to this period in Chinese history as ""the Warlord Era"" due to the fact that the state had pardoned many politically powerful mass murderers who now terrorized the Chinese masses. Only about 10% of Chinese children were able to receive an education past what their parents could teach them and medicine was no better than in 1700s.

Prostitution, poverty, and violence were all common place. There was a fear of the horrific govornment which existed in a disturbing superposition of anarchic and totalitarian. But despite all the horrific suffering of the Chinese people at large the ruling elite (ie the former feudal lords and members of the former empirial family) used slave labor to ensure that they lived a quality of life comparable to their European counterparts. A national currency that exists but it was only used by the richest 5% of the population The peasants on the other hand used food and firewood to barter.


Chapter II
1930-1939
Not surprisingly the Chinese masses started to strike and riot, their leader was a man in his 20s named Mao Zedong he was an incredibly well-read intellectual who spoke Mandarin, Cantonese, and English (he also spoke Latin, Russian,and Georgian but not well enough to hold up a conversation); he had read to teachings of history's greatest philosophers but among them his favorite was Karl Marx, for Karl Marx had published political theory that was not a philosophy but a science direct dialectical materialist analysis of history, not as much an invention as it was a discovery.

Fearing their overthrow the leaders of the Chinese government banned the Communist party, but the masses did not give up so easily and continued to riot demanding a better life. Mao himself had retreated into the jungles where he lived amongst the most impoverished and outcasted of the Chinese peasantry; first he learned from them, then he thought them. By 1937 the people's revolution was on the brink of victory when Japan invaded. Mao made a temporary truce with the ruler of the Chinese regime in order to fight a greater evil.


Chapter III
1939-1948
In 1939 Germany invaded the rest of Europe starting WWII, the war between Japan and China had previously been called sino-japanese war but was now seamed part of a larger conflict. Churchill offered no assistance to the struggling in desperate Chinese people and FDR didn't even care about the war yet. All hope seemed lost and talk of surrender began, but Mao said the following ""We shall heal our wounds, we shall gather our dead, and we shall continue fighting!""; the Chinese masses were inspired by these brave words from their leader and managed to hold out. Churchill and FDR had both shown apathy to the struggling Chinese masses, but Stalin did send reinforcements to help them. In 1941 both the U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. had entered the war; by 1945 the Axis powers had been defeated.

The U.S. had resorted to the immeasurably cruel act of using a nuclear weapons on civilians which struck fear into the world. The U.S. abruptly started sending soldiers in as renforcements for the old Chinese regime. Mao and his comrades were begining to progress against the old regime; a very high ranking U.S. general named Douglas MacArthur suggested they drop 50 nuclear bombs on China, as disturbing and horrific an idea as that may seem the U.S. actually gave it legitimate consideration, eventually they decided not to and the U.S. agreed to let the Chinese people live in peace. How horrifically close the U.S. came to actually dropping those bombs is what made the Soviet Union decide that it was necessary for them to develop their own atomic bombs, in 1948 the ""Cold War"" began. On October 1st of 1949 Mao Zedong declared that the People's Republic of China was now in existence 🇨🇳.

A remarkable aspect of its invention, noted by David Anthony, is that it took barely a few centuries for it to diffuse from as far as Denmark to Iraq, indicating that this was a breakthrough technological achievement. And indeed it was complex engineering, it wasn't simply a matter of cutting a round piece of wood and sticking things together.


I know that the Bronze Age permitted for the first time the use of metal tools, especially tools to cut wood in exact fitting shapes. This allowed people to go from rafts and canoes to ships made of tight fitting planks with hugely increased carrying capacity. My question is what do we know about the interplay of bronze know-how and the wildfire-like diffusion of the wagon in those few centuries before the Bronze Age started. The wagon would have been a perfect candidate to kickstart the development of bronze making. It was evidently something that suddenly everybody wanted, as evidenced by its wildfire-like diffusion in a few centuries to every corner of west Eurasia, and it was at the same time something that would have either obligatorily required bronze tools or at least would have benefited hugely from their usage because of the need to produce parts of exacting dimensions."|kormanol|False|https://redd.it/ehlb2o|7|0.89|0|1|1|history

There are times when my brain tends to *devour* various historical sources, biographies, lectures, or encyclopedias. If a subject matter or time period fascinates me, I’d probably look for mediums that’d help enrich my engagement.

As for *Napoleon: A Life*, I stumbled upon this biography in Audible. Like anyone else who’s a fan of history, I already *knew enough* about Napoleon, but I didn’t *know everything.* So, I thought the audiobook would provide some worthwhile tidbits of info.

33 hours later, and I couldn’t believe how much about the man — this historical figure who casts a looming shadow due to his accomplishments (and his missteps) — I hadn’t discovered yet until that point.

I learned of how he acted like your quintessential lovestruck and hopeless romantic, almost r/niceguys material, especially with his desperate letters to Josephine.

I found out how the British had captured some of these letters and published them to his embarrassment. Yet, at the same time, some Brits also saw him as a sympathetic figure in spite of never-ending wars. Napoleon even managed to charm enemy sailors as he was being taken to St. Helena.

I learned of his passion for history, and how much he had admired Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire, and, as such, wanted to emulate the successes and legacies of the man and the realm.

I found out how he tiptoed from casual observer in Corsica, to full-on revolutionary in France, to, later on, realizing how chaotic and anarchic these changes were, to the point that he also couldn’t resist the allure of power.

I heard of the massive changes, meritocracy, and sweeping reforms which are still considered as cornerstones for many of the institutions in modern-day France and other European nations. I knew of some of these already, but never ways that fully explained the gravity of these changes.

I learned more about Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, one of the French marshals who never got along with Napoleon. The guy ended up marrying Nap’s ex-fiancee. He was later offered the Swedish crown (the Swedish king had no heirs and parliament wanted to have that French military zeal). He accepted and, a couple of years later, joined yet another coalition *against* Napoleon. He was instrumental in defeating Napoleon’s other marshals prior to and during the Battle of Leipzig. Oh, and his descendants — the House of Bernadotte — still rule Sweden to this day. Yes, the Swedish royal family is descended from one of Napoleon’s marshals who basically had some random noble go: “Hey, fella, wanna be king? We really like you, monsieur.”

I heard more about Napoleon’s family: his siblings whom he placed in positions of authority despite not having the same charisma or skill, and even arranging a marriage for one of his brothers to his step-daughter. What the?

Oh, and the glorious battles of the Napoleonic Wars. From Arcole to Acre, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau, the Peninsular Campaign, Borodino, the disastrous retreat from Moscow, and, of course, Waterloo. I had already known about several of these battles, but never in so much fascinating detail.

I’ve read numerous biographies and history books over the years. There were very few that left a sombre note  — you felt as though you’ve gotten to know so much about an individual, that, once you’re done reading/listening, it felt like waving goodbye as well. This was one of those occasions.

eh3ke4|2019-12-29 08:15:53|What decides the name when two or more rivers meet at the confluence point? Is Ganga really the longest river in India|"As a general rule  when two or more rivers meet at the confluence point: it is either the volume of water or length of the merging river that decides the name of the new river. 

However then why we see so many anomalies to this rule especially in ancient civilizations, surely a few can be explained by some old mythological reason, probably a few to some ignorance of those times but certainly not so many. 

 Rivers as part of our geological phenomenon is constantly changing & evolving which means that the rivers are constanty changing their course (both length & direction) and also changes are being brought about in their water flow levels 

The rivers are many millenia old & their status, names that are given to them are equally that old & hence these names don't change as dynamically & relatively frequently (when compared to the age of the rivers) when the status or position of the rivers change. Nowhere is this more exmplified than in ancient civilizations that are many thousands of years old like in India, where we see these anomalies abound, like in Prayagraj at the confluence of Ganga & Yamuna etc.

Effective 1985-87 Dry Law by Horbachov significantly restricted retail sale of alcohol, shut down specialized liquor stores, enforced punishment for drinking, destroyed vineyards and production facilities. The law in fact had made vodka an actual legit currency, alternative to worthless Ruble, since everything was in deficit during Perestroika. 4 years later angry Soviet mob demolished the empire and discarded the whole communist dream in pursuit of accessible booze and other sought-after nice things.

Pictured below is 7 kg cast iron ""Medal for boozing"", introduced by Peter the Great in 1714 for excessive drinking, awarded by the local police.

Now of course the U.S government didn't like this so they told the Canadian government to crack down on it.

(""From Forraine Parts"" non-English Europeans at Jamestown, 1607-1625 - Bill Wardr) Early in the history of English colonization especially at Jamestow, the charther companies and leaders such as John Smith would recruit workers from mainland Europe to come to build their new colony: Contemporary historical accounts refer to this first group of foreign craftsmen as Dutchmen and Poles([Smith, John (1624). ""VII"". The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles-The generall historie of Virginia, New England & the Summer Isles, together with The true travels, adventures and observations.](https://www.loc.gov/resource/lhbcb.0262a)) These laborers started producing comedies such as glassware, pitch, and potash, important because they were the first goods exported from the colony to Europe. When the first elections in the colony were held in 1619, the colony did not allow any continental settlers to vote. They were denied the right to vote on the grounds that they were not of English descent. The craftsmen in response, refused to work unless they were given the right to vote. Under this labor pressure, the Virginia Company's Council reversed the decision to disenfranchise the craftsmen, and simultaneously struck an agreement with the craftsmen to apprentice young men from the colony. The company leaders feared not only the loss of income and labor, but that the colony might gain a reputation for not being welcoming to further settlers not of English descent, especially skilled craftsmen.

Taking into consideration how afraid the founding fathers were of tyranny, it would seem natural to have written something about it in the constitution. 

I've done a fair share of research on the topic and have found out that whilst Washington only served 2 terms it wasn't actually him who started the so-called two-term tradition. That was Jefferson, who was very outspoken on the matter and was a proponent of introducing term limits. 

Whilst there were many branches of government, especially local that had term-limits this was not the case for the presidency and I wonder why?

One explanation, which Washington himself gave was that if a candidate was fit to run for a third term and was very well-liked, he shouldn't be considered un-fit because of the mere fact that he was running for a third term. Secondly, the constitution had enough power to overthrow a potential tyrant, making having a specific amendment on the matter obsolete.

Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome.

He practically ruled the world most powerful empire of 16th century, together with Suleiman from 1523 - 1526.

Due to long term influence and intrigues of Suleiman beloved wife  Hurrem, who intrigued against Ibrahim because he supported Suleiman first born son Mustafa, seed of the discord against pasha was sow. She convinced sultan that Ibrahim want to take sultan place. 

During the campaign against the persians, Ibrahim used the title Sultan. However, Suleiman promised Ibrahim that during his reign, Ibrahim life will be safe. 

Sultan asked his wisest advisor about the way how he can execute Ibrahim. 

He was adviced that because he will break the promise given to friend, he must build a mosque for Allah. 

Before the execution, sultan dinnered 7 times with his life long friend, hoping he will flee and give Ibrahim a chance to kill him. 

Ibrahim , although he probably knew whats going on, stayed at the palace near sultan. 

At 7th day, Grand Vizier was found strangled at his chamber. 

Suleiman never totally recovered from his best friend execution, expressed his sadness at poems, refused to rule the empire for the while mourning for Ibrahim.

Ibrahim Pasha was also extreme capable military leader, even better diplomat and politician.

His military leader portfolio

1521 - Siege of Belgrade

1522 - Capture of Rhodes

1525- Traveled to Egypt after Ahmed pasha rebellion reformed local provincial civil and military administration system.

1526 - MOHACS battle, served as the leader of Ottoman army, had biggest part of the army at command, played major and  active role at the one of the most impressive military victories of all time, personally led forces to battle, fought himself according to legends.

1527 - Dealt with Sah Kalender rebellion against Ottoman empire politics, used diplomatic and and leadership skills

1529- Led the army during siege of Vienna, which many consider as the defeat of the Ottoman , while Ottomans claimed it as a victory many times

1532 - Siege of Guns, leader of  an army, Ottoman fortified position at Hungary , captured several fortresses

1534- succesfull campaing against Safavid dynasty at Persia, captured Tabriz and Bagdad, u to 1535, when he was called back to Istanbul

As you can see, thats pretty impressive portfolio, i would say much better than some Nazi generals, whose are much more praised as the leaders.

As a diplomat and politician Ibrahim was even better dealt many profitable trade pacts with Venice or France. He was also patron of art and culture.

Considering his military campaign portfolio, him ruled the Ottoman empire for 13 years and diplomatic success, he is one of the most fascinating historical figures for me."|1982mathew|False|https://redd.it/efgzbs|11|0.72|0|16|1|history

Given massive hemorrhage has been pretty much the number one reason of preventable death on the battlefield throughout humanity, and if compressible hemorrhage was possible back then, when did junctional wound packing become a thing? Closer to the times of firearms?

If any, what was the predecessor to a pressure bandage, or was amputation the result of tourniquet application back then?

Using flame during sieges, I assume soldiers occasionally got inhalation or facial burns. Along with facial burns, facial trauma (such as a sword slash to the lips/nose) preventing a patent airway, was there any treatment to open up airways back then? Something similar to a cricothyroidotomy? Maybe even NPAs or OPAs?

When did ventilators begin? I assume they go far back, as they are simple to make (probably could make one out of pig skin, like an American football), and casualties would probably complain of shortness of breath, and, grand civilizations such as the Romans or Greeks could find a solution.

With the invention of plate armor, as well as blunt force weapons, pneumothorax, I suspect killed quite a few after battles, when did needle chest decompressions or chest tubes (or any treatment for pneumothorax) begin?

What was to go to antibiotic for penetrating wounds (I assume this one would vary on each civilization, but, I have requests specifically for Roman, and Viking (Iceland, Faroe Islands, and Greenland).

How interchangeable were ancient and medieval currencies?

* The Drachma and Sestertius were made of Silver. The Aureus was made of Gold. The Shekels were made of either Silver or Electrum. One can see that having non-interchangeable currencies made of different materials required money changers.
* In [*Imperator: Rome*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperator:_Rome) currency is named ""Gold"". Was Gold really recognised as a baseline for the value of currencies in the ancient era?
   * If 2 countries both had currency made gold (or if they both had currency made of silver), does that make their currency readily interchangeable? For example:
      * If a trader had [Gaullic Gold coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_coinage) but not Roman Aureus, could they have bought goods with an identical quantity of Puranas in a Drachma-using area?

   * If currencies weren't interchangeable, what's the point of even having separate currencies if it would consist of Gold or Silver (both rare metals) just like other nation's coinages?
* If coins back then were made of gold and silver, when did nations decide to start stabilising their wealth by storing gold bars?"|Real_Carl_Ramirez|False|https://redd.it/eeu4f9|22|0.72|0|3|1|history

Therefor what u wonder is if anyone in here know how long it took before the ice really catched on and how long it took for the refuilling network to be sufficient enough to make longer trips.

I'm trying to find out the size of an average Mongol clan before the time of the Mongol Empire, when they were unified.

I've only found information regarding the army sizes during the Empire: "" A Mongol cavalry army rarely exceeded 10,000 riders in any one place at one time, even the very largest campaigns such as in Europe probably contained only three such 10,000-men divisions (*tumens*), the rest of the army, perhaps triple the size of the Mongol cavalry in some cases, was made of allies who conducted warfare according to their own traditions"" ([source](https://www.ancient.eu/Mongol_Warfare/)). This suggests that there were several units at once and also that a campaign usually saw 10,000 men plus 30,000 allies.  
I would imagine such sizes would have been impossible to maintain pre-unification. The upkeep would probably have surpassed what a single nomadic clan could do - food, weapons, horses and so on. (Which makes me wonder how khalasars in ASOIAF/GOT could manage to keep 40,000 riders but that's a different story).

I did find some information about the Xiongnu state in 209 BC-93 AD: 166 BC, there was a 140,000 size cavalry. In 158 BC, 2x 60,000 cavalries. In 121 BC, an army the size of 40,000 men. But again, those were somewhat unified in a ""state"". 

So I'm curious to know if anyone has some numbers that could be compared. Less than a hundred? Hundreds? Thousands? Ten thousands? There probably were bigger and smaller clans, so that's why I'm asking about an average."|SaintDiabolus|False|https://redd.it/ee6jr9|18|0.77|0|18|1|history

I'm thinking that the first Washington Naval Treaty from 1922 also lent a hand towards this since it seems to me like it was another case of the major Allied states forcing or taking things from the others by putting shipbuilding restrictions on how much the power of the other Allied states could grow. It also seems to me that Japan especially would take offense to the later treaty restrictions from the 30s, since it also limited their intended shipbuilding designs such that most WW2 Japanese destroyers and cruisers would suffer weight balance issues from cramming firepower onto a limited weight hull. It also seems to me that neither France nor Italy paid much attention to the later treaties as well, due to their mini arms race when France built the Dunkerque-class of battleships to which Italy responded with the Littorio-class and then France in turn responded with the Richelieu-class.

Alternatively, is there any indication that things might be different or not change at all if the naval treaties from the 20s and 30s weren't ever signed?"|_Sunny--|False|https://redd.it/edvs01|5|0.88|0|2|1|history

Many people with whom I chatted with either don’t see any mystery in this (their lack of curiosity annoys me) or blame it on the British: the Brits marketed their tea from India all over the world, including in the Mid East. So tea replaced coffee as the predominant drink in the Mid East.

ecqgww|2019-12-19 08:32:05|About feudal hierarchy|"First of all, I understand that feudal system was never clear cut, but still I want to make the most sense out of it.

So I was reading the wiki page about the peerage of the kingdom of France, it says “The prestigious title and position of Peer of France (French: Pair de France) was held by the greatest, highest-ranking members of the French nobility.” And The traditional number of peers is twelve. They are:

Archbishop-Duke of Reims, premier peer

Bishop-Duke of Laon

Bishop-Duke of Langres

Bishop-Count of Beauvais

Bishop-Count of Châlons

Bishop-Count of Noyon

Duke of Normandy

Duke of Aquitaine, also called Duke of Guyenne

Duke of Burgundy

Count of Flanders

Count of Champagne

Count of Toulouse


So half of the peers are counts or bishop-counts, while a lot of dukes didn’t get admission into the peerage. And when I examined the map of France of that age, it can be seen that many of its counties are not noticeably smaller than some of the duchies. So why were those large and apparently powerful counties not promoted to duchy level? And when the count of say champagne met a duke who was not a peer, who outranked who?"|Kasperlzhang|False|https://redd.it/ecqgww|10|0.81|0|5|1|history

For example, [see Smithsonian's explanation of this](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-brief-history-of-the-salem-witch-trials-175162489/).

I’m Lucas Richert, the historical director for the [American Institute of the History of Pharmacy](https://aihp.org/) at UW-Madison, a nearly 80-year-old institute dedicated to advancing the knowledge and understanding of the history of pharmacy and medicines. I’m also co-editor in chief of [Social History of Alcohol and Drugs: An Interdisciplinary Journal](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/shad/pr/180921) and author of a new book with the MIT Press called “[Break On Through](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262042827/),” which draws on archives and government documents, medical journals, and interviews, and interweaves references to pop (counter)culture to historicize the radical mental health practices in the 1960s and 70s. I published another book (“[Strange Trips](https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Trips-Regulation-McGill-Queens-Associated/dp/0773556370)”) earlier this year that focuses on the contentious relationship between scientific knowledge, cultural assumptions, and social concerns. My hope — particularly with “Break On Through” — is to promote the discussion of mental health by placing the histories of American mental health, pharmaceutical use, and intoxicant use in dialogue with one another, all within the context of mainstream and fringe therapies.
 
Questions about the history of drugs or pharmaceuticals? The field of psychiatry in the 1960s and 70s?

If there's been 5.000 years of documented history. There, if you trace the advancements in all sciences or branches of human knowledge, you can see that engeneering has steadily improved since the dawn of history, as well as astronomy, chemistry, literature, philosophy, etc. Humans started with stone tools, then copper, then bronze, then iron, then steel, then compound materials... Medieval scientists discovered and classified distinct chemical elements, and every discovery added up to the one before it. One man postuled that Earth was round, then another added ""it moves"", and later another ""around the sun"". It was an adding of layers and layers of research.

But that's the thing with medicine. It seems to me that medicine didn't really improve and get better until 150 years ago. Holes in your head were replaced by consuming mercury pills or getting your blood sucked by leaches. Physicians could do little to nothing to really cure people for almost five millenia, and it doesn't look like any doctor in history built upon earlier discoveries, but each one looked at nature and got their own conclussions from there.

So the Teutonic Order spent their considerable resources warring with Christian states like Poland and Lithuania.

At some point Poland made an offer to the Teutonic Order, a land swap for territory adjacent to non-Christians. I'm imagining possibly for Moldova or just east of there on the Black Sea, which would put the Teutonic Order both adjacent to the Ottomans pushing North through Wallachia and adjacent the Crimean Horde raiding from the East. The Order rejected the offer and continued to war with the Poles until their downfall.

I was never able to find answers to:

\- (Semi-legendary) Sack of Rome of 390BC, after losing a battle a Gallic army led by Brennus takes Rome (except the palatine hill), initial defeat, but they win after an outbreak of plague and the arrival of Camilus with an army.

The most infamous statements to come out of him were:

"" I commanded Auschwitz until 1 December 1943, and estimate that at least 2,500,000 victims were executed and exterminated there by gassing and burning, and at least another half million succumbed to starvation and disease, making a total of about 3,000,000 dead. This figure represents about 70% or 80% of all persons sent to Auschwitz as prisoners, the remainder having been selected and used for slave labor in the concentration camp industries. Included among the executed and burnt were approximately 20,000 Russian prisoners of war (previously screened out of Prisoner of War cages by the Gestapo) who were delivered at Auschwitz in Wehrmacht transports operated by regular Wehrmacht officers and men. The remainder of the total number of victims included about 100,000 German Jews, and great numbers of citizens (mostly Jewish) from The Netherlands, France, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Greece, or other countries. We executed about 400,000 Hungarian Jews alone at Auschwitz in the summer of 1944.[46]""

When accused of murdering three and a half million people, Höss replied, ""No. Only two and one half million—the rest died from disease and starvation.""

Later on in an essay he revised his death tolls

""I myself never knew the total number, and I have nothing to help me arrive at an estimate.

I can only remember the figures involved in the larger actions, which were repeated to me by Eichmann or his deputies.

From Upper Silesia and the General Gouvernement 250,000

Germany and Theresienstadt 100,000

Holland 95,000

Belgium 20,000

France 110,000

Greece 65,000

Hungary 400,000

Slovakia 90,000 [Total 1,130,000]

I can no longer remember the figures for the smaller actions, but they were insignificant by comparison with the numbers given above. I regard a total of 2.5 million as far too high. Even Auschwitz had limits to its destructive capabilities.""

eaq4bl|2019-12-14 22:07:34|How have the world wars affected French culture, specifically family culture?|"My wife is French and being American, my experience with French culture is that they’re amazing people but also generally tend to skew a little bit towards being critical of each other and the world, a bit cold, and overall more traditionalist/risk averse. I know every culture has its nuances, but I’m curious from a historical perspective where these traits might come from. 

My hypothesis is this: they had been a major power in Europe and the world for much of the past few hundred years and with that comes a good amount of pride. Then World War One happens and that takes a massive toll in terms of lives, wealth, world outlook, pride, and I’m sure many other things I’m not thinking of. My understanding of WWI is that the French lost considerably more than some of the other allied forces, but I’m not sure if this is accurate. Either way, only two decades later, they get hit again, but simply don’t have the resources or will to go through all that again and so have to surrender. Having been a major power only 50 years previous I can see this being another huge source of pain and shame. 

All of this is to say that I can imagine parents in the 1910s through the 1950s not being in exactly the best emotional state to raise children. I can see all of that trauma maybe being passed down to their kids, and then their kids’ kids and so on, with each step manifesting itself in some sort of cultural resentment towards life/the world but without a clear source.

eaodkd|2019-12-14 19:51:37|When did the English begin branding enslaved Africans with marks of ownership?|"Hey all! I’m trying to figure out if African slaves were ever branded with marks that showed ownership between 1650 and 1670, and how common (or uncommon) it was. Examples from Barbados, Jamaica or Virginia would be appreciated.

I’ll begin with what I do know.

- By the early 18th century, there were many accounts of slave brands. Whether they were marks of ownership or something else, it’s tough to say (I didn’t see any slave brands matching their owner’s initials, albeit I took only a cursory look through the compiled list). Many brands were noted in this list of Jamaican advertisements for 18th century runaways: https://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00021144/00001 (found via u/RTarcher ‘s wonderful answer to a similar question. Check it out here if interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/72sb1f/were_slaves_in_the_americas_and_caribbean_branded/). Unfortunately, I’ve been unable to find a similar document covering the period I’m exploring.

- In the Barbados Slave Code of 1661, a slave could have his face burned by hot irons as punishment for assaulting a Christian. In 1643, Virginia passed laws that two-time runaways are to be branded on the cheek with the letter ‘R’ (there were also instances of this punishment being used for white indentured servants). Unfortunately, neither mention branding used as property.

- The Spanish *seemed* to use branding to mark ownership of indigenous slaves during the 16th century. Slaves brought to harvest pearls in the waters of Cubagua were ‘marked on the face and on the arms by a hot iron with a letter of C (whose meaning we have not been able to verify but may have been a mark for Cubagua)’, as per Aldemaro Romero et al. in the article *Cubagua’s Pearl-Oyster Beds: The First Depletion of a Natural Resource Caused by Europeans in the American Continent.*

This shows that branding was used in my period of interest – but was it used by the English to show ownership?

If anyone has any information on this topic, or accounts of branding slaves for reasons other than punishment from 1650-1670, your help would be greatly appreciated. Historical documents/accounts would be fantastic, too. Thanks for reading through!"|ScaleySam|False|https://redd.it/eaodkd|4|0.55|0|1|1|history

It seems it has the natural prerequisites: land for growing crops, large animals for domestication, natural ores for metallurgy, has large areas of lands easily connected (i.e. not separated by mountain ranges or other such isolating terrain-- other than the Congo basin perhaps), and early presence of humans. They weren't even so isolated as to suffer from a lack of new ideas like civilizations in the Americas-- trade from Europe and Asia occurred at least as early as the Roman Empire.

He was instrumental in advancing chemistry into the modern age, but as he was involved in the Ferme générale, he was guillotined.

&#x200B;

However, the book says that Lavoisier and his (also scientific) wife ""...were making rather tardy plans to slip away to Scotland, Lavoisier was arrested"" (Bryson, 132). This was after Marie Antoinette had already been beheaded. The text also mentions that ""In May he and thirty-one fellow farmers-general were brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal...""(Bryson, 132). This would mean that many other nobles and such like had waited for a long time before attempting or planning to (or not even attempting or planning in some cases) escape.

&#x200B;

So my question is, why didn't more nobles and other targets of the reign of terror try to flee when they could or as early as possible? Was it arrogance, and they just thought that they were safe? Or was it fear, and the worry that if they escaped, they would be caught and executed?

In short, the story is set in a USA that lost World War II and got split between a Greater Nazi Reich in the east (with [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) as its regional capital), the Japanese Pacific States to the west (with [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) as the capital) and separated by a neutral zone that encompasses the [Rocky Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains).

On a similar note, since resistance movements have weapons such as firearms, what happens to all the civilian-owned firearms once the war is over?

This - along other presumptuous theories (e.g. Sir John Barrow's) - are product of the narrative fallacy more than anything, ~~like 95% of history's ""whys""~~, but fuck it.  
>  
>**Context:** For those unfamiliar here's the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutiny_on_the_Bounty) about the Bounty.

**1) Fletcher Christian had borrowed money from his Captain**. Bligh, comfortable being a purser, was very ""conservative"" in his finances. When with the Dutch after the mutiny, he forced his officers to grant him their will and power of attorney (in case of their death), as a guarantee for the money he lent them (""My shekels, sir!"").

Back then, a gentleman's word carried weight. Demaning such vexatory guarantee made one of his officers (theassistant surgeon) write home in outrage. It was also said by  the patriarch and mutineer John Adams that Blighwould remind Fletcher of his debt whenever they clashed.

**2) Bligh treated his officers as students.** It was good practice and expected of a senior officer to mentor their subordinates (specially midshipmen). However, Bligh may have been somewhat excessive in his ""lectures"".

When sailing with his nephew as 3rd Lieutenant and second in command, Bligh wrote home that he was a very happy with the nephew performance.  At the same time, the said nephew wrote home claiming his uncle was insufferable and impossible to take orders from. Know who said the exactly same thing? Fletcher Christian, his second in command on the Bounty, while being praised by his mentor.

**3) Absence of marines and commissioned officers on the voyage**. This one is self explanatory, poor Bligh didn't have a single courageous arm to lend a hand.

**4) The gentlemen on his ship didn't have a ""stake"" in their country**. Idiotic as this may sound now, the major guarantee of loyalty and diligence from the officers was their ""stake"" in the country - i.e. their financial and social interest in their success.

Not coincidentally, every gentlemen who partake in the mutiny was from a poor/disgraced family: Peter Heywood's father was a bankrupt and a embezzler, Fletcher Christian's was bankrupt and Ned Young was poor and a mixed race bastard.

**5) Tahitian Pussy.** According to the historian Ray Person, [lack of pussy is the root fucking cause of all global instability](https://youtu.be/OubHHtNM94s?t=64).

Seriously, now. Several officers were bewildered by the sexual liberty of Tahiti and, at the time of journey back, they were unwilling to go.

Personally the most interesting thing I've learnt is something personal which lead to a whole lot more about the man Rudolf Hess.

My grandad was put on duty whilst guarding Rudolf Hess (deputy fuhrer from 1933-1941) in Spandau, in the 60's and documented how he was just a solemn old man walking around the courtyard twice a day. I found this really interesting as my family don't really have cool stories like this and WW2 and the Nazi parties infrastructure was something I was interested in before knowing this.

Immediately I purchased three books about the man, one documenting his earlier life, another documenting his flight, and the final of which, which I have just finished, about a man of Jewish descent that was under Hess' protection from the Nuremberg Laws and Nazi discrimination.

Albrecht Haushofer was a diplomat and member of the German Resistance. It was interesting to learn how the Deputy Fuhrer's flight had many consequences for a family under his protection as the Nazi's disowned Hess. He was kept as a prisoner at Moabit Prison after being found hiding in a friend's farm by the narrowest of margins in December 1944. He was important for peace talks at the start of the war and Himmler kept him around for such purposes in case needed. Towards the ending of the war, as the Nazi's were getting desperate and the Allies were closing in around Berlin, they started releasing prisoners and sending them home.

The next part really shocked me and simply demonstrates the desperation and the cruelty of the Nazis.

As the allies were closing in on Berlin, Albrecht wrote multiple letters to his father, Karl Haushofer, as hope grew and chances of escape looked likely. On the night of the 22nd of April, he and multiple other prisoner were led out of the prison. They got all their clothes, valuables and money given back to them. They signed a document saying that they had been released and received their possessions. They were escorted out of the prison and then suddenly multiple SS officers surrounded them. All hope they may have had, was shattered in an instant as they were backed into a wall. Gunshots broke loose and all were executed, except one. One of the men were shot in the neck but miraculously survived. After being kicked by an SS officer who then said ""this pig is dead"". After this the SS left the crime scene and the event was documented by the sole survivor.

It was just something I found really interesting and shocking at the same time and I'd love to hear about your less known/favourite facts in history.

Use of this tactic in real life allowed the Romans to impose their language onto France and Iberia, and the effects of this are still seen today, with [Italian dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Dalmatian_languages), [French dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallo-Romance_languages) and [Iberian dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Romance_languages) [all being derived from Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages), and they all share a level of [mutual intelligibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility) to this day. Additionally, [Romanian dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_dialects) are also descended from Latin. In fact, as [*The Economist*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist) writes: ""[*Latin is dead—yet it also lives on*](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/06/06/latin-is-dead-yet-it-also-lives-on?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/latinisdeadyetitalsolivesonjohnson)"".

The Romans have had control of Greece and Carthage longer than they have controlled the area of modern-day France and modern-day Portugal. The Romans also controlled the area of modern-day Romania for less than 200 years. How come France, Iberia and Romania speak Latin-derived languages, while Greece, the Middle East and North Africa don't?

Also regarding the Roman Empire's linguistic legacy, the Balkans no longer speak Latin-derived languages because of the [Slavic migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavs#Migrations), while Austria, the Netherlands and England no longer speak Latin-derived languages because of the [Germanic migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_migration).

It makes me wonder if there were similar stuff back then such as horses blocking a gas pump, range anxiety on the first gasoline cars, and people hating cars because they believed myths about them or thought car owners were in some way inferior to horse owners or some other method of transportation.

Plus the recent PR stunt by Tesla regarding a rope pulling contest between a Ford and the Cybertruck has caused quite a bit of debate with many getting offended.

ea1t9x|2019-12-13 09:22:25|Did private enterprises exist in communist China?|"I'd like to start off by saying my undergraduate degree was in history. I later went back to school, and I am now getting my Master's in Accounting next spring. My understanding and grasp of the economy has increased tenfold, and it's also added a lot of complexity to the ideas I had of what I believed to be **communism** and **capitalism**. When we are children, we are given a very naive narration of history that paints one, more or less, as the ideology that is ""pro-markets"", and the other, ""pro-state"". Feel free to disagree with this designation, but understand that I am pointing out its clumsiness.

I have a hard time believing any society is strictly one or the other (market/state based, that is). But what I can't fully appreciate is how comprehensive the state acting as a replacement for a market economy in a country like, say 1950's communist China would have been. The one-sentence definition of communism is (again, feel free to disagree) a system in which the state owns everything. Intuitively, this can't be possible in any society which has a currency. Yes, you could argue the government **owns** the money, but this is a moot point; fiat currency backed by the full faith of the U.S. government doesn't make the bills they issue any less fungible in a market.

All capitalism is, from an accountant's perspective, is a system in which those with control of assets, or resources, or skills of any kind can exchange them for currency. Accounting is the tool by which one measures whether or not their cost of doing business, exceeds or subsides to, the profit arising from that business. Both the costs and the profit must be recorded in the same currency. If your costs exceed your profit, you are insolvent. But, if profit exceeds your costs, you are a capitalist. Essentially anyone who grows their wealth over time by having a positive equity balance (more assets than liabilities) and profit (revenue above and beyond the cost of doing business) was capitalist in nature.

I guess my real question here is, in communist China, what happened to these people? Who audited people or businesses to see if they were profiting off of something/someone? Couldn't you still become wealthy if you were good at exchanging things for currency? Were formal legal business entities not allowed? How did they collect taxes? Were there both sales and income taxes? What the hell was the economy really like?? I can't imagine a world in which a capitalist can't theorhetically practice capitalism. It now seems as if the more accurate descriptions of communism highlight its philosophy concerning free speech, rather than ownership."|200SelectionStereo|False|https://redd.it/ea1t9x|6|0.79|0|2|1|history

I just read more about this. I feel like it is a huge misunderstanding that many people say Japan was never colonized/conquered or resisted Western influence before the Meiji Restoration. 

From what I see, Tokugawa Japan was economically bankrupt and militarily weak in the 19th century. The US, British Empire, France, Netherland, and Russia simply walked into Japan, occupied certain strategic regions, did businesses with loyal locals and forced the Shogunate to sign unequal treaties. All of these are definitions of a protectorate like French Indochina or British Egypt except Japan was divided by those Western nations. Tokugawa Shogunate was on its last leg, while the invaders simply waited a moment to seize complete control over Japan. 

In the wiki article, it also addressed many Japanese intellectuals were deeply shameful of being dominated by foreigners, and this motivated a lot of them to conduct the Western study. It was fortunate that Choshu and Satsuma domains were Westernized enough to bring Meiji back to the Imperial throne. Who knows what will happen if they failed?

However in reality they were the people from Persia & their gods during the Vedic times who were referred to as Asuras (probably some of the most good looking people).It was a case of showing. According to some genealogy studies & writings, Kashyap Rishi during the Vedic & the Avestan people (Persian) shared a common ancestry from the Rishi himself.

Like in any family after a period of time the progeny settled in different parts of the land & started to progress from there on. Infact in the early part of Vedas many Vedic Gods were referred as Asuras including Indra who is one of the most important of them all in the Rig Veda. So in essence intially the relations were harmonious and word Asura was used as a mark of respect & honour. However later on conflict between the two increased over generations & this ultimately led to a big war of Dasarjana or in other words called ""The Battle of Ten Kings"", post this war which the Vedic tribes under the leadership of ""Sudas"" won decisively thereby firmly establishing the Vedic Kingdom in the what was then known as the Brahmavarta region (region between the now dried up Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers) led to continued hostilities  between the two tribes that really never ceased conclusively atleast till the end of the Vedic period. It was in this context then that the word Asura was started to be used in a negative connotation.

The origin of the word Deva is less clearer as there are few cases behind its etymology that has to be studied in more detail. However according to an old mythological story of Samudramanthan (don’t know its exact underlying historic background from where this very popular mythological story emerged) . This was a contest between the Devas & Asura to churn the ocean and retrieve a nector that would give them eternal life.

The Vedic people in form of their deities ""The Devas""  were able to get their hands on the nector which was then called Sura (was a drink & probably could have been alcohalic in nature) while the Avestans were unable to do so & hence they were called A-sura i.e. people without the nectar of life.

As was the case with Sapta Sindhu (term given in the Rig Veda by the Vedic people themselves to the region of their influence) where in Iranian pronounciation of that time it was called Hapta Hindu i.e. ""S"" being replaced by ""H"", similarly the Persians referred to their respected ones as Ahura again ""S"" being replaced by ""H"" & later on when Zoroastrianism was firmly established their highest deity as ""Ahura Mazda"".

Hence as the Vedic people used to look down upon the Avestan or Persian people as historic mortal enemies & use the word Asura in a negative sense in the same vain the Persians used to look down upon the Vedic people & many of their deities who the Vedic people called as Devas. Hence ""Asura"" in the Vedic culture especially after the war became a pejorative or negative term in the same way ""Deva"" in the Persian or Avestan culture became a pejorative or negative term as it happens in any conflict where both sides try to show the other in poor light.

Also one interesting trivia out of this whole episode is the case that as in the case of ""Sapta Sindhu"" which the Persians pronounced as ""Hapta Hindu"" & from there used to refer to the people of this area as Hindu & the country as Hind, the europeans adopted the term as pronounced or mispronouncced it as Ind/Indie & from there came the name of the nation state of Bharata as ""India"". Similarly since the Persians used to use the word ""Deva""  to describe Vedic deities in a negative sense the Europeans again adopted it and from there came the modern word of ""Devil""!!!

e8iilq|2019-12-10 00:10:08|Are there any examples of well attested and complete dead religions that at some point had any significant following?|"I've been reading up on different religions quite a lot but something that I noticed is that many dead religions like Manichaeism aren't really that well understood with much of it being speculation.

What I'm really looking for are religions that would be well understood enough that it could theoretically be revived today, meaning that we have a well enough understanding of the religions beliefs and practices to understand how it would have been practiced day-to-day.

With significant following I mean like something that would have been a major religion in an area, not like a short lived small new age movement that popped up and died in a short time."|Suedie|False|https://redd.it/e8iilq|3340|0.95|0|1014|1|history

I really want to read real facts, information and stuff about this age. The traditions, the widely known names, the countries that used to be the largest and most powerful and so on.

e973gq|2019-12-11 13:27:49|Where to Find Nazi Rally Speeches with Subtitles?|"I was wondering if anyone knows where I might be able to find Nazi speeches (Hitler, Goebbels particularly) with subtitles in their entirety. It fascinates me how the Nazi party took over and turned ordinary people into murderers, and I'd be interested to see the Nazi Party as they saw it from their homes/ at the rallies. They seem to have been removed from youtube (which I understand) and in all honesty I don't really know where else to look. They can of course be found in documentaries but they're only very short extracts.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

e8zori|2019-12-11 00:52:14|Who was it that actually burnt down the library of Alexandria?|One view that goes back to Edward Gibbon was that Christian mobs during the Christianization of the Roman Empire burnt down the library. But that has been disputed by modern historians who point to the fact that the actions of those mobs didn't burn down any libraries, but took down pagan statues under the decree of the emperor Theodosius. Others point to Julius Caesar as the culprit while still others point to even the Arab conquest. Which narrative would be true?|Anglicanpolitics123|False|https://redd.it/e8zori|25|0.78|0|13|1|history

As the title already suggests, I'm looking for a good book on the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, preferably a book that also covers what led up to the signing of the treaty and the peace negotiations itself.

e935bp|2019-12-11 06:00:55|Why did the Jewish resistance fighters in Masada commit mass suicide instead of fighting to the last man? And how did this Jewish war compare to other rebellions against Rome?|"I am fascinated by this story. At the culmination of the Roman-Jewish war, several hundred Jews who had taken a position in Masada heights resisted the Romans for some time. When the Romans built an earthen ramp and reached their defenses, they committed suicide.

Now, I am neither a military nor a Jewish historian. What I am wondering is that was there a scenario in which these brave fighters could have fought to the last man standing instead of committing suicide? The latter is a sin in Judaism, right? A related question is, would we categorize those fighters on nationalist or religious terms?

Final question is, as far as rebellions against Rome go, was this one of the more significant ones in Roman history. I know that Judea killed off one whole Roman legion before Rome took revenge. Was such victory, at least initial victory, achieved by other Roman subjects. I think the Germans wiped out one or two Roman legions. By the way, in the Forum in Rome, I've seen an arch that celebrates Rome's victory in its war with Jewish people. So it was a big deal for Rome.

Finally, a book just came out that reviews all of this: ""Josephus 'The Jewish War', by Martin Goodman."|aaHBN|False|https://redd.it/e935bp|7|0.82|0|12|1|history
