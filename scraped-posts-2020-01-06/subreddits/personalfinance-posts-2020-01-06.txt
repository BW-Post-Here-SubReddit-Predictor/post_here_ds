ektxr0|2020-01-06 13:08:30|30-Day Challenge #1: Get on top of your credit (January, 2020)|"# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to announce that we're continuing our 30-day challenge series. The schedule spans the entire year so be sure to keep an eye out each month.

This month's 30-day challenge is to **get on top of your credit.** Here are some concrete steps you can take:

# Check your free credit report

There are three major credit bureaus in the US: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. These companies each gather credit histories for individuals and sell that information to credit card companies, lenders, and other financial institutions.

You can go to https://www.annualcreditreport.com to get a credit report from each credit bureau once per year. It's often recommended to stagger your requests so you can get one every four months so you may only want to request one report at this time. You can use a calendar reminder to stay on top of this.

Now, your free credit report won't include your score and it also won't include credit monitoring, but you absolutely don't need to buy those from a credit bureau because there are free options. See below.

Note that the security questions will sometimes ask about intentionally false information (e.g. made-up loans), so ""none of the above"" may be the right answer. If you can't get past the security questions, you may have to write in to get your report. Also be aware that you don't have to pay for anything on the credit bureau sites. If you find yourself prompted for a credit card number, you might have clicked to sign up for something you might not need or want.

Also, if you have trouble with the web site, try temporarily disabling browser ad-blockers and privacy extensions.

See the [Credit Reports Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_reports) for more information!

# Sign up for free credit monitoring

You don't need to pay for credit monitoring. Some options:

* A variety of companies such as [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/) and [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) offer free credit monitoring services. [There's a longer list of options in our Wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico#wiki_how_can_i_get_my_fico_score_or_a_score_estimate_for_free.3F)

* Many employers also offer free credit monitoring for their employees directly with a credit bureau. Check with your benefits department.

* Finally, if you've been the victim of a data breach like Target or Anthem, those companies are providing free credit monitoring for anyone potentially affected.

After exploring your options, sign up with at least one of them. More information contained in the [Credit Scoring Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico).

# Find out your credit score

You can now [get your FICO score for free from Discover](https://www.creditscorecard.com/) without a credit card.

In addition, a number of credit cards actually give you a free FICO score as a benefit of having their card. Brands providing FICO scores include Discover, Citi (branded cards only), American Express, Bank of America, and Barclaycard. [Here's a full list of options.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico#wiki_how_can_i_get_my_fico_score_or_a_score_estimate_for_free.3F)

In addition, you can get your VantageScore from [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/) or [Mint](https://www.mint.com/). VantageScore is used less often by creditors than FICO, but it's a *usually* a good estimate of your FICO score. Paying for your credit score is silly unless you're considering getting a major loan like a mortgage.

# Get rid of pre-approved credit card junk mail

[OptOutPrescreen.Com](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/) is the official consumer credit card reporting website to opt-out of offers of credit or insurance. It's an easy win to reduce junk mail and reduce the risk of identity theft (from someone stealing your mail). I recommend signing up unless you're in the process of building credit and actually want to receive pre-approved offers.

# Are you looking to improve your credit?

Once you have a score over 740, most credit files are solid enough to qualify for prime rate lending. This means that any additional increase of your score will likely not get you better credit products.

If you are in a position where you'd like to improve your credit, here are two situations that often befall people when asking for help here:

* [""I have no credit, and I am looking to get started.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building#wiki_i_have_no_credit.2C_and_i_am_looking_to_get_started.)
* [""I have bad credit, and I am looking to repair it.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building#wiki_i_have_bad_credit.2C_and_i_am_looking_to_repair_it.)

# What to do if you find information you don't recognize

Even though credit reporting is automated, mistakes can still occur. The most common errors can involve names and addresses. If your name is similar to a parent's name, there are also instances where a line of credit is reported on the wrong file.

The simplest course of action is to dispute the information with the bureaus. Here are direct links to initiate a dispute:

* [Equifax](https://experian.referral.equifax.com/CreditInvestigation/home.action)
* [Experian](http://www.experian.com/disputes/main.html)
* [TransUnion](https://onlinedispute.transunion.com/disputewizard/)

Finally, if you believe you've had your identity stolen, read and follow the steps in our **[Identity Theft Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft)**.

# If you're not in the United States

[The PF wiki has many more countries covered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_reports#wiki_what_if_i.27m_not_in_the_united_states.3F) If you would like to add information for your country to the wiki, please message the moderation team.

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 3 or more of the following things:

* Requested a free credit report via annualcreditreport.com

* Found out your credit score (either FICO or VantageScore)
* Signed up for free credit monitoring

I got divorced a few years ago and I've put it off long enough to sell the engagement ring that she gave back to me. The ring costed me $5,500 and from my understanding, if I sell it back anywhere they'd only give me the material price of the ring and I'd get only around $500 at most.

I’ve had these teens for almost 2 years, and I’d like to help them get checking accounts set up. Their mom still has some rights as of now (state has filed for permanent custody, but it’s a process that’s going to take probably another year)... can I help them set up checking accounts that their biological mom can’t access?
I know I could probably set up another checking account in my own name and just give them access; but, at least when I was a teen, student checking accounts were free without all the direct deposit requirements

ekx07f|2020-01-06 17:13:20|Got new job. Current boss asked me to stay longer than 2 weeks. Now that has elapsed and he is asking for another 1-2 months.|"So I've been at my current job just over 4 years and had been feeling less than enthusiastic about the day to day. Having my resume posted online resulted in a job offer from a bigger company (current job is extremely small - 4 employees not counting owner) with better benefits (current benefits are not much to write home about).

New job wanted me to start 12/30 and when I gave my two weeks to my boss (who has treated me great this whole time) he asked if I could give him two more. The new job agreed to push back my start date.

That start date is a week from today and last Friday the boss asked me about possibly staying on another month or two while he finishes up some other business matters. He alluded to ""making sure I'm taken care of"" - possibly some off the books late Christmas bonus type deal? Along with helping out with getting another job assuming the one I've been hired at doesn't gel with me extending my start date another 30-60 days.

Looking for advice as I weigh my options. I could use the ""bonus"" to pay off some credit card debt and the last $1000 of my car note in theory. Not sure if that is worth losing this other opportunity over (stable job, similar industry, cushy corporation, voted one of the best workplaces in my city multiple years) even though I would be taking a slight pay cut to start (losing a little over $3/hr taking the new job).

Appreciate any advice in advance!"|sensoryimpressions|False|https://redd.it/ekx07f|83|0.86|0|100|1|personalfinance

Sounds like this is completely doable, and in a number of ways, but the general consensus is that I should NOT do this.  Very valid points have been made, and I think I will just keep my mouth shut about things. 

ORIGINAL POST:

My parents are getting older and will obviously pass away at some point.

I know that they will have well over $1M by the time they pass just due to the growth of the retirement accounts they currently have. 

I'm am financially independent and will likely retire early. My 2 siblings are in a very different boat.

Splitting my parents estate 50/50 between my 2 siblings will absolutely change their lives.

Am I able to just decline my 1/3 share so that it gets split 50/50?

EDIT 1: I have discussed this with my parents already, and they refuse to change their existing will, which specifies an even 33.3% spilt. They see the 50% as unfair to me, even though I am the one that is requesting it."|nviousguy|False|https://redd.it/ekuwjg|119|0.9|0|103|1|personalfinance
eklnpn|2020-01-06 00:20:08|My brother suddenly became unable to work and has no income. My parents are stressed trying to support him.|"Hey all, so my parents are in a tough spot right now and I have no clue how to help them. First, my adult older brother is 38 and for 14 years had a fantastic job which he loved. Unfortunately, he’s ran into some major health problems lately - first, he’s had type 1 diabetes for a while now, and recently a tick bite gave him both Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. He also has a number of other ailments that I’m not sure about, but basically he has a number of bacterial infections and is in bad shape. His body is not reacting well and at one point he had a severe reaction that left him in the intensive care unit for several days where he was apparently close to dying. 

Ever since then, he’s never been exactly right. His main problem is he is extremely lethargic — to the point he can’t even get up in the morning on some days. Some days he’s okay, others not. He’s not consistent enough with his energy levels to be able to work. He’s regularly seeing doctors — none of them have been able to resolve this. He took disability leave through his company since he was so weak. He was able to support himself through this, but unfortunately, they ran out and he has zero savings. So right how, he has absolutely no income whatsoever. He is trying to get better, but so far barely any progress has been made so I'm afraid the end is nowhere in sight.

He went sobbing to my parents and they felt very sorry for him and agreed to help. But I don’t think they realized what they were getting into. They are both retired, and they are handling ALL of his expenses and bills - and I mean everything — including his mortgage, car payment, medical, groceries, insurance, phone, etc. literally anything and everything he has to pay for, they are covering. He has absolutely ZERO income coming in and nothing saved. But my parents are using more of their income on him than they are comfortable doing. It’s probably no more than three or four days before he is asking for more.

He has cut all expenses other than the necessities. He has no cable, internet, no other subscriptions of any kind. He explained the situation to his mortgage and they agreed to let him defer some payments for now. And he does have a health plan through the Marketplace but it doesn’t cover everything he is on. He says he can’t file for unemployment because he is not actively seeking a job as his body cannot handle working right now. He did apply for some kind of help through social security that he is waiting to hear back on. And I believe he does plan to sell his house and temporarily stay with my parents until he recovers, but I don’t think that’s going to help the matter much. Sure, the house expenses will be removed, but he still has a ton of other things, plus it could take many months to sell.

This has been going on for 4 months now and my parents came to me saying they are stressed and have no idea how to handle this other than to keep supporting him. They feel like they have no choice as he will either starve or won’t have the money to get his medicine and he will get worse. I told them none of this is their fault and my brother shouldn't have left his job without having any savings, but then again he had a major medical emergency that nearly killed him and he is still trying to recover from. So maybe I am being harsh. It just kills me to see my parents so stressed for something they had zero involvement with and that isn’t their fault whatsoever. It’s to the point that even seeing a text or a missed phone call from him gives them huge anxiety over what he will need next and how that will impact their situation. Im just hoping there is a better way to handle what is going on."|HorkBajirX|False|https://redd.it/eklnpn|708|0.92|0|188|1|personalfinance

ekxdfk|2020-01-06 17:40:03|Spent 2019 realizing I'm a grownup and my finances should probably start acting that way! Here's my 2019 year in review! Looking for advice on improving and happy to help others!|"So off the top - my wife and I are in a really fortunate position income wise.  We're in our mid-30s and live very comfortable lives largely because of our hard work in our 20s.  Combined we earned about $240k gross in 2019.  I know that puts me on the top of the higher end of the income spectrum.  I've been climbing the income ladder for a few years without making many strategic moves to set us up for the future - that changed in 2019.

Before I get to the long winded stuff about what we did in 2019 here are some charts and tables!

[2019 Sankey Chart - Income/Expenses](https://imgur.com/a/aZqt7rn)

[2018 Sankey Chart - Income/Expenses (one that made me realize I need to get smarter)](https://imgur.com/r934oOH)

[Table Comparing 2019 vs 2018 Income/Expenses](https://imgur.com/a/fPGuq40)

[Net Worth - 2019 vs 2018](https://imgur.com/a/bYsE1AF)

**Changes Made In 2019**

1. Started using 401ks to the max allowable (changed later in the year so it isn't 100% of the max)
   1. As a result we saved $32k which shielded $19k more from income tax than it did in 2018.  
   2. Income rose $20k in 2019 but payroll taxes stayed flat!
2. Paid off car loans without buying new cars.
   1. We've had a goal for a few years to save for a vacation house.  Pulled about $10k out of there to pay off our car loans.  Know that this didn't really save us much in interest expense as our notes were both around 1.5% but it frees up a bunch of cash monthly and the psychological burden is lifted!
3. Child 1 went to Kindergarten and left daycare.
   1. That's huge as it saves us about $12k/year!
4. Really stepped back and looked at our spending habits - part of this was realizing we're in a position where we don't need to worry about ""making it"" anymore.  We need to start thinking smart instead of hard.  To that end we actually started spending more on things that either bought us time, aided in our health, or protected our assets.
   1. Didn't even consider canning the cleaning lady - she saves us so much time.
   2. We've had a landscaper do some projects in the past - now he does everything around our home.  I get to spend the whole weekend with my wife/kids.  
   3. Use services such as HelloFresh or Blue Apron.
      1. I get it that those are expensive but it buys us time, allows us to try new foods, and is healthier than eating junk when the kids are in bed.
   4. Reviewed our home and auto policies - we were way under insured in almost all areas.
   5. Bought life insurance policies for both of us.
      1. If either of us kick the bucket in the next 30 years the other will be able to still reach our shared goals of putting the kids through college and remaining in our home.  $1.5m for me since I'm the primary earner and $500k for her.

**Changes to Net Worth**

1. Biggest change was that our net worth increased 27% largely due to two factors
   1. Tax deferred retirement assets increase $120k/45%
      1. About $32k of that was contributions and the other $88k was due to a friendly stock market.
   2. Eliminated all non-mortgage debt by paying off our car loans
      1. Mortgage is a 3.5% so I see no incentive to pay that off any time soon.

So to wrap this up I'd like pointers from anyone in this community - what can I do better in 2020?  Is there anything people would like to learn about the strategies we took to get from A to B?

**tl;dr:** we looked at our financial life at the end of 2018 and realized we needed to grow up - here's the results of spending 2019 growing up.  What can I do better?"|RedditingOnTheToilet|False|https://redd.it/ekxdfk|19|0.84|0|7|1|personalfinance
ekxvcs|2020-01-06 18:15:50|Mortgage Broker Stopped Replying After A Hiccup With Financing....|"I don’t know if this is where to post this, but I need some advice if anyone knows about this!

So I’m 26/F in the midst of trying to buy a house with my dad and we’re doing this privately without a real estate agent as my dad has a friend who is trying to unload a couple investment properties. This has actually been going well, it’s definitely more difficult without the guidance of an agent, as I’m a first time buyer, but the people we’re working with have been amazing.

So the pickle, we were at the very last steps of financing through this brokerage and getting the final papers to sign when she mentioned that the lender would be calling my job 2 weeks prior to the closing date to confirm my employment there..... now when we first wrote up our mortgage application I put down my full time employer and everything would have been good, but literally 2 weeks after I got a job offer (that I had applied to months ago) for a career in my field which I gladly accepted and was excited about. I didn’t consider this as affecting anything with financing and thought it might even help out more as I get paid like $10000 more now. 

But when our broker brought up the employment during a meeting, I had mentioned to her what had happened with my new job, again not even thinking this would be a big deal as I make more $$ now, and she freaked out, my dad told me afterward she called him on the phone angry and told him he was a liar. Since then we had spoke and it seemed like it would be fine they would just explain to the lender what happened, but now it’s like radio silence. They haven’t responded to any emails, they haven’t called etc. 

What do you think is up? Was what happened really that bad? It was completely innocent....my career finally is taking off, I guess just at a bad time?

Should we just move on and try to find another broker/lender? Any suggestions or opinions would be amazing."|Mindsey|False|https://redd.it/ekxvcs|9|1.0|0|13|1|personalfinance
ekuayc|2020-01-06 13:42:58|What to do with dad's check each month?|"My dad experienced some health issues and was forced to retire. He worked as corrections officer and has a pension each month in the amount of around $3500. He is currently covered by health insurance through my mom, he will be 64 this July. 

The pension is enough to pay his bills and their house is paid off. It's a tiny 800sq ft house, and the property taxes are only like $1k a year. Utilities are minimal, as the house is small and pretty well insulated. He started getting $1500 a month in social security as soon as he was eligible. He does not ""need"" this money and it gets deposited into an account and he does not touch it. So far the account has around 40k in it.

 He does have a 403b with another 40k. And a few other accounts with like an additional 10k in them. But that is all my parents have to get them through retirement. 

The one kicker is that my dad may need to buy a new truck soon, as his 2000 Chevy is starting to rust. He ""needs"" a truck, as hunting is his main hobby and a deer or a bear won't fit in a Civic. So he could be taking on a $500-$600 car payment, or perhaps no payment if he drains his savings account to pay cash. He lives a very simple life and rarely buys things unless he needs them, hunting, fishing, and a small camping trailer are his modest splurges. 

My mom will be 62 soon and she is also looking to retire, if they can figure out health insurance. She has no money saved for retirement and as a church employee for over 40 years her salary is low, so her social security will be around $1200 a month. The one benefit, is that she thinks she can get health insurance for both her and my dad from her employer upon her retirement for around $500 a month until they are eligible for Medicare. 

So my question here... should dad keep putting his $1500 a month into his savings account, or is there something else he should be doing with this money each month?"|bitterbeerfaces|False|https://redd.it/ekuayc|16|0.81|0|32|1|personalfinance

ekyive|2020-01-06 19:02:12|I Just Found Out I Have an Irrevocable Trust - Questions|"Hi Reddit,

I recently have been made aware that I am a trustee of an irrevocable trust. Neither my father or mother will clarify the terms, amount, or generally speak about it. I'm not even sure what an irrevocable trust is, and honestly the google results are kind of confusing. I was wondering if anyone has any professional experience dealing with this, and if the below is unusual? Are there next steps? I'm entering my 30s and I find it really strange that these things are being kept from me, but money has been a very \*taboo\* topic in my family since growing up. Is it possible to request the terms of this trust discreetly? 

A little backstory -- my grandfather was particularly successful businessman and started multiple companies before 'retiring' as a consultant in his field. His 4 children have lived pretty comfortable lives, all while having very blue-collar careers in our small town - and one of them never working. I never connected the dots until I was older, but I am aware that my father, as well as his three sisters have trust funds that allow them to live an ""upper middle class lifestyle"" as well as pay for their kids to attend private schools and college, etc. 

Fast forward -- I'm home for thanksgiving and my father asks me to sign paperwork from an 'irrevocable trust.' The paperwork basically said that a contribution of XXX,XXX amount of dollars had been made to the trust and that I was entitled to a portion of that should I make a written claim. There were duplicate copies of this paperwork for all my siblings, as well as my father who was eligible for a larger monetary claim. I asked my Father why I am just now seeing this, and he said that he had been signing my name my entire life, and was very obtuse and skittish about what this meant, and if the trust had rules, and so on. In fact, everyone has been really shady throughout my life when I ask 'how' our family has afforded things, etc. 

Also I am aware that my grandfather paid for my own college education, and have been told, vaguely, by one of my aunts that a trust fund exists to pay specifically for the educational needs for children of the family. Would this be a separate 'Trust' from the one I had been asked to sign?"|mynameiscraigg|False|https://redd.it/ekyive|5|1.0|0|8|1|personalfinance

ekqmmi|2020-01-06 07:21:14|Friend Asked me to be a Guarantor - I agreed and I'm regretting my decision. What options do I have (if any)?|"Hi,

I want to start off by saying that I'm aware I should have been more careful. I am partly responsible for the situation I am in but there were some factors I was unaware of. Though, I am unsure if these would help my case... 

So a year back, they came to me for help. They gave me a sob story (their parent ruined their credit rating and they were being charged for a phone bill (plus interest) that they thought they had resolved) and because they were a long time friend I decided (albeit begrudgingly) to help them. I thought it would be good for their credit rating and naively assumed that they would be grateful enough to be responsible with their repayments. I agreed to not tell anyone, which they assured me was because of embarrassment. 

Now, I have made one repayment on their behalf. They told me that they had the money but it had been rejected for some reason. I told them I'd pay it but I need the money back. Two weeks later and after multiple ""I'll get it to you today."" I still haven't received it back. I was prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt... But then New Years Eve comes round and I casually mention to a mutual friend that the borrower owes me money to which I get the response ""They owe me money, I am a guarantor on a loan for them.""

They have a £10,000 loan with my mutual friend.

A £5,000 loan with me.

I no longer wish to be friends with the burrower. Their bad credit rating is due to being in major debt with pay day loan companies and I am very concerned about this recent development. If I had known about the other loan, I would never have agreed to help. They've lied to me and keep making excuses. 

I am able to pay the loan payments and I know I'm legally obligated so I will *if* I have to. Needless to say, I am never being a guarantor again. Are there any other options open to me (besides declaring bankruptcy)? 

I'm UK based if it helps.

So my father passed away unexpectedly last week and I am trying to figure out what to do with my parent's mortgage payments. My father and mother were both on the mortgage, but now that he has passed it will be solely in my mother's name.

I currently live in an apartment with a roommate and pay about $950 a month. My mother cannot afford the payments, so it would fall on me.

ekvem5|2020-01-06 15:15:27|Should we radically sell our house and grind through 2020?|"My wife just called me with a radical idea to reset our finances and build our personal wealth. I am excited about the idea and I can't think of too many downsides, so I wanted some other thoughts.

We are a young family with two toddlers. We bought our house when our second was born because our rental was too small and rents for anything bigger were more than a mortgage. We used a low down payment mortgage program because we didn't have the savings we wanted.

My wife works part time around the kids schedules and I have a good paying job, but our benefits are bad so we have some medical debt and small credit card debt along with our student loans. We have enough to make things work and save a little, but we can't seem to get ahead on our 5 year plan of our emergency fund + CC/medical debt + 20% down payment for a house that fits our family/location.

So, my wife's idea is to radically sell our house in the next 60 days. The market is in our favor and with our bit of equity we should be able to turn a 10-15k profit. Then we would move in with my parents for 6 months. During that 6 months we would eliminate most of our bills and be able to save significantly while paying down the smaller of our debts. Then, in the summer we find a new house, taking our time, not having to sell a house and with a proper down payment without debt and a fresh focus on our finances.

Since the kids are not in school yet the only things affected by the sudden move would be commutes, which is minor. Tell me why I shouldn't suddenly move out and get my house ready to sell right now!

&#x200B;

\*\*Edit to answer some questions\*\*

Yes, step one is to budget this all out. I appreciate everyone pointing out the real estate agent fees/commissions. We have a great relationship with the agent who helped us by the house who we would use to sell. I would definitely have a discussion about what that number should be (thanks for the suggestion). Anyone have a good template for calculating the net on a home sale?

We currently can pay off our debt, slowly. This would be a radical change in effort to speed up the process while we see an opportunity. The other piece of this that I didn't explain well is that we have been looking at the possibility of moving anyway. We know we need to make changes to the budget as is, but this would be the jump start to the process in an effort to get us to the position of making that move more quickly.

And of course this is all contingent on my parents.  In order for us to move forward they would need to be excited, not just ok with it. Of course we would not be asking to live for free, I would fully expect a rent, etc.

More info in post.|"So I’ve been given an incredible gift and my student loans are about to be wiped out. That’s the only debt I have, except for $1300 on a credit card which I paid off last month. My credit score isn’t great but  not so awful- I’ve been really building over the past few years, it’s probably about 600-620. As it’s been getting better I’ve been getting a lot of offers for auto financing from Capital One- which is not my bank but my credit card company. I’ve seen reviews for auto financing from my bank (TD) are mostly not great. I’ve been warned against cc auto financing but it looks like the average rate is about 6%. Definitely not awesome but with my credit score I wasn’t expecting better. Or should I?

I really need a new car, my 20 year old Jeep is not cutting it anymore. My main question is- once I get this loan paid off- which should happen by the 31st, can I expect to see my credit score go up? And therefore should I wait for that to happen before shopping for a car? 

And if you’re feeling generous, Reddit- I’ve (30f) never bought a car from a dealer before and would take any advice you’ve got. I’ll probably have to shop alone- I’ve been told not to do that as a woman and that I could get taken advantage of price-wise (which is shitty to hear) but it’s my only option. I’ve done some research but if you’ve got any tips for me I’d appreciate it. Looking for prob another Jeep- something like a 15-17 Patriot with less than 30k mi. I’d like to pay less than $300/mo which from what I’ve seen, should be doable. 
If I get financed through capital one they just show me all the cars that are available near me with the rate I would get already agreed upon by the dealer (supposedly). So unless I get advice that that’s a horrible way to go- I think it’s a good strategy for me to be able to really shop around with out getting manipulated by dealers- which I so would, I’m so naive and such an easy target.

I'm making about $60k and my monthly loan payments are about 30% of my paycheck. I owe about $100k. 

I have about $80k in private and $20k in federal loans. I've paid ~$11k on the private, with $4k of that being principal and the rest interest. I've paid the minimums on federals. 

I'm a bit frustrated with how I feel like I'm not making much progress since I'm paying so much interest right now. My highest rates are 8% and I've been using the debt snowball method to attack these high rate private loans. 

I've even been working a small side job to increase my income by a couple hundred dollars each month. I've been living with my parents to build up an emergency fund but am hoping to soon move out for more privacy and independence. 

Is there anything else I should be considering to help me pay the loans off faster or slightly reduce my monthly payments to help with moving out?

1) Is refinancing a good idea for me to get better rates? I may be able to have a parent cosign. If this is a good idea, where do I even begin to choose who to refinance with? 

2) Do crowd funding sites ever help? 

3) Is moving out right now a really bad idea? I'm expecting about $500 for rent each month plus utilities since I'd live with my boyfriend. 

Other thoughts? Basically want to know if I'm on the right track or if I can be doing something more at this point to be in a better position. My parents don't seem to have much advice for me on this and they're too busy to help me research and discuss this."|coxswain_43|False|https://redd.it/ekx9i7|2|1.0|0|4|1|personalfinance

ekwrxi|2020-01-06 16:57:48|Sister (34) no retirement savings. How can I best set her up?|"My sister went through a divorce a year ago (where he managed all financial things) so she is basically starting over from nothing. She earns about $60k/annually and has $40k in a regular savings account. She is financially illiterate and knows she is behind but just doesn’t know how to start. My financial situation is different from hers so I’m using what I know to get her started. Any input would be welcomed.

401k: She was never previously eligible for 401k but just became eligible and is starting at 10% contribution with small employer match. She doesn’t know who the 401k provider is but will find out this week. I believe it’s a very small company so I’m expecting the ER’s to be high. She is currently putting money into the ‘default’ investment but is going to get a list of fund choices we can look through to choose what’s best. We are going to look into her budget to see if she can contribute more (15%). 

IRA: Open and fund $12k to a Fidelity Roth IRA ($6k for 2019 and $6k for 2020) into FIPFX (2050 index fund). I know they have zero-fee funds but she’s just going to want something she can invest in and forget about it; she isn’t going to want to do any rebalancing. Maybe in a year or two I can move her to the no-fee funds when she gets more comfortable.

**Is a Roth the right type for her or should she be putting into traditional?  I think she would still be eligible for the tax deduction given her income if she went with traditional but I truly don’t know what’s best for her situation. Any advice on this?**

E-fund: After she moves over $12k to IRA, this would leave her a nice E-fund of $28k. She opened a HYSA and is moving $25k to that with some of it going into a CD. This leaves her with $3k at a local bank.

She knows to start saving for 2021 IRA. Depending on what the 401k funds/ERs are, she may end up reducing 401k contributions (to get only the match) and instead fund the IRA starting in 2021.

Any input would be welcomed; it’s easier to manage your own PF than someone else’s."|PracticalEmployee|False|https://redd.it/ekwrxi|2|0.75|0|4|1|personalfinance

ekqh6f|2020-01-06 07:05:52|The new 2020 irs w4 form and calculator.|"Three gripes.
* The form no longer allows you to manually specify your withholding.
* The calculator tells me the incorrect withholding amount I need per paycheck compared to their own totals and my own math. It's nearly 2x too high. 
* The calculator offers a pre-filled out w4 form to download but it was empty for me (at least on android). 

I have two unique things I deal with
1) half of my compensation is in a bonus which my employer already does withholding on
2) my spouses employer has garbage payroll so it's very difficult to adjust the w4

To work around #2 I just set up spouse w4 as zero withholding, mine covers us both. Then for mine I just use the estimated total tax owed, subtract out the withholding I know is coming on my bonus (#1) then divide by the # of paychecks I get and that's my withholding. Voila. 

No way to do this now? Am I missing something? 

I guess for the spouse I can just claim exempt to get nothing withheld. No idea what to do for my form.

Calculator for reference 
https://apps.irs.gov/app/tax-withholding-estimator/


Edit:
* the calculator is indeed busted for its per paycheck numbers
* if you set 4b crazy high (like $999999) then you can set whatever withholding you want on 4c

ekyzrz|2020-01-06 19:35:32|Recently married. Spouse has $77k in student/car loans. Should I pay them off?|"Youngish newlyweds - 35 & 27. Spouse is $76,959.65 in debt. I always see great advise from r/personalfinance and now it's my turn to ask.

Currently on a $1000 a month payment plan. 

Student Loan 1- 
$37,118.88
7.210% Interest
$390 payment per month

Student Loan 2-
$7,156.85
3.862% Interest
$50 payment per month

Student Loan 3-
$19,994.25
6.210% Interest
$160 payment per month

Car Loan-
$12,689.67
3.09% Interest
$400 a month payments

Current pay plan only includes spouses income. Our combined income is about $100k after taxes. 

I have $60k in savings working towards buying a house. $10k emergency fund. I max out my Roth IRA and contribute 10%(3% match) into my 401k. I am debt free with a newish vehicle. Spouse has not started down the retirement path. We currently live rent free (long story) and probably will for a few more years. Especially if I dump my savings. Other expenses are budgeted and I believe negligible for this exercise. 

Unbury.me is a fabulous tool that shows the straight dollars of spouse's current pay plan. Numbers indicate it would be paid off by 2028, but with over $20k in interest paid. The balance exceeds my funds, but we can scratch off the two higher interest student loans. Increasing our pay plan to $1500 a month, we would be debt free in a year with only $390 interest paid.

I feel like I have given this plenty of thought, but I am looking for outside insight that I may have not considered.

*Bonus Question* - Our living situation is rather unique, but can change at any time. It has not changed in 5 years and we do not expect it to, but it surely could. I was told with home loan interest rates being what they are; it is better to borrow than to put down a large down payment. I'd always have the $10k emergency fund for a down payment. Opinions? 

Lastly, let's pretend trust isn't an issue. This isn't relationship advise. In my heart of hearts I can't imagine spouse saying ""kthanksbye"". This is not their idea. Spouse doesn't even know I am contemplating this. Spouse budgets, is paying debt aggressively and is far more responsible with money than I am."|losingfocus1337|False|https://redd.it/ekyzrz|1|1.0|0|0|1|personalfinance
ekyz7p|2020-01-06 19:34:29|21 looking for advice on whether to buy property as soon as possible or wait|"Hi all, I have a few questions concerning my living situation for the next year or so. I am 21, living in NH, and looking to finally move out of my parents' house within a month or two. 

One option I have is to rent a small apartment with a close friend for a year, at about $650/month each including utilities. This could be even cheaper if my girlfriend also decides to live there permanently. After a year's time, the plan would then be to buy a cheap 3 or 4 bedroom house to fix up, build equity in, and rent out to friends. 

The other option is to basically bypass the apartment and start looking for a house immediately. My main question is: is it worth diving into property ownership a little earlier than I'm completely comfortable with in order to save paying a years worth of rent? 

If so, what are the chances I'm able to secure a ~$150-$200k loan for a fair rate at my current age? Furthermore, how much should I reasonably have saved in order to do this without failing? I know I will need between 10-20% for a down payment, probably closer to 20%. Would I even be considered for a conventional loan? Would I benefit from an FHA loan? I have done a lot of research on this, but obviously it's a lot to consider and I could really use some personalized advice. I'm not sure if I'm pointlessly missing an opportunity to get a head start if I delay purchasing a house for a year or even more. On the other hand, maybe it's more worthwhile to have another year of solid credit history and employment under my belt, along with additional savings, than the $7-8k a year I'll lose from renting. 

For reference, I make around $36k a year, post tax. I currently have about $22k in savings, with the ability to add at least $1000 a month to this with my current employment. I have 4 credit cards that I use sparingly and pay in full monthly; the oldest being a little over 2 years. I also took out a $7k car loan last March for the sole purpose of building credit, and now my score flutters around 730. In addition, I may be able to get a small ($10,000) personal loan from a close family member in the event that I need more cash to start.

So anyway, all advice pertaining to my situation is welcome. Feel free to tell me if I'm being naive and stupid as well. I apologize for the scattered post."|BuyOrRent21|False|https://redd.it/ekyz7p|1|1.0|0|0|1|personalfinance
ekyyga|2020-01-06 19:33:03|Which car should we sell?|"Please humor me. I know this isn't really a huge financial decision, but I'd like to think about it from a purely economical standpoint.... I know what my ""heart"" wants to do (I love my car), but I don't want to miss any of the angles here.

My husband will be getting a company car in a month or so (we are so thankful), and we'd like to sell one of our personal vehicles.  Both of our cars have lifetime warranties (if the repair costs more than the car's value at any point, they will just buy out the warranty with the car's value). I'm guessing we will keep the personal car at least 3 more years. I will probably only put about 4,000 miles per year on the remaining car going forward, as we are allowed to use the company car for personal use, including family trips. 

Both loans are paid off. Insurance cost difference is negligible. They are built on the same frame, and they get similar gas mileage. 

I will outline each car below. I have a preference for my own car. I love driving, and cars are more than just tools for me to get from point A to point B: they are an experience. My husband's car feels like an old man's car to me (my husband is not quite yet an old man, but he likes it), and I love the way my car looks.

**Husband's car - 2014 Chrysler 300C**  
\-80,000 miles (above average)  
\-Fully loaded, has a couple features that my car doesn't have that I would like to have but can live without  
\-Has been in a small accident where a turkey flew right into his grill and hood - $1800 damage, fixed  
\-I'm finding it on KBB (without taking the turkey hit into account) for about $14k private sale, probably will have to settle for $**12k** because of the carfax(?).  


**My car - 2014 Dodge Charger** r/T   
\-30,000 miles (below average)  
\-No accidents  
\-I'm finding it on KBB for about $**19.5k** private sale

Does this just all wash out in 3 years when we sell the remaining car? Or should we sell the accident free car now since the other one is already damaged goods? Is there anything else I'm missing??

ekyvn4|2020-01-06 19:27:18|Does the bull market over the last few years bias our retirement calculations?|"Two years ago, I calculated that I would have just enough for retirement, by taking the market value of my 401K, and compounding it with 7% growth/3% inflation, with yearly additions of maxing out the 401K, over N years until retirement.

However, because the stock market has done so well, when I did the calculation today, it turns out that I have a lot more money than I need for retirement. 

However, I don't think this is a fair assumption to make. Isn't the bull market biasing my retirement numbers? Based on this information, it seems it might be better to divert some of the 401K contributions into a taxable brokerage account in the event I wanted to use it for a home or a business. Of course, it would be unfortunate if the current calculation I have is biased because of the bull market, and if any decisions I made based on these numbers resulted in not having sufficient funds for retirement.

Is there a better way of calculating my retirement so I can prevent the bull market from biasing my numbers? For example, is there a way to ""adjust"" the current market value of my 401K? 

For example, assume you started investing in 2015 and put the maximum contribution in (adjusted to 19K for inflation and simplicity), and will retire in 2045, you could just simply do the compounding calculation for 30 years with 7% growth/3% inflation, with 19K yearly additions. Doing it this way, as opposed to taking the current market value, might give you a less biased number.

- $70k company stock
- $157k cash

It's not a profession, but it is a hobby and I have been working on them since i was a little kid growing up (I'm 27 now). So whenever I get the chance to tinker around a car, I'm ready to do it. A few days before Christmas I decided to change the belts on my VW, as they had never been changed before, for a tune up. I decided to do this tuneup because I was going to be driving the car about 800 miles round trip to visit family for the holidays. I had taken one of the belts off the vehicle a few days prior to the car being struck and planned on putting it back on the Monday before Christmas Eve before I headed out to visit family. I would have put it on sooner, but I work 6 days a week. On the Sunday before Christmas, later in the evening (around 7pm) a driver struck my car due to a medical emergency (Thankfully the guy is okay). His son called the cops and notified me, got the report and everything. Well USAA (their insurance) deemed the car as a total loss and in the report took a $485 off the valuation of the vehicle stating that the vehicle is ""overheating and not running"". I explained to them ""Yeah, its overheating because I was in the middle of switching belts and the serpentine belt drives my water pump and alternator. But it is running, turn the keys and you'll see it turns on."" They get back to me and say ""well its overheating."" This is where i repeated ""Yes, it is, the serpentine belt runs my WATER PUMP"". They said they cant be sure that's the reason the car is overheating as it could be a ""blown head gasket or radiator trouble"". I'm wondering how to proceed from here as i think its silly they are deducting nearly $500 from the valuation of the car for a part that costs $40 ($77 as i bought both belts to be replaced since i was doing a tuneup, one was 40 the other 35 + tax) which I had already purchased from a local VW dealership.

I'm 31. It's not exactly a windfall, it's from work, but it seems to be an easy way to describe it. I am self employed.

And while I may make a lot again in the next few years, I really don't expect to be making over 6 figures again for the rest of my life, and I especially don't in retirement. I intend to retire early, and just be living off investments or a low income when I'm past my 50s.

So it seems I should claim a traditional IRA for the years I make over $100k, but I should do a Roth 401k. 

Most posts seem to talk about people expecting to make more when they're older, but when I'm retiring early at 50+, I will definitely not be making more than I am now. 

But, I was wondering about what about retirement income. I mean if I cash in a $50k Roth 401k that's grown for almost 30 years that's now almost $500k, that would be an income claim of $500k for that year...  Obviously I probably wouldn't pull it all out like that, but I was just curious how people factor that. If I put $100k into a solo roth 401k in 2 years, 10% of $1m is $100k if drawn out over 10 years... and if that was traditional, that would be a heavy tax.

Thanks. obv maxing my roth ira already.

Hi all,

I (19) got a letter today saying that I owed approximately 800 in taxes because of some stocks that were in my name that were sold.

The background is that my grandfather has a stock account in my name. It's some special account (I don't have info yet, I'll edit when I do) that does not give me control until I am 21. He sold shares in this account on my behalf and either reported the gains on his own return or did not report them. I'm still trying to figure out which. 

I'm a bit overwhelmed with all this and I'm not sure what I should do. Should I be reaching out to the IRS? Is it easiest to just get him to give me the money and pay? 

Please let me know if you need more information. I'm sorry if this is rambley, I'm a bit stressed right now."|Trainkid9|False|https://redd.it/ekyq2y|1|0.67|0|3|1|personalfinance
ekyq0q|2020-01-06 19:16:24|Best tips to build up savings?|"All right, lovely people. I am trying to get my finances in order once and for all, starting with building up my emergency fund. I’m decent with a budget but money is still a bit tight - I make anywhere from $1000-$1500/month and living expenses come in around $1200. I’m currently setting away $50 a paycheck, half to a Roth IRA and half to a savings account; I’m currently debt free. My goal is to be as spartan as possible for a year or two so I can set myself up for financial stability sooner rather than later. I’m working on chopping my nonessential expenses, and I will be able to pick up some extra hours at work starting next month to help sort things out. 

So what do you all recommend I do to make this easier on myself? Specifically, would you put the Roth on hold until the emergency fund is set, or keep doing what I’m doing? Also, are high yield savings accounts worth it? 

Any advice would be appreciated."|ktelizabeth1123|False|https://redd.it/ekyq0q|0|0.5|0|2|1|personalfinance

ekym34|2020-01-06 19:08:38|NYC metro area edition - How much house can we afford?|"Hi PF,

I know this question gets asked a lot but everyone's circumstances are different.

My wife (28) and myself (29) are looking to purchase a house with the following situation. I will do my best to paint a vivid picture

* My income - $150k plus approx. $90k bonus (been at company for 6 years and bonus has increased every year)
* Her income - $84k plus 15% bonus target (likely closer to 10%)
* Own an apartment worth approx. $650k with $350k mortgage remaining 
   * 15 year mortgage. All in  payment is around $3,800 including taxes and HOAs. The goal is to pay down and recast mortgage till payment is in line with market rent (approx. $3,100).
* Retirement accounts:
   * 401k - $135k
   * Roth 401k - $60K
   * Roth IRA - $32k
* Taxable investment accounts - $150k ($25k or so of l/t gains)
* Company Stock - $286k (value from 2 years ago and hoping this will go up when we sell)
* Classic car - $34k (cars are important to me)
* Cash on hand - $32k
* Liabilities
   * Car lease payment of $260/mo
   * Various Insurance - $270/mo
   * Dog walking - $350/mo

The goal is to keep apartment to rent and buy a house to start a family. Will likely use funds from Company Stock for down payment. We are still saving heavily in anticipation of house purchase. 

Assuming we stay the path how much house can we realistically afford? Please assume real estate taxes of around 2% of property value.

I value the input of this community."|Cpyayyy|False|https://redd.it/ekym34|0|0.33|0|2|1|personalfinance
ekylyh|2020-01-06 19:08:21|Comparing new and different used Honda minivans|"My husband and I are rapidly growing our family and need more space in our vehicle.  We currently share a 2013 Honda CR-V and adore that thing except the lack of space we are now running into.  So we decided we are going to buy a Honda Odyssey minivan. I am really struggling with figuring out whether we should buy new or used.  We are in the position where we have up to $35k in cash for purchasing the van (perhaps a bit more if needed), so financing is not an issue or a problem.

&#x200B;

I have read through the guides about how to buy a new and a used car, but how to decide between the two is something I haven't found much guidance on.  A couple factors that might be useful to know or not:

&#x200B;

* We take a lot of 4 hour road trips on highways to see family.
* We put about 95k miles on the CR-V between the two of us (one car family) within the 4 years, 2 months that we've owned it.  I used to have an hour and a half commute, but now I work from home for the last year, so that number may be lessening, although compensated to a certain extent by more frequent road trips to see family.
* We plan on driving whatever car we buy into the ground.
* We have a mechanic we trust and live in a safe area.  (I used to live in an area where I was afraid of what a breakdown might mean-- not anymore).
* We have a decent emergency fund as well, so any emergency repairs can usually be dealt with.
* Neither of us are comfortable with haggling at all, so I appreciate the guides provided.
* We are not really bells and whistles people so don't really want a lot of extras in the vehicle.

&#x200B;

So my question is which should we start looking for?  How do I compare, for example, a new 2019 model with a 2012 one with 90k miles with a 2016 one with 30k miles?

They do not cover long term disability (until retirement age) pay. I opted to pay $119.65/year post-tax for 50% of my wage. This is through my employer, so the same provider they use for the short term disability.

ekykrn|2020-01-06 19:05:58|What is a good plan for these trusts?|"I'm hoping you great minds can give me some perspective. I apologize in advance for formatting. 

TL:DR; Mom's trust $160k, needs to last her lifetime, shes 61. Sister's trust $27k.

Soon I will be the trustee for two trusts set up after my grandmother's passing. The beneficiaries are my mother and my sister. The trusts were set up to protect their outside financial assistance and because my grandmother didnt trust them with large sums of money. Long history of drug abuse, lies, and manipulation not related to my question. 

The trusts states that they are to be used for the good health, safety and welfare of the beneficiaries. 

Trust #1 (Mother's) will have approximately $160k
Mom is 61, married, disabled, has lung cancer. 

She gets $800/mo for disability. 
Stepdad is 62 and makes $15/hr, so roughly $31k a year (I think).

The only asset they have is a single car that they impulse bought and are still making payments on. No savings. No retirement. They rent a house. They have delcared bankruptcy twice in 25 years. They tried to trade in their car for a brand new $50k truck and was thankfully declined because of their credit.

Their ""dream"" is to move closer to my stepdad's mother and buy a house. 

Her lung cancer is currently inactive. She was diagnosed in 2015 and has recently had a reoccurrence, so estimating her life expectancy is difficult for me. 

I am open to all ideas on how to make this money last for them, as it is all they will have. 

Trust #2 (Sister's) will have approximately $27k. Sister is 40, on food stamps, and state sponsored healthcare.

She says she has a disability (goes back to the lies and manipulations).

She does not receive any government disability. She works part time as a server. She rents an apartment with her boyfriend. They have one car that they are possibly paying on. 

I don't know very much at all about her actual finances or health status. She lives out of state 15 minutes from my my mom. 

Her ""dream"" is to move back to my state to be near her daughter and grandson. 

My family is messy and complicated. My grandmother tasked me with this to help take care of them.

They manage money well but since  they are self employed they are sort of lost when it comes to retirement and want to start on getting something in place now

I’m going to sit down with them to get their income/bills details but from what my guesses are they make around 150k yearly
Mortgage ~1800
1 vehicle payment ~400
No credit card or Loan debt 

When they have large craft shows  and make extra cash they put most of that toward - low interest mortgage . My guess would be (10-15k a year extra) 

My brother in law wants to start taking some of that cash along with monthly contributions to a retirement fund.


Are there any tax advantaged accounts you self employed folks are using other than a traditional/Roth ira? Or is that their best bet?

From what I understand they can set up a 401k with higher contributions ?

It is a 72 month term auto loan @ 5.64%. Original note was for $34,195.13 and I still owe $25,955.79 on it. Loan origination date was 03/31/2018 and maturity is 04/15/2024.

eky9nn|2020-01-06 18:44:13|Exhausted in trying to be debt free, is the light close enough to justify living like this|"The past four years me and my wife agreed to get on the same page to be debt free by 35 and retired by 46. four years ago she graduated college and got a job making minimum wage, two years ago she got her career and that is when we really started cranking out the debt from about 175k to about 113k. We are 31 right now and frankly it is exhausting and I do not know if we even have the budget to meet our goals. It feels like two steps forward and one step back. For example I spent the last four days figuring out a new cellphone plan as we shared a data package from Verizon for 115 a month. We switched to a prepaid ATT plan which costs us now 50 a month with double the data so we saved 65 bucks which is awesome. Then I get a statement that the internet bill has gone up 10 bucks as well as the auto insurance which went up 15 bucks. It is emotionally exhausting that you put in the work to save dollars and then get fucked in another aspect. 

I picked up 4k in overtime in the last six months of the year because we just had another child and we didn't budget in the yearly expenses for daycare so instead of paying less to the debt I picked up overtime to pay for daycare. During this time frame the dog got sick requiring a 300+ vet bill, the cat got a UTI which was another 100, struts went on our vehicle which blew out a tire 550, family vacation that we were dragged into which cost 1400 and that all but depleted out emergency fund. We seem to be living paycheck to paycheck which is our own fault because any extra money goes towards any debt. We both own our cars so we don't have any payments

Our debt situation looks like this. The credit card debt is because we took out a loan from Axos at 8% to put an addition onto the house for a babies room this spring. I thought it was foolish to be paying 8% interest for the next 3 years so I took out a couple credit cards at 0% for 18 months with a 2% original fee. We have currently paid off 8k of them so far in the past few months and throw everything we have at them so we don't have to roll over onto another 0% credit card.

On top of that we take a huge hit with what we put towards our retirement. We put 10% each into a deferred comp program for the state on top of our original retirement plans. Everything has us feeling so thin that it is frankly exhausting, especially seeing our peers in the same income bracket take vacations around the world, buy RV's and toys and frankly go out to a sports event or show every weekend. The last time we went to a show was over a year ago to see transiberian orchestra.  

Anyhow here is the debt situation and her is what I have budgeted. Should we be debt free by 35 and for those that are is it worth it? 

Mortgage- $46750 @3.85%

Wifes Student Loans- $9,000 @3.4%

My Student Loans- $42,000 @6.4%

Credit Card Debt - $16,000 @0% until April of next year

---

Wife's take home bi-weekly paycheck=$1,300 and I budget it out monthly like this ($2,600)

-$600 for groceries for two weeks

-$300 for tuition for oldest daughters school

-$1,250 towards credit card debt

-$125 to student loans

-$40 to personal savings

-$40 to oldest daughters savings acct (youngest we start contributing at 4 like we did with our oldest so they have a comparable amount in there when they are old enough to buy a house)

-$50 to emergency fund

-About 195 is leftover for gas, life insurance payment ($35), streaming services (21), anything for daughters extra curriculars (gymnastics, field trips) and a slush fund if we run out of groceries

------

My bi weekly paycheck is $1625 but I do my budget monthly as most of my account is handling the bills that come in so my monthly amount is $3250

Mortgage- $700 of which about 250 goes towards the principle and the rest interest and escrow

Student Loans-$550

Car Insurance- $115

Savings-$80

Life Insurance- $325

Cell Bills- $50

Gas Bill-$75

Internet- $55

Electric Bill-$100

Oldest daughters savings -$40

Emergency Fun- $50

My Personal Savings -$80

Water/sewer and city garbage- $80

Youngest daughters daycare- $625

Monthly total=$2,925 leaving me with $325 dollars for gas, diapers and formula when needed

Like I said we could just start paying the minimum and start enjoying our money but we want to be debt free, retire early and use the snowball method to pay off the riskiest debt followed by the high interest. At 1250 a month I figure the CC debt will be paid off by January of next year. Our tax returns are usually around 7.5k and we plan on putting that next year towards the mortgage dropping it down to about 35k. Once the 1250 a year is no longer going towards the cc debt we plan to put half and half towards the student loans and mortgage essentially paying them off by around 34/25. I am in the process of refinancing my student loans but the best rate I seem to find is 4.35%. Again not sure if this comes off as a vent but is it worth it in the end and frankly am I doing it right? I know this sub won't like the 325 towards life insurance but I have been paying into it since I was 21 and have some decent assets built up with the dividends.

Here's the deal- my husband and I both work. He has one job, I have one main job, two side jobs, and one 1099 gig. We have 3 kids.

If I put everything into the IRS W-4 calculator, it tells me that for my main job and my husband's job, to add an additional amount for withholding (something like $100 for me and $30 for him, we are paid bi-weekly).

eky7zl|2020-01-06 18:41:00|Is it a good idea to pay off higher interest loans with a lower interest loan?|"I have accumulated a fair amount of debt for my undergraduate degree (approximately $53K USD).  I started graduate school this semester.

$1,022   5.05%    fixed rate            

I have no other debt, just student loans.

Because I did not take a gap in school, my payments are deferred further out, so I am not required to be making payments, but I have been over time during school, and significantly knocked down some of the older loans with variable interest rates.

I know it’s important to pay these as fast as possible, live within means, etc. I am looking for advice on this particular item:

I got approved for a $19,000 Direct Stafford unsubsidized loan at 6.08% (meaning it will build interest while in graduate school). I only need about $8,000 of it to cover the cost of tuition, books, etc.

Would it be wise to accept the full $19K and use the refund I would receive (about 11K) towards my undergraduate loans with higher interest rates?

Or should I only accept the approximately $8K I need to cover costs?

Obviously debt is debt, but I know interest is the part of the loan that makes them so difficult to pay back, which is why I’m tempted to use the lower-interest loan to cover the higher-interest loans."|lmoraco|False|https://redd.it/eky7zl|1|1.0|0|3|1|personalfinance

Making sure I have all my ""ducks""."|"My ex dropped off our child today and he gave a stack of letters sent to my previous address. I received pamphlets advertising lawyer services. One contained a case number for an upcoming lawsuit by a collections company for a debt amounting in the $600 range for a credit card balance.

The lawsuit was filed 12/24. As far as I know the actual summons has not been delivered (probably on its way), as he brought all mail correspondence from that address. I have checked my current mailbox over the weekend, so I haven't received it. 

I followed the wiki for this subreddit and have called the collections agency to send me the validation notice. Once the debt is validated I am going to try and negotiate the debt amount. Then once it is negotiated have them mail a contract. 

Once we are on the same page, I will submit a payment for them. 

Since the actual debt amount is low, I would prefer not to get a lawyer involved. I can make that payment at one time. I'm finally at a point in my life where I have $600 for something like this.  

Now once it does get time to pay I want to make sure all bases are covered so the lawsuit is dropped and the debt is shown as paid. 

I vaguely remember on this subreddit not to use a payment from my checking account. Would paying using a credit card be sufficient? Or would a different payment method work? I don't want the payment to get lost in the mail, but I also don't necessarily want them to have my bank account information either. 

Once payment is submitted, do I get a receipt? 

In the case of a negotiated partial payment, is there some sort of document I can request that would show on their end that the debt is no longer owed (in case they try and sell the remaining balance to someone else)? 

I know that once it is assumed to have the lawsuit dropped to call the county clerk to confirm this information prior to the court date, but once I have made the payment is there any documentation from their lawyers that I can request stating that they are no longer taking legal action? 

If there's anything I may be potentially doing wrong, please let me know.

If there's something that I may be missing, please also let me know. 

I know I made some incorrect choices to get me to this point, but I am confident I can clear things up in the next few weeks. I've never had anything like this happen in my life, so bear with me as I navigate everything."|lunamarjorie|False|https://redd.it/eky391|1|0.67|0|6|1|personalfinance

Well in about a year and a half I can refinance and if possible I would like to drop the PMI part of my mortgage. I would rather that money go toward my loan than basically doing nothing. My question is when I refinance do I need to put down 20% of what is left to pay on my house for such a loan or can I skip that step by my home having that 20% in grown equity from home repair and just general market trend? 

More info on my situation: In the past 3.5 years my house has gone up ~17% in value just from the neighborhood getting better and more desirable. I haven’t done any updating beside some painting and landscaping but I need to reshingle the house this year so it will have a new roof. I also plan on getting a part time job now that my FT job has a set schedule and I want to use that money to pay for the roof, what’s left of my car loan and either use it to update the house more or save for money down at refinancing. 

So is the one way to refinance with dropping the PMI and no money down possible and if so how does it work and which of the two ways would be better overall?

Edit: My original home loan was about 58,000 and I have an interest rate of 4.25%. The accused market value is from Zillow but I have also been looking at other houses around the area and they all have been selling for more lately.

I've been working those hrs for about 2 or 3 years. Before that I was only working maybe 15 to 20 hrs a week for 2 or 3 years for his business as well making $20 an hour. I think last year he said I made something like $45k.

Now before last year I was not being paid through regular checks from the business, but a combination of of checks and I had a business card that he would have me pull cash out of the atm and just using the business card for personal stuff,probably making 20k for a year or 2. Before that I worked for a dude doing landscape and he paid cash.

 Also, my dad is going through tax stuff as well so at some point I think Oct. 2015 we opened a new LLC in my name and he had some part of that like he was an authorized person or something like that??? but after about a year he said he took me out of the LLC and I am no longer connected to it. He has never filed a 1099 for me or given me any sort of tax thing because he hasn't done his taxes in a few years. 

My dad says I am not an employee and he is adamant about that because of workmans comp and that I would be a sub contractor, but that is unclear because I am a family member of the business. He also wants to work out something where I'm a shareholder or VP so I the company wont have any employees. I honestly dont know much about that stuff so if it seems vague I apologize. 

So that being said, idk where to start or what to do. Any help would be appreciated. To be frank I've never voiced this to anyone besides my fiance and I'm sick to my stomach almost every day.

When taking a general loan from a 401k, does the repayment of that loan happen parallel to the normal contributions/employer contributions, or do those standard contributions/employer contributions go towards the repayment of the loan?

I'm trying to figure out what my repayment schedule would be, and if my normal contributions and my employer's match go towards the balance, or if I have to keep contributing as normal, and make additional payments towards the loan. Obviously the repayment schedule would be quite different in those two scenarios.

I have been digging through my companies documents and cannot find any answer to my question.

There’s a chance I won’t be able to pay in full this month, I would choose to not pay minimum payment but pay about 50% of the total. 
My card says the annul effective rate is 85%. 
I have no idea what that means, does that mean I’ll get an 85% interest of the other half of the total I don’t pay this month?

I’m trying to figure out if I should just go ahead and pay the total(putting me in a bit of a rough place this month) or pay half and finish paying it off next month or two since I know for sure I could finish anything I have left on it by March.

ekxf7z|2020-01-06 17:43:40|How do you decide when it's time to move?|"My actual question is: How do you personally decide when it's time to upgrade to a nicer/bigger house, and if you can do it while keeping your monthly cashflow the same, would you even hesitate?

Background:

Age: Early 30s
Kids: one, under 1 yr
Household income: $140K
Debt: $36K mortgage
Current Home Equity: Approx $165K
Savings: $57K cash
Investments: $70K in taxable account
Retirement: Roth 401(k) @ $170K, contributing 15%. Spouse Retirement: Roth 401(k) @ $33K, contributing 6%.

My wife and I are interested in leaving our starter home and moving to a nicer ""raise the family"" home listed for $350K. Ideally, I'd like to take the equity from our current house and sell my taxable investments (under 8% growth, not a huge tax burden) to put around $225K down on a new house. That will keep my mortgage in the neighborhood of $125k and monthly payments around $1600. We were paying $1850 a month between vehicles (now paid off) and current mortgage, so at $1600, that gives me $250 cushion a month without even changing our cashflow.

I am excited about a change and a new house, but the financial side of me is worried about such a huge purchase. I am torn about whether it is acceptable to sell my taxable investments to contribute to a down payment. I tend to squirrel away and watch accounts grow (boring, doesn't improve my life at all) and taking a huge chunk out of my pocket to buy a house scares me a bit.

I've heard people say it's better to get into the house now, while we are young and more flexible, but also heard people say to keep saving and investing and buy something at a later date.

ekxbxg|2020-01-06 17:37:07|Cash Flow Review|" 

Hi everyone, Happy New Year!

Looking to get some input on my financial situation as it stands as far as stagnant cash in accounts listed below....

Short story is:

Dad passed away in 2016, sold house and 5 acres of land in Illinois, closed out his investments / union stuff / insurance policies; and things are finally done as of end of 2018 that we know of.

I’ve kept all cash inheritance liquid in the bank accounts in case of emergency and the future plan to purchase a townhouse.

After everything settled I moved to Florida in July of 2018 and currently working a security officer job, with the plan to go into Corrections after May of this year. If I get into Corrections, starting pay will be $19/hr +/-.

Once I am settled in Corrections that is when I plan to purchase a townhouse to get out of renting an apartment.

I’d like to use some of my inheritance as the down payment on the townhouse purchase, and then rely on my income for the mortgage payment, so in the meantime I don’t want to tie up all my money in long-term investments. And also to have an emergency fund available.....

With the amounts listed below what are your suggestions?

And any questions feel free to ask.....

The Ally Roth IRA has funds in it, but I haven’t purchased anything in 2019 yet.

What specifically should I do with that. Put it toward 2020 and what to purchase with it?

I’m also a male / 42 in April / Single & No kids.

I’m looking for something that is very flexible and I can set my own hours so driving for Uber/Lyft seems like the perfect choice from that perspective.

My current car (2014 Honda) has about 95k miles on it and is worth $7k-$10k. It’s technically my parent’s car but I can use it for free for however long I need to, even if that means I drive it until the wheels fall off or I buy a new one for myself. However selling this car isn’t an option. If I’m not going to use the car, my parents want it back so that they could then give it to my younger brother/sister

I currently live in a large city and barely use this car. As of right now the car is just sitting around gathering dust. Should I give the car back to my parents and save money on insurance/parking or continue keeping the car and driving for Uber/Lyft? Normally the ROI for driving is near minimum wage (based on hearing other people’s experiences) but since the car’s depreciation isn’t really a cost to me, would that make driving worth it?

(3) good baseline interest rates right now and 

(4) a democrat in the white house next year may eliminate student debt. Either loan discharge becomes taxable income (royally screwing me) or I slowly build assets while banks no longer need to offer doctor loan mortgages (also screwing me).

*(All above w/ vanguard)*

Savings: Marcus - ~40K (20k is in a 2.7% CD for a few more months). 

Mortgage: 136K left @ 3.6%. 22 years left.  I've been paying off at a rate where it'll be paid off in 10 years. Bought for 210k, house worth ~500k now. Likely forever home, but we'll see overtime as an ""upgrade"" to us is ~800k now.

This has accumulated all over a period of time and some of it was my mother's ex-bf fault when he used to drive it for Uber. 

It was never the car I wanted to begin with but it was forcefully handed down to me and I was forced to make payments for it since 2015 straight out of high-school. 

My mother's ex-bf eventually transferred it to my name after I had paid it off on the condition I don't trade it in because ""there was too much investment in it"" 

The KBB value is $6250 in fair condition with the amount of mileage it currently has. 

My mother says it's not worth it to trade it in and it's not worth it to fix up at the time because we have other priorities and she wants to hand it down to my 14 year old brother but he's practically illiterate, I don't know how he would get a driver's license.

Recently I took a new job which increased my salary by almost double (83%) which was in a city around an hour and a half away, and as things lined up I decided now was a great time to move in with my SO. 

So my house is currently sitting empty, costing me money every month which I don’t think is a great idea to keep anymore.

I’ve considered renting the house out, however with the tax rate being 40% for any income over £50k here it seems like anyway I slice it I’ll be losing money each month.

My repayments are currently £487 p/m.
And I can expect roughly a £700 p/m rental income.

With tax and agent fees I calculate that I can expect to take home roughly £380 of that £700 which results in a net loss of -£107 p/m or about £1,300 p/year.

Am I right in thinking I should just cut my losses, sell the house likely losing around £5k in the process to fees i.e. early mortgage exit, lawyers, estate agents etc over prolonging this taking a potential loss each month at best case in hopes of selling at a profit in a few years?

Taxes up as expected based on my taxes, not the prior owner and insurance due to adding some jewelry and typical increase. What is getting me about canceling is 1. they want a $2,400 cushion and 2. while my wife and I both have good salaries, a portion of my income varies by month from profit-sharing. Some months I make double my salary, other months I only make my base salary. 

I see canceling as a way to put some more money in my savings account, earn some interest, (I know not much) and allow that fluctuation of income to not disrupt monthly budgets as much. 

We don't have an issue saving money, the plan would be to put the right amount of money into savings every month and our savings account has plenty cushion if there was an issue. 

Are there any negatives other than having to pay things ourselves,  and needing to be disciplined with storing away that money?  

My mortgage payment would go up to 3,500/month from $3,300 not including the short fall I would pay into escrow lump sum of $3,300 owed. Most of that is to put in the required $2,400.00 cushion. 

My equity is almost 30% based on my appraisal when we purchased in 2018. So I believe they will accept the request.

My car is valued around 11k on KellyBlueBook and I currently have about 13k left on the loan (at the time I received a high interest rate). Would it be best to sell the car and then pay off the rest of the loan in cash? That being said, will getting rid of this car loan lower my credit score because I have less open accounts under my name?

What would you do in this scenario? (If you need more information, just let me know).

\--------------------------------------

TL;DR My car is worth 11k and the loan has 13k left on it. When I sell the car should I pay off the rest of the loan in full - immediately? And how will it affect my credit score?"|the_nameless_nomad|False|https://redd.it/ekwvn0|0|0.33|0|1|1|personalfinance

ekgx4b|2020-01-05 18:33:14|How to deal with credit card opened in my name without consent|"Hello, I've managed to get myself into a bit of a confusing situation regarding a credit card account I'm not sure how to handle.  First time posting here but I've seen a lot of good advice doled out on this subreddit.

Background: During last October I was shopping for a new motorcycle and visited a dealer where I was strongly considering buying a new bike.  The salesman mentioned that Kawasaki had a credit card program where I could buy the bike and pay no interest for over a year.  I had enough cash in hand to buy the bike outright, but it seemed advantageous to earn interest on that money for a while if I could do so without consequence.

After specifically telling the sales representative that I did not want a credit card issued unless I chose to buy the bike (I did not), I filled out an application with the understanding that it would be used only to verify my eligibility.  When I asked whether a card would be issued without my explicit request, I was told 'we don't do business like that'.

Fast forward a couple months and a pre-activated Kawasaki Charge Card arrives in my mail box.  I immediately called their service number and canceled the card.  Subsequent calls to that number verify my account status as closed.  There was never any activity on the card.

Current situation: I recently received a letter from Kawasaki regarding promotional interest offers on my account, dated well over a month after the account was closed.

My questions: 

1) Do I need to take action through the credit bureaus to remove the card from my history so my credit score is not affected?

2) Should I request written records from Kawasaki stating that my account is closed?

3) Should I file any sort of complaint regarding the dealer's actions?  If so, where?

4) Do I need to be worried about receiving offers regarding a closed account?  Could it not actually be closed?

Unrelated question since I'm making the post anyways: If, a couple years ago, my credit report got dinged for not making payments because I was carrying a positive balance for >6 months (due to accidental over-payments to the tune of a few grand on a low-balance card), is it too late to fix that?

If I withdraw the money I contributed to the pension fund (plus 3% interest) and place it in a tIRA, will I avoid windfall?

This past year, I saved 35% of my gross income of $74,000  from two jobs- almost all of that in retirement accounts.  I have an emergency fund.  I don't have debt, although I do have a charge-off on my credit report from about 10 years ago.  My credit is non-existent

I don't ever want to read my bank statement, because I am ashamed of spending money stupidly. I know this is not rational.  I spend too much on groceries, and on uber (I don't own a car) and on gifts.  I am 48 and don't own a house - am very unlikely ever to do so in my super HCOL area.  I don't have a bachelor's degree and I think about saving money to go to finish a degree.

From 17 to 30 years old  -  I was always afraid of real financial disaster...  which, for me - mostly meant not being able to get a place to live.  As a renter, I really should improve my credit so that I can make myself a better candidate to any future landlord.  

I have been stuck in this place for years, really.  I have not successfully just sucked it up and done it, with it being:  tracking spending, and a credit building plan...  shame, fear, shame - avoidance.  That's me.

So a few months back I had a big expense coming up so I opened an account with a credit card that had decent cashback and a good chunk of 0% apr. I no longer have a need for the card other than the 0% financing, so my plan is to just pay the balance divided by the months of 0% apr left so that by the time the promo is over, the balance is gone.

After writing it, the question seems stupid, but here goes: since I will not use the card anymore, is there a chance that they might cancel the account, making the whole sum due at once?

ekwd05|2020-01-06 16:27:58|Should I prioritise repaying my personal loan or building up a deposit? (U.K.)|"Last year, after getting ‘persistent debt’ letters, I (finally) decided to actually pay off my £12,000 of credit card debts rather than just pay the minimum monthly payments.  I’ve been going at it really hard, and with my partner’s help have been paying off £2125 per month. Come the end of February I’ll have cleared it completely. 

We’re also going to want to move into a new home in summer 2021. We want to keep our current home (mortgage in partner’s name only) to rent out, so I’ll be applying for the mortgage solely in my name to benefit from my HTB ISA bonus and the first-timer stamp duty relief. 

I also have a personal loan from zopa, which has a fixed payment of £172. If I continue paying that until it’s cleared, I’ll pay a total of approx another £8250, whereas if I pay it off early I save around £1200 of that (based on early settlement sum as of today)

Question: should I prioritise clearing the loan (which will leave me with no debt and no credit) or pump the money into my deposit savings? I’m particularly interested in what mortgage lenders will look more favourably on... lower deposit but zero debt, or higher deposit with debt?

Any advice for me please?

ekwbbc|2020-01-06 16:24:19|My 20/4/10 car buying situation|"Hi all,  
  
I recently graduated and have been working full time for about 5 months and need to buy a car soon. I’ve been driving one of my dad’s cars because mine bit the dust right as I graduated, so I don’t want to continue putting miles on his car when I’m working full time and should get a car.  
  
I’m trying to establish a budget, and just want a second opinion on it. Here’s all my finances I can think of:  
  
Income: $4800/mo BEFORE taxes  
Income left after all monthly expenses: about $1100  
  
Debts:  
$2700 cc debt that I need to pay by April to avoid interest — this was for CoL during my last year of college  
$430 furniture debt bcus I moved out on my own right after graduation, this is interest free for another year almost  
$26000 student loan debt that will be $360/mo for the next... long time, but I’ll be putting any bonuses and surplus cash towards paying them off much sooner.  
  
So after all the debt, I’m left with about $700/mo.  
  
Tax returns will be coming soon, so that will give me an additional $4500 at least to either put down on a car, buy an older car outright, or pay off 2 of the above debt sources.  
  
If I go by the typical 20/4/10 rule, after I get my tax return and whatever I’ve saved by then, I should have (if I don’t spend it all on repaying debt) $5500 to put down on a car. That would put the car at $27500 all in (taxes, fees, title, etc) according to this rule. It would also put the total monthly allowance at $450 for the car payment and insurance, but that would be eating up a lot of my remaining monthly income for the next few months until my debts are reduced.  
  
I’m prioritizing a car over debt because the debt is interest free for a pretty long time, and because I feel bad continuing to add miles to my dad’s car. This would be the most money I’ve ever spent though and it seems like a lot, but I do want to buy a car that will last a very long time and not make me hate life because I do spend a lot of time driving.  
  
I’ve been looking at 4Runners because they’re just the most reliable thing I can find. But I’m also fine with buying one that’s way under that limit because... less stress.  
  
Thank you in advance!

Its clear she cannot make sound financial decisions for herself anymore. The question is how do we dig out. 

The debts $60K in home equity line of credit, and ~$59K consumer debt from running credit reports as of Saturday. 
She brings in roughly $1600 a month from our Dad's alimony, and Social security. Just running the minimum payments on the debt she needs $2550 a month, and that's before she eats or has power. 

The assets, like the house and ~ 10 Acres connected. Plus some land she inherited from her father  with a semi historic house. A further conflict to just selling either or both houses. Our mother is a hoarder, and we are working on her with these issues. However because of the hoarding, both by her and her other family members neither house is a quick sell. 

Just an example of lack in sound judgement, she has very poor transportation, but agreed to a time share at the beach 5+ hours away last April. She has been attempting to make $500.00 a month payments to keep this going. She also feels like she can feed herself off of just $50.00 a month. 

The plan.
1.Get POA
2.The historic house is in the process of being cleaned up for sale by a preservation society. We will be selling this property, but not sure how quickly. This may fetch enough if we are lucky to pay of either of the $60K or the $59K.
3.We are asking her to seek mental health help.
4. We are going to talk to a life estate attorney about options.

There are things she is paying monthly that might be able to be dropped. One is a supplemental health insurance policy, that is currently about $140.00 a month, going up to $170.00 soon. 
Another is a term life insurance policy, it only offers $100K, but will be going from $91.00 a month to $1K a month in a few years.

I'm currently almost halfway through my two year contract, and I thought that it would be a good timeframe to figure out what to do with my life afterwards... which has led me to wanting to YOLO and looking at quitting my job at the end of the year, travelling solo in South East Asia for 3 months, then going ahead and doing travel nursing in the UK on a 2 year working holiday visa.

Since I currently live at home, I'm able to maximise my savings rate and invest at least ~1/2 of my fortnightly pay into ETFs. I'm aware that if I do move to the UK, I would have a lot more expenses and less disposable income, thereby decreasing my savings rate. I've also noted that Registered Nurses in the UK earn considerably less than Australia by at least ~1/3. There's also a lengthy and expensive process to become registered in the UK (approx ~5k) as a nurse prior to finding a job. However I will be going through this with a travel nursing agency specifically catered for this purpose that will reimburse most of these costs if I commit to working four 13-week contracts with them.

Looking at which direction I'd want my life to head towards, I know that if I were to change jobs, that I would want a change – I would want to move out of home, out of the suburbs and find a job closer to the city. However, nothing in Sydney currently speaks out for me and I have no desire to move interstate or do rural nursing, and I have this itching desire to travel the world for longer periods of time, become more independent and grow as a person.

Despite thinking about all the FIRE aspects that should be pushing me against this idea, I think about all the life experiences and memories I would make if I were to take the leap (which living at home, staying in my current job and taking short stints of holidays wouldn't provide me). I feel like if I don't do this at this point in my life soon I'll never do it, and I'll end up having future obligations tying me down and regret ever letting this opportunity pass me by. I also feel like because there's nothing technically 'bad' about my situation (which don't get me wrong, I'm so grateful to be in my position in the first place) that there's no reason to pursue this in the first place if that makes sense?

Has anyone else had any similar experiences? Did you go through with it, what did you do, was it worth it? Did you have any problems pursuing FIRE afterwards?

TDLR; Quitting job to travel for 3 months then taking a 2 year working holiday visa in the UK to do travel nursing, ~1/3 pay cut and potential delay to FIRE, still worth it?

Thanks in advance!"|palm0live|False|https://redd.it/ektdy2|2|0.75|0|0|1|personalfinance
ekhi28|2020-01-05 19:13:49|Could use some encouragement or advice|"Exactly a year ago, my wife (stay at home mom), my two kids (1yr and 3yr), and I moved across the country to be with my wife's family. She was lonely in Florida and her family lives in CA. I live with her mother and I work for her father. I took a pay cut from 68k in a director level position to about 52k as an account manager for the family business with the promise of making what I made in 2018 by the end of 2019. That promise was never fulfilled and I still make 22/hr as a laborer. I realize that I need to leave. Wish me luck on the job hunt! 

I filed for bankruptcy earlier this year to clear about 70k in operating debt from a failed business. Lesson learned. Stay away from debt (for now), work hard, and be much more careful when managing money. 

It's been a rough year. The kind of rough that left me seeing a therapist until our state sponsored insurance was cancelled because of a clerical error. I'm in the process of getting that fixed. I tried to stay positive because our savings account was growing and I knew that we were making sacrifices to save for a down payment on a house. Which made this uncomfortable situation worth it. We have about 10k in the account and I was really proud of our progress.

I just found out yesterday that my wife has several credit cards that I didn't know about that started at 4k in 01/2019 and now amount to 11.5k in debt. So much for our savings account. I went through CreditKarma with her to see what else might be hiding. I made a plan with her to use our savings to pay off the cards to avoid interest ($1400 in 2019) and to consolidate all purchases to a single card afterward so we can track our expenses more easily. Budgets for everything like groceries and regular expenses are in progress as well. I feel foolish, defeated, and like I'm being taken for a ride.

Thanks for reading. I'm sure it'll get better if I stick to the plan."|toMurgatroyd|False|https://redd.it/ekhi28|49|0.79|0|23|1|personalfinance

ekvwzj|2020-01-06 15:54:34|How should I go about saving money more effectively?|"I am currently a junior in uni and would like to have a stronger grasp on my financial situation. 

Currently, I have a wells fargo checking and savings account. The little money I have basically sit in my savings account and I have been considering moving most of my money into a high-interest savings account.

So here are my questions:

1) Should I move my money into a high-interest savings account or an Index Fund? What exactly is the difference between the two and how should you make use of either?

2) What would you say is the best way to deal with this situation. I don't really use my savings account like I should. My job deposits a check into my account biweekly. I'll give myself like 25% of it to use and deposit it into my checking and keep the remaining 75% in my savings. However, I find myself looking at my savings as a ""back up checking"" pulling out money whenever I use up the 25% that I earn. Due to this, I am not really saving any money and actually have just stagnated. 

I was thinking of doing something like this. 

Open a high interest savings account. Each paycheck I get, deposit 70% of it into the HI savings account and don't touch it. The remaining 30% I'll deposit into checking and use as needed. 

3) Should I say screw the wells fargo savings account and just close it? Making use of the HI savings account solely? Any use in keeping it open?"|Bored_Conscious|False|https://redd.it/ekvwzj|1|1.0|0|5|1|personalfinance

ekvqco|2020-01-06 15:40:50|Should I try to pay my mortgage as fast as possible or invest?|"Hey guys!

I bought a house a few years ago and my current situation is like the following:

My house has about 80m² (3 1/2 rooms, small garden, own parking space - cellar has about 30m² extra) in a small town (\~ 60k inhabitants) directly next to a bigger city with about 300k inhabitants in the northern part of Germany.

I bought that house in October 2015 for 79.000€ (\~ $90k) and took therefore a credit/mortgage with in total 100.000€ ($115k) when my earnings where about 30.000€ / $33.500. This mortgage is splitted to three different banks/providers:

1. **50.000€** / $53.000 with an **interest** of about **1,7%** p.a and **amortation** of **5%**. - Already payed \~ 10k€ / $11k back.
2. 33.000€ / $35.000 with an **interest** of about **2.1%** p.a., **amortation** of **5%** and a right to a **special repayment** of **5%** of the sum (1650€/$1700) annually  - Already payed \~ 12.600€ / $14.000 back.
3. 17.000€ / $18.500 with an interest of about 3.75% p.a. and an amortation of 5% - Already payed \~ 4.000€ / $4.500 back.

So **in** **total** i **already payed \~ 26.600€ / 29.500$ of 100k€ / $110k**. Thanks godness, the real estate market increased the last years a lot in our region which led to the fact that my house is now worth a lot more (about 200.000€ - 230.000€ / $220k - $250k).

&#x200B;

Due to a promotion I am currently making about 60.000€ / $67.000 per year and have savings in my depot (stocks) of \~15.500€ / $17.500 and \~ 2.000€ / $2.250 in my other accounts. With my depot i am currently making about 4-5% return each year, regardless if the shares are falling or increasing. Due to the fact that i am living in Germany i do not see the need of an healtcare fund or something similar.

My **monthly income** is after taxes and social security deductions about **3.000€ / $3.350 per month**.

What i currently need to pay is:

\- **House**: 600€ for mortgage / 250€ for warm costs (heating, power, water, insurances, waste...) - total of **850€ / $950**.

\- **Car**: 300€ per month for leasing + 120€ for insurance + 25€ for taxes + 100€ gas -> total of \~ **550€ / $620**

\- Netflix, Spotify, Gym -> **50€ / $60**

\- Groceries, clothes, bars -> **400€ / $450**

\- Vacations: **300€ / $335**

**Total: 2150€ / $2415**

&#x200B;

This leads to 850€ / 950$ each month i can spend for either investing in stocks or similar things or paying my mortgage. I personally don't really like the fact that i have debts when i in fact have the opportunity to spend more money on paying those debts. Unfortunatly my local bank - or better my contract - does not allow to increase the payments, if i would like to do so, i would need to pay a lot money as a penalty. Its about 3000€ for the two first credits and about 3.500€ for the one with the high interests and the small amount.. That really drives me crazy, because i almost pay as much interests as the amortization-rate (50€ interests, 75€ amortization-rate) for that credit..

I could pay all the credits in once with a single, different credit from another bank to increase the monthly payment, i could only pay the one with the high interests with my money which is in my depot or i could just leave it where it is to invest in e.g. stocks.

Do you have any tipps for me? Should i just leave it as it is? Or do you also see the opportunity to decrease the amount of my credits faster?

Please excuse any misunderstanding or inconvenience, english is not my mother tongue! :) If you got any further questions, i will try to answer them as fast as possible :)

Any advice is highly appreciated! Thank you very much!!

ekvoxx|2020-01-06 15:37:48|25 years old, living in Australia, need help with financing, savings vs paying off debt.|"Hi lads,

I’ll try to keep this short and straight to the point as possible, as this questions must’ve been asked hundreds of times in this forum. 

Please bare with me as this will be my first post here.

I’m currently single, got a job earning approx 4K a month. I pay no rent as I live in one of my parents property, My monthly bills are approx $800, excluding the car payment.

I have a super account and salary sacrifice for it for extra contribution.

I have a car and still has approx 40K in debt to it, I pay $1250 a month.

I have a interest free debt of 5K, it should be payed off in 4 months.

I currently have a savings account of 40K, I’ve earned a ~$62 interest on it this month. I put $500 a month into this savings account. I want to use this account as a down payment for my own house in 3-5 years time.

Honestly I do not have a single clue about financing and just winging it at this stage of my life. I’ve tried googling my dilemma but there is no straight answer, which would be the same here. However I just feel more comfortable hearing advice from “real” people and not those who have a hidden agenda.

Thanks in advance and I appreciate any assistance you guys can provide.

ekvlax|2020-01-06 15:30:02|Deciding which stock lot to sell|"I want to sell some of the shares I have on $STOCK but I'm not sure what is the best strategy to do so. 

As context, I have a fully funded emergency fund and I'm contributing to my 401k, so I'm not looking for advice on this aspect.

To make it simple, let's say I bought my holdings on 5 different lots divided as follow:

1. 10 shares bought @ $500 >1 yr ago
2. 10 shares bought @ $1000 >1 yr ago
3. 10 shares bought @ $1,500 >1 yr ago
4. 10 shares bought @ $2,000 <1 yr ago (short term)
5. 10 shares bought @ $1,750 <1 yr ago (short term)

Current price of $STOCK is around $1,800. I believe the price will go up so I don't want to liquidate my position, but want to sell 4 shares to contribute to my IRA. I can sell individual stocks from each lot, so I'm debating what my strategy should be 

1. Sell 4 shares of lot (4) so I can deduct the maximum loss at the end of the year.
2. Sell 4 shares of lot (1) so if the stock goes up I liquidate the shares with the highest gain
3. Sell 1 share of lot(1) along with 3 of lot (4) to do a mix of the previous points
4. Something else completely.

My quandary is that I am still cutting it pretty close to the edge every month. When my salary is cut back, what I’ve been able to save now is almost exactly the payment I make on my car, which I owe $10K on (3 more yes of pmts). I’m feeling anxious about cash flow starting this summer.

There's a 1 bedroom that's awesome near me for $1,600/month but with no common amenities. After much apartment searching, this place is perfect and I love it. Rarely do apartments become available in this building, especially for this price. 

Initially, my partner was set to move to my city early this year, so I started looking at places. Now they won't move until late spring/early summer, which changes the affordability. If I move I need to find a sublet and buy items for the new place (I only have bedroom furniture). My Max budget for rent would be $1,400/month according to rent calculators, but I'm not in debt or have substantial monthly bills. 

Places become more expensive in the spring and summer so I'm worried about missing out on this place. I also worry about another delay in my partner moving and therefore missing out on living at a place with a pool for the summer months. Financially as a single person it makes sense to stay where I am but as a couple, this would be the ideal place to move.

Typically it should be the ones with the highest APR but I figured I'd ask. I am a Commercial Aircraft Mechanic by trade. 

**The Loan:**

I have been approved to a $10,000 loan thru USAA with bi-weekly payments of $107.47 stating in February. The APR is 13.75% for 60 months. That breaks down to $53.75 a week I can more easily manage. 

**The Debt:**

CARD ...............| BALANCE |  APR |  Interest/MONTH  
  
Chase (Amazon) | $3139   |  20.74% | $56.98 |   
Citi Simplicity ... | $3125 | 18.49% | $51.78 |  
Chase Freedom . | $4886 | 14.74% | $45.18 |  
Lowes ...............| $5080 | 0%/27% | %20.25 | 

The Lowes Card has 0% interest on the majority of it until April 2020. it has 27% on some of it now.  


**Income:**

$800 after taxes every Friday, Overtime and Swap Pay (work someone else's shift hours for Regular pay) available in February. 


**Expenses:**

$945/month Mortgage

$1647/Month Child Support

$500-800 a month in Bills/Groceries/Gas and of course this Credit Card Debt, working on lowering it all now. 


I know that I am currently over my means. I took a $419/week pay cut from Overtime pay transferring from a Regional Airline to a major one as it was a tremendous opportunity for the future. I will be off ""probation"" and able to work overtime and Swaps again in February and foresee my pay going back up some. Child Support gets re-negotiated in April. I own my vehicle outright. 

I've had YNAB for over a year for budgeting as I got in with the grandfathered rate a year ago but wasn't dedicated enough to stick with it. I'm going all in starting now. 

I'm considering putting at least $1,000 of this in my pathetic savings as an emergency fund and buffer for overdrafts. 

I've also considered canceling at least one of these cards or 2 and transferring the remaining balances to a zero interest card for 18 months (My Citi Simplicity had 20 months but ended last year, I paid it off then bought a house and needed new carpet which was split between it and Lowes card)

ekuy05|2020-01-06 14:38:37|First Time Home Buyer Questions|"So, I'm meeting with a banker today to work on pre-approval for a mortgage. She was recommended by my realtor, who I do trust. I'm just nervous because I feel like I'm in way over my head. 

For background, I'm 32. My only debt is student loans that are deferred currently as I'm headed back to school for my master's degree. FICO is a little over 700 currently (mortgage FICO scores according to MyFICO). I have roughly $20k cash in savings, with another roughly $3500 due in tuition reimbursements from work in the next month that can just be added to that. 

What do I need to look out for? Any suggestions on questions to ask or things to be aware of? I'm leaning towards an FHA mortgage because I probably don't have enough cash for 20% down anyways, and I'd like to maintain some liquidity for emergencies and some things that may come up with the new house. 

I'm leaning towards a price range of $150k, which is not unreasonable in my area. My current gross income is approximately $3500/month, with some extra cash coming in on the side from some flipping I do as a hobby, usually grossing $500-$1000 a month, but nothing I can truly rely on, and the actually profit is probably around half of that amount.

ekumcm|2020-01-06 14:11:12|Another TSP tax question|"Not looking for judgement, advice, etc for the decision, simply just trying to figure out what I will owe in taxes.

So Im withdrawing all my TSP funds from my military time. Its just shy of 17k. I can no longer contribute to it, and have a federal (FAA) TSP now. Not looking for ""why did you do that, you should have done X"". I did it for personal reasons, and I just want to ensure I am prepared at tax time.

About 2k of my contributions were traditional, mostly from service matching of 5% in my last ~1.5 years. The rest of the contributions were all roth.

The TSP withholds 20%. From what I understand reading the various TSP information contained in various PDFs, 10% is a penalty. Thats fine, whatever. The other 10% is withheld for tax purposes.

Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe the PDFs read as: I am liable for taxes on all the roth *earnings* and traditional contributions and earnings. The roth contributions are not taxed, since I already paid tax on them.

So since traditional contributions were about 2k, my total roth contributions add up to 10.4k. 

1. So do I just owe taxes on the 6.5k difference between roth contribution and current total? 

2. Am I taxed on the 10% penalty, or is that deducted? 

3. Should the 10% withheld for tax (about $1700) be enough to cover the taxes I will owe on the ~6.5k? (my taxable income for 2019 was like 35k)

4. Also, does this go on my 2019 or 2020 taxes, I applied for the withdrawl 3 days ago, so I assume 2020, just want to verify.

I plan to put 10k into my new federal TSP, and use the remainder for other things. Within the next month I plan to dump about 1k a month into my TSP for at least the next 2 years when I will be having a financial change and will reevaluate.

\-I have read just enough information on buying houses, mortgages, etc. to have a cursory knowledge, but now would like some advanced help

\-Wife and I have enough in savings to cover 3-3.5% down payment on a house, but would need the seller to cover closing costs

\-I have been offered several mortgage options and am unsure which is the best option. So far, it's been a downpayment assistance program with an interest rate of 4.75%, where I would still end up covering about 1% of the overall house, an FHA loan with a 3.9% interest rate, or a conventional 97 with a 3.9% interest rate.  


Also, I make good money salary wise, so we're covered, but the one thing I haven't figured out how it will affect me is I technically have a company car. It's a salary increase, but it is not part of my monthly pay. I'm waiting to see my 2019 W2 to see how/if they break out the car from my traditional salary.

My main questions are: what's the best loan typically? Since the downpayment will wipe out most of my savings, would it make more sense to take the higher interest rate loan with the lower up front cost?

ekroda|2020-01-06 09:15:34|18 Year Old Trying to be Financially Independent??|"(Sorry if the title’s wrong)

Hello! I’m a lost fresh high school graduate that doesn’t know much and would like some advice and pointers in the right direction.

tl;dr I need tips on how to work and study full time in uni as I need to be able to provide for myself and my mother. For context I’m located in Melbourne, Australia. 

To explain my situation, I have just graduated high school and start uni in March. The only work experience I have is in a fast food restaurant. My mother is an immigrant who is in her late 60s and as a result cannot work much; as the work she could get with no Australian degree and limited English was a labour type job. However her body is quite frail now and she can’t work many hours. (she has been working in Australia short a very short time so she doesn’t have much in her SUPA either) She received much help from centrelink and child support, but now that I’ve turned 18, she doesn’t receive that support anymore and is struggling to stay afloat. 

Currently I’m overseas but I’m returning to Australia in a week or two. So I’m limited in what I can do right now but as soon as I come back I’d appreciate some advice on what I should do moving forward. Whilst I used to have a job, I quit when I went overseas, so I’m unemployed at the moment. 

I’m aware that I can apply for youth allowance from centrelink and as my previous job underpaid me I think I can go to fair works and get some money back that I’m owed? I’ve tried to research into this and I don’t think it applies to me as I did part time work at a fast food place and I no longer work there. I’m a bit confused with this so if someone could help me out I’d appreciate it very much!

Is anyone aware of any okay paying jobs for someone with little to no experience? I am willing to undertake short courses in order to get a certification for a particular job. I’d probably have to get multiple jobs which I’m okay with, I’m a bit apprehensive about applying to any random places as I have now discovered that some places can and will underpay. (please forgive my ignorance and for being naive, but I’ve learnt from this mistake and I’m sure I’ll make many mistakes moving forward but I will learn from them!)

I’m just quite confused and overwhelmed so there might be an obvious solution or course of action that I’ve overlooked!!"|hmm111_|False|https://redd.it/ekroda|2|1.0|0|2|1|personalfinance

Debt - none. We had a $250k mortgage for our current home (a condo) that we just paid off 3 months ago.

Assets - $200k cash on hand in a savings account and contribute 15% of our incomes to retirement (husband also gets a pension fund). $50k in a taxable brokerage account. $15k in HSAs and FSA. Husband uses a take-home vehicle from work so we only have one paid off car worth about $45k per KBB. 

Spending - My husband’s workplace pays for our health and life insurance 100%, and other small perks like free gym memberships, gas, etc. Since our mortgage payment was eliminated, we’ve been dumping much of our income into the savings account which earns little interest. We’re not big spenders. 

I am seeing the following options: 
1. Buy a duplex/triplex to rent out (about ~$700-900k in our area for a decent cash flow one)
2. Buy a house for us to move into and rent out our current condo (desired house would be about $800k, our condo would rent for $2500/mo)

Looking for some guidance. I've done a bunch of research on this topic, but there's a lot of differing opinions. Thought I'd see what you guys recommended.

I have an emergency savings fund of 6 months. I had a SEP-IRA (business owner), which transitioned over to a 401k as I have 2 employees and wanted to provide a retirement option for them and a match offer. I have put in $17K per year into the SEP and will be putting in the full $19K to the 401k for FY2019. I also have some money in mutual funds.

My mortgage is $1.815 per month @ 4.375%, with $368,000 owed. Not including property tax. I bought the house 16 months ago.

My question is, should I continue to max out my 401K @ $19,500 (went up $500 for FY2020) OR contribute $10,000 to 401K and $9500 (or more if I can afford to) to the mortgage to drive down the interest?

My gut tells me to put the full amount to the 401K and, if possible, any additional should be pushed towards mutual funds as, statistically, it's a higher rate of return than what I would save putting the money towards my mortgage.

However, $360K is a lot of money and the interest on that over 30 years is almost double.

ekr8jp|2020-01-06 08:26:56|Employer offers traditional 401k and 401k Roth. Should I also invest in Roth IRA?|"Hi all,

I'm a 21 year old crawling my way into the investing and retirement world. I couldn't find another reddit post with a similar enough scenario so I figured i'd post this. My annual income is 36k and as in the title, my employer offers a 2% full match and after that up to 5% half match for both a traditional 401k and a Roth 401k.

Now I know what the difference is between a traditional 401k and a Roth 401k/Roth IRA. Please correct me if I am wrong, but a traditional 401k takes a percentage of my paycheck into an investing account I cannot access without a penalty after the age 59-1/2. However, the money is not taxed when taken out of my paycheck but rather when I take the money out of the account after the age of 59-1/2. How much I get taxed is dependent upon my tax bracket upon removing the funds. A Roth IRA/401k is money taken out of my paycheck and is taxed at that time with my current tax bracket and is tax free money when I take it out of the account. Considering as I am 21, I decided to max out my Roth 401k contributions and only contributed up to what my employer would fully match for a traditional 401k.

After reading some other reddit posts, I've found the general consensus for youngsters is to open up a Roth IRA asap. I'm a little late to the party and discovered what investments and retirement plans altogether were through my employer. Should I still open up a Roth IRA regarding my income?

Thought I’d tag [this](https://imgur.com/WN5kquR) too and see if anyone can help me out on this, but this is all words and numbers to me. My employer offers an automated application to help design my own portfolio. Upon reading other reddit posts, it is generally a perk for youngsters to be aggressive investors as we’ve got “nothing to lose” so I based my portfolio off of that. Still, I have no idea what it is and am curious if this is albeit *decent* allocations?

Taxable accounts: $3,000 in index funds (this is mainly used for a house down payment that I want in the future, probably around 10 years which is why I invested the money and not put it in a savings account).

After rent and expenses I put $500 in a Roth IRA and $700 in a taxable investment account. I’m no longer putting money into savings because it doesn’t make sense when I can get a bigger return doing long-term index fund investing. 

Let’s say I want to buy a house in 10 years. By my investing in index funds ($700 a month on average) and assuming an 8% return, in 10 years I will have $128,000 for a down payment, but after taxes (let’s assume 15%), I will have $35,000 in profit or $120,000 (assuming I take out everything). I’m sure that this number will be slightly higher as my pay increases and I put more than $700 a month.

$120,000 down affords a $600,000 house, assuming 20% rule. In Bay Area, there’s no way you can buy a nice house for $600,000. It’s crazy that I’m making a 6 figure salary yet have to worry that I won’t have enough for a house. I don’t understand how people can afford homes here. Should I just put less money into retirement? Am I not saving enough on my income? I was born in raised in California, and do not want to move out to a cheaper cost of living city.

All amounts are in NZD with USD in brackets afterwards.
Finally, at age 33, I am becoming financially literate. I've been doing a lot of reading, have created a household budget, and I'm trying to make a plan for 2020.
I'm interested to hear what your next steps would be if this were your financial situation:

- Married couple, 33 and 35, after tax income for this year will be at least $67000 (44000) after tax and Kiwisaver. That's around $2600 (1700) every 2 weeks. We will have around $400 (260) extra every 2 weeks by the end of the year but I haven't budgeted that in yet because of Novopay's unreliability when it comes to pay increases.
- We have 2 children, 1 and 4 years old. I stay at home and we don't have set plans for me to return to work.
- We pay $50 (33) a week to my in laws for our car
- We put any purchases we can on our credit card and always pay off the full amount
- Our mortgage is currently $181,590 (120000) at 4.96% p.a. We pay $551 (360) fortnightly. We refix in November. Home is currently worth $450000-500000 (315000)
- We have $60,000 (40000)overdraft available (revolving credit from mortgage that we paid off before kids. I'm leaning towards getting rid of it, it's been sitting there for 4 years and it incurs fees account fees)
- I still have student loans, but seeing as I'm not working they're just sitting there. I don't even know how much... around $15000-$20000... (11000) [For the non New Zealanders - we don't pay interest on student loans.]
- My husband is contributing to Kiwisaver, 3%, and he has no student loans. His balance is $35000 (23000) with ANZ and mine is $15000 (10000) with ASB. Both high risk. [For the non New Zealanders - this is our retirement scheme. There are government contributions and employee contributions.]
- We have life insurance, income protection insurance, car, home and contents.
- We have $2200 (1400) in savings which is basically earmarked for insurance and rates payments, $400 (250) in the bank, and our next credit card payment is $1900 (1200) - so we're basically living pay check to pay check in a low cost of living area.

I've got a couple of specific questions:

1. We have income protection insurance. Once we have 3 months income saved up should we get rid of that? For context our parents would be able to support us in emergencies.
2. What % would you be contributing to Kiwisaver if you were my husband? Just the minimum to get the government match? 3%? More?
3. What would you do with the overdraft?

I feel a bit stuck and frustrated at this point. Having done the budget I actually can't see anywhere that we can trim the fat. We don't dine out much, we barely travel, we don't really drink. I do have a better idea of where our money goes, but I don't think it's going to make much of a difference to how much we are able to save.

I'd appreciate any feedback, advice, encouragement! Thanks"|polylop|False|https://redd.it/ekoafx|4|0.86|0|5|1|personalfinance

eksqby|2020-01-06 11:10:01|How to manage rentmoney savings|"Hi everyone,

Im a student from Denmark, which means I recieve what we call SU, a kind of grant from the government to support students. Its about 5100 dkk after taxes. Also I work part time as a studentprogrammer in a bank making around 6800 dkk a month, also after taxes.

The SU grant covers basically 50% of my rent including electricity, internet and so on. My problem is I wont recieve SU the last 2 years of my education, as I studied Electrical Engineering for 2 years, before dropping out, and there is a limit to how many years I can recieve SU, as the government had problems with people enrolling for college and not showing up their entire life, making bank off all the SU. 

The money I make from my job is enough to pay for food, gym, vacations, dinners/experiences with my gf, hobbies, savings and so on, so I can live of that easily, if SU covers my rent.

Technically I could live entirely off the money from the job at the bank, and I have done that before. But I couldnt afford to do anything fun, and I had to cook in big batches and eat the same thing for dinner 2 weeks in a row... Not fun, so I would like to avoid that. 

Since I started my new education as a software engineer I have been saving half of my SU, and I plan to use that money as rent money for the 2 years I dont recieve SU anymore. Since I started software engineering this summer I have saved 15.000 dkk, and I kind of want to invenst it, but Im scared I'l lose it, and I wont be able to maintain my life as it is now, if I lose that money.

What would you suggest I do? Do I invest some if it, or is my fear of losing that money totally irational?

Ps I cant get more money from my job to support any ivenstments, as my SU will get cut if I make more than 12.000 a month from my job (I make 11.800, which is 6800 after taxes)."|DrRungo|False|https://redd.it/eksqby|1|1.0|0|3|1|personalfinance

We are looking to buy a house for between $200-225k. I expect to continue working the same job remotely after the move and she is a teacher, so it shouldn't be hard for her to find work. Also, we plan to get married in June, right after we move. All of this seems doable and even though June will be a hectic month, it all feels pretty manageable. 

Then, just a few days ago, we found out that she's pregnant. We had been trying for the last few months and were feeling ready, but when she didn't get pregnant immediately, it seemed like it may be somewhat of a blessing, allowing us time to get established in Durham before having a baby. She really wants to take a year off teaching during the child's first year and I want to help with that. She plans to work part-time to add some supplemental income. We spaced out her paychecks from this year so that she has pay for the summer. Everything seems like it could work...

...except for the family glitch (IRS ruling on the ACA that causes lots of trouble for certain households). My employer offers a health care plan that is reasonably priced for me and also offers plans that will cover a spouse, a child, or the whole family. However, to cover us both, along with a child, the cost shoots from \~$225/month to \~$1300/month. I make just a bit too much (about $45k) to qualify for Medicare or CHIP. At this point, I'm looking at an extra $12k to cover insurance for the year after the child's birth.

Information I'm looking for:

\- Similar experiences in which you've figured out how to navigate through the family glitch

\- Experience working in Durham Public Schools during/around the time of pregnancy and the possibility of getting insured even though she won't be able to teach full-time during the first school year we're there (she can sub or work part-time).

\- Knowledge of any programs offered in Durham/NC/federal that would be helpful

I am 20 years old and a little over a year ago I decided I wanted to open up a Roth Ira through chase. Over time I put $2200 dollars in my roth ira for the 2018 year. However, when my w2 came I realized I only made about $1800 on the books in 2018 and therefore over contributed. Due to this realization, I pulled the $2200 out of my account. However, I left the earnings that I made from that money in the account because I wasn't sure what to do because I over contributed. In the 2019 year I contributed $1600 which is not an over contribution because I have made that much. I have all of the money in the roth ira right now in cash ($1991.48) till I figure this out. I dont know if it matters but I did not claim the $2200 in contributions on my 2018 taxes but I plan on claiming the $1600 on my taxes this year.

So here are my questions:

1. What do I do about the $391.48 in earning that are partialy made from the 2018 over contributions and partly from the 2019 contributions. If I do have to pay taxes on the over contributed money's earnings, how do I know how much of those earnings were from the 2018 money and not the 2019?
2. I do not have to pay taxes on taking the $2200 out of the roth ira because distributions of the contributions are tax free, correct?

Thanks in advance for the help, I just want to get this all sorted out so when I look at my roth Ira balance I know that it is the true balance."|Sudden_Nectarine|False|https://redd.it/ekopp9|3|1.0|0|2|1|personalfinance

I assume it's *similar, but better than* what I have at EJ?

[**Details from their website:**](https://www.wealthfront.com/cash)

* FDIC insured up to $1 million.
* Cash is kept out of the markets; no market risk
* Unlimited, free transfers
* No advisory/management fees
* Not a promotional rate

I spotted this **disclosure**:

>""The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for the Cash Account is as of a specific date, and may change at any time. The national average is based on Bankrate.com, as of November 01, 2019.""

So. I understand that this rate has gone up and down in the past and there are plenty of factors affecting it. Plus it seems like in the past year it was over 2%!

I lurked on r/investing and I've noticed that some folks have been disappointed by Wealthfront's investing performance, plus they've gotten in trouble with the SEC in the past year. So, with caution, I don't plan to invest with them anytime soon.

What to make of this? Should I go for it? Would it be wise to dump all $24K into this account? :\]

ekkf7s|2020-01-05 22:50:57|Advice on Setting Long-Term House-Buying Goals|"I (25) and my fiancee (24) are recent college graduates renting an apartment together. At the moment, she and I make a combined ~100k a year on a nurse's wage and teacher's salary respectively. We have ~10k in savings, and she has about 8k between her 401k and her roth IRA. I have ~75k in student debt, and she has $150k. I've been trying to help us do some long-term financial planning for us both, and I was hoping to get some advice here.

At the moment, our monthly budget breakdown looks something like this:

**Income**: ~5700, plus or minus depending on whether she works overtime or I cover extra classes during my planning periods. 

**Expenses**

Credit Card Minimum Payments: 140 (on about $4500 of debt)

Car Payments: ~570 (on about $11,000 and $~26,000 respectfully)

Student Loans: ~1650

Rent: 755

Internet: 65

Electric: 200

Phone/Car Insurance/Renter's Insurance: 370

Gas: ~275

Food: ~400

Summer School Savings Fund (to continue paying bills in the event that I am unable to secure a position in a summer school this year): ~450

**Total: ~5,000**

With the understanding that money towards a mortgage builds equity and money towards rent is, well, more or less wasted, I was wondering whether or not we could afford a home -- or if it would be wise to. In terms of immediate goals for money, I understand that the most efficient place to put funds would probably be:

* Make contributions up to the matching limit for any 401k / 403bs at our current job (no matching at the moment)

* Get married sometime in the next 1-2 years so we can start filing taxes jointly

* Save 3-6 months of expenses for an emergency fund (~15-30k)

* Pay off the credit cards

* Pay off the student loans

* Pay off the cars if they have a balance at this point

* Put ~500/ea or as close to it a month per person into our Roth IRAs

* Pay off the remainder of whatever mortgage we presumably have at this point

* Put as much into 401ks/403bs as possible

As a teacher, I have a state pension that, by the time I eventually retire at my anticipated age of 63, should cover 75% of the average of my 5 highest years of employment, so the IRA that I plan to start contributing to is moreso to diversify my retirement income and, perhaps, to help if I decide to retire earlier at reduced benefits. My fiancee plans to soon try to get a job with the state as an RN, so she may soon be in a similar situation soon, hopefully. I was wondering if this timeline looks appropriate and responsible, where in this timeline we would be most responsible for putting ""take out a mortgage,"" and whether or not it would be completely irresponsible for us to look at mortgages right now. 

Our lease is up in May and we are eager to start building equity with a starter home for 5 or more years, although I know that for the first few years the payments will primarily cover interest instead of principle. We also don't have much for a downpayment, although I heard that with an FHA loan you can avoid needing the traditional 20%, although I'm still not quite sure out PMI works, or what sort of programs there are for first-time home-buyers. We are still pretty new to the process, so any advice would be appreciated! We are worried that our inexperience could leave us ill equipped to recognize that we are ready to buy a house and delay our progress, and that if we sign a second year for our current lease when it comes up in May, we will end up locked in for that whole year (or at least subject to the headaches that come with breaking a lease) when we could have moved more quickly on the process now."|PM_2_Talk_LocalRaces|False|https://redd.it/ekkf7s|8|0.84|0|18|1|personalfinance

It shot my score up to 750. We started the process, and it's been taking some time. A year and half later now, my score was up to 763. All of a sudden I got an email that my score dropped 120 points, and it's at 643. Apparently my mother spent a SHIT TON on Christmas, and my score completely tanked. Idk what to do now. I'm not sure if the best step is to get taken off immediately, or to wait for her to pay the balance and it to reflect, or what.

Long story short, I'm looking for advice on what the best way to invest roughly $2000 would be. I'm not really interested in getting involved in stocks or anything of that nature, I really don't want to test my luck. I was looking into a Bank of America savings account as that's where I do my banking, but I read that any ""Standard"" savings accounts won't generate more interest just based on the interest that you've earned, only the money you add. If this is the case, would a Tbond be a better option for me?

So, with a few things in consideration or reasons why I need them. But it costs too much - $70-90. I don't earn a lot, but I can pay for it but it takes out a big chunk out of my salary. It basically means I have to reserve a big portion of my salary for this luxury.

\- I'm always on the go (out doing field work or going to different sites for work, using a cloud-based web-app which is still work related, and for non-work related just pretty much out most of the time with my friends or anywhere, going to the mall, running errands, chilling out, or just plainly watching and staring into my phone when waiting for something)

\- I consume A LOT of Data (YouTube, Live Streaming -- twitch/mixer/fb gaming, Netflix, Anime Streaming, Reddit, Facebook, etc.) they are the apps I usually use, and I use them a lot, meaning watching/streaming videos for hours on HD/HQ (immediately can consume gigabytes of data in less than an hour) -- I watch a lot of  Live ESPORTS events which varies in time so I would want to stream them anytime anywhere

\- I communicate with family/friends through video chat  which also consumes so much data especially FaceTime - consumes almost a gigabyte for maybe 20-30 minutes of video chat after connecting it via hotspot on my mac (FaceTime, Messenger, Viber, Telegram, etc.)  


\- It can enable me to work outside of office (especially when I'm on a laptop and won't have to budget the time of usage or the sites I could visit or the overall activity, it becomes super useful)

\- I use cloud based apps for media (pictures, videos) - accessing them or downloading/uploading content on a regular basis

Current mortgage 600k min payment 3170 pm by pay 3400 pm. 27 year term.

From my calculations, the additional payment reduce the term and save me about 53k in interest, with the term of one fixed loan moving to 22 yr from 27 yr

So if I was to take that 230 I’m paying extra per month and sticking it in my vanguard getting 6% after tax over those 22 years, I would have saved 78k so a net benefit of 25k.

I didn’t graduate, since I could never make up my mind about a major, and ended up wasting my time, and now, money.

Through some research I’ve found that Navient may be able to help me lower the monthly amount I pay with income-driven payments. And I’ve already looked into refinancing my private loan, and all it did was make my payment higher, I believe since it also considered my dad’s income (since he’s the co-signer).

ekowm3|2020-01-06 04:38:01|Life Insurance for Kids?|"I have a question for the sub related to insurance, investments, and savings...

We’ve been discussing insurance options with our agent, and one of the questions at hand is what, if any, life insurance we’d like to have for our daughter (5yo)...

The one we’re considering is a “buy-20” product that has a death benefit of 50k with an out of pocket cost of $480/yr or ~$8k for a one time payment. We (her parents) would be the beneficiaries until she is older, at which point we’d assign it over to her. At that point, it also will have a cash out value greater than the cost of the product, tho not much. 

We’ve been putting bday $, alaska pfd’s, and $50/mo into a low interest savings account, so she has ~$11k sitting in her account right now, but her interest accrual is abysmal (~$7.00/mo). 

So, I’m torn about which path to choose. I think having some insurance on the kiddo is good, especially that in her adult years it will give her the ability to have a death benefit go to her future family. As I’m trying to boil it down, I think my questions are thus:

-	50k or 100k? (assumes quoted premiums above are doubled for the 100k option). 

-	Annual premiums or one-time premium? If one-time, it would seem that $50k would be the amt. 

-	And the last one I think I’m just frozen with option paralyzation: insurance vs investment (and which investment!?) 

I’d love to hear your story about having additional insurance that your parents offered you and how it’s helped, and also stories about how you’re protecting your kiddos.

ekr3nx|2020-01-06 08:12:27|Credit report does not match score (Transunion)|"I’ve been trying to figure out an issue with Transunion for a while. My Equifax and Experian scores are both around ~810 but my Transunion is a 741. I had a chapter 7 bankruptcy over 10 years ago. 

I have various credit cards that give me free credit reporting and they all seem to match up but I did notice the Capital One report mentioned my score was low due to a bankruptcy but all the credit “factors” they had summarized showed no issues. However, when I dug into Transunion’s report on Capital one it shows my Honda Finance as closed / derogatory (it was during bankruptcy but I did a reconfirmation of debt and never missed a payment for the life of the loan). I disputed with Transunion but they said they don’t have a payment history for that account (it was closed 9 years ago).

So today, I downloaded my credit reports directly from each agency. None of them show anything derogatory and Experian/Equifax show no missed payment for that Honda Finance. Transunion shows no payment history but the account status shows “closed - paid in full” which is not the same as Capital One’s Transunion data which says “Closed - Derogatory”.

I decide to pay the $10 to get my Transunion score directly from Transunion. It’s a 741 - nothing derogatory. When I click on their score “advice” it says I have a bankruptcy on my report. Under the public records field etc there is no mention of bankruptcy. 

I can only dispute individual entries not the score calculation itself. I’m planning to call them tomorrow but I’m not sure how well that will go.

My current theory is still related to that Honda Finance account. Transunion has a remarks field that says “ch7 reconfirmation of debt”. The account was closed 9 years ago - but the remark says it was a reconfirmation of debt. Is the credit score algorithm using the remarks field to say I have a bankruptcy on my report? If a bankruptcy is more than 10 years old but an account was modified because of it and closed after the bankruptcy - can it still haunt me?? I paid every single payment for that account on time even during the bankruptcy process. There’s nothing else on my report that has anything on it - all the 3 agencies have the same data - except for the Honda finance remarks field.

Any other thoughts to this are welcome. But this is pretty much set in stone for me because I have no other debts/financial stressors. 

-$5000 in a mutual fund for my daughter’s college/life(my mom also is adding $10K to this) so it will grow to be a good size by the time she is 18 years old. 

-$3000 cash aside for serious emergencies. 

-$10,000 in an investment account for myself. (Goal is to have a down payment on a house in a couple years) 

That leaves me with $13,000 to have some fun with. 

After making a list of stuff that I want(off-road modifications for my truck, new clothes, some clothes and baby stuff for my daughter, camping equipment, and a new espresso machine, I’m left with $3000. That will get added to my savings account. 


Does this sound like a good idea? After paying off the debt, and buying some nice stuff I’ve always wanted(but never been able to afford, like modifications for my truck), I figure most of it should be put away for savings for myself and daughter. 

TLDR: 
-$50k inheritance
-$17k towards debt 
-$16k in investments/savings
-$5k in daughters college/etc. fund 
-$10k fun for me :) 
Thoughts? Advice? 

I know $50k is a lot of money but it isn’t a TON of money, I just want to be reasonably wise with it. If this is stupid all together, please try to be nice. I’m just trying to make the best plan for myself and my daughter."|ibarney64|False|https://redd.it/ekqov2|1|0.6|0|13|1|personalfinance
ekh7go|2020-01-05 18:53:31|Health insurance denied out of network claim for emergency service, anything I can do?|"When I gave birth to my son at a hospital he needed to be transferred to another hospital's NICU. This involved an ambulance ride. The ambulance ride was out of network. My insurance payed ~$600 but the total bill was for ~$2000. The ambulance company now wants me to pay the remainder ~$1400. 

I noticed on the bill from the ambulance company it lists the transport as ""non-emergency"". I'm not an expert on medical billing obviously, but it feels like this was an emergency? The doctors at the time basically said we need to send the baby to other hospital as that hospital is setup to deal with baby's condition. 

I got a letter from my insurance company saying that they tried to negotiate with ambulance company but were unsuccessful. I have not yet directly spoken to anyone about the bills. If it matters I hit my out-of-pocket maximum for the year. I believe the issue with the insurance paying is that the company was out-of-network, despite both hospitals being in-network.

Is there anything I can do? Should I try to get the insurance company to pay? Ambulance to drop the charge? Or am I just stuck paying for it?"|insurance32342|False|https://redd.it/ekh7go|11|0.75|0|13|1|personalfinance

22M. Single, no kids. $75000 a year plus bonus (about 6500 or so). About 27000 in a Roth 401k, 1500 in liquid savings, and 20000 in a mutual fund I’ve been contributing to for a while.

Rent: $1150/month⁣, 401k contribution (after tax): 1000 dollars/ month Car Loan: $460/month (~$10,000 left)⁣, Insurance: $250/month (car, renters, and health)⁣, Cell phone: $80/month⁣ Utility: ~$100/month⁣ total.

I don’t have any other debt besides my car loan. When it’s all said and done if I try really hard to limit my spending I can save about 800 dollars / month or so. I recently went on an overseas trip with my family which cleared out a lot of my savings.

I’m thinking about paying off my car loan so I don’t have any more debt with the money I have in my mutual fund. However, I was really hoping that money would eventually be used on a down payment for a house (maybe even potentially buying this summer when my lease expires if the market is right). So right now I feel like I have a few options and I’m not sure which one to take:

1) leave the money in the mutual fund, pay off car loan (2 years left of payments at 2.99% interest) as normal

2) pull enough money out of mutual funds to pay off car loan now. Leave the rest in the fund

3) close mutual fund account and take all the money out. Pay off car loan and save money like crazy for a down payment on a house. If the market is right next summer then buy but if not rent another year.

I’m not really sure what to do with the stock market being what it is and my parents always taught me that having any kind of debt is bad news. Any thoughts would be appreciated!"|ysuia|False|https://redd.it/ekitom|6|0.7|0|10|1|personalfinance

However, i've noticed i CANT spend my money, not that i have loads anyway.

If i were to calculate all my spending in a month, it would only consist of food, haircut, and gas. nothing else. I was raised in a frugal home since we come from a poor country. So it's stuck in my head and i don't know how to spend my money. Anytime i see something i love, i always find a way to talk myself out of it. 

For example, i'm a huge tech guy, i have a nice setup with my own built PC that i've had since i was 16, but i can't get myself to upgrade my PC, or buy my own TV for my room, so i'm stuck with this 720p 30 inch monster. But no matter how badly i want something new, i always just convince myself i dont really need it, so i never get anything.

Is this healthy? should i just never spend unless i really need it, like a haircut or just basic necessities? or is it good to spend money?

I'd been using the account debit card to pay medical bills.  He said I should use my credit card (to get cash back) and that for each distribution I need to save the receipt.  I don't have the receipts, but all the distributions were to so-and-so dentist/doctor/hospital via the card.  Hopefully I'm not screwed if audited...


I started looking and can't find great detail on this issue.  I'm thinking of the following procedure looking forward.

1. Pay with credit card (get cash back)

2. Do bank transfer from HSA to savings account

3. Scan bill matching transfer amount and save to <exact location to be determined, Google Drive?>.


Questions:

1. Is the above legally sufficient?

2. Is there a good place / tool people use to store the receipts?


Some extra detail.  We're putting about 2x annual expenses into the HSA (basically maxing) each year.  Using some short term and investing the rest.

ekqh5a|2020-01-06 07:05:47|Looking to finance or lease new car with husband, need advice|"So, basically the title. My husband and I are looking to buy a new car. We’re recently married and he sold his car before enlisting in the military, so we only have my car to rely on, but she’s really up there in miles and the amount of money we’ve poured into her almost matches what she’s worth so we figure it’s about time to move on. We’re getting ready to move to his first duty station and our first home together and we’re looking to finance or lease a new car together, our first “family” car, if you will. 
Realistically, we only need one car, as he plans to bike or walk to work most of the time, so to us it kind of made sense to us that a lease would work best since we wouldn’t be doing a lot of high mileage traveling. I’d be doing most of the driving but we’re going to be in a small town so I don’t expect a commute more than 15 minutes. We had an issue when we went to a car dealership in our hometown because they had a really great lease deal going on (turns out it’s known to be shady, even beyond the red flags we saw) and they pulled our credit. I have the necessary credit for a decent lease, but despite my husband having credit cards and good credit history, his came up as “ghost” or no credit, which was weird. Is that normal? Or can I just tack that on to the list of shady things this dealership did (we obviously left but not prior to them pulling our credit). Would it be better for us to keep the car in my name once we go to a more reputable dealership? 
We had also considered the idea of financing a newer used car. Would it be more worthwhile to go this route despite the monthly payments seeming to be higher? We live a very frugal lifestyle as it is, but not out of necessity. We just don’t require much to be happy and after growing up watching family members make poor financial choices, we both fear ending up in situations like we’ve seen our families in and higher monthly payments on something like this gives us the heebiejeebies . We’re very appreciative of any advice you friendly folks here have for us as we really don’t have the best financial role models to turn to :)"|perpetuallyconfusedt|False|https://redd.it/ekqh5a|0|0.5|0|12|1|personalfinance

eknsfv|2020-01-06 03:04:28|Why is it worse to borrow from your 401k instead of from a bank?|"It's common wisdom that it's bad to borrow from your 401k. I think I agree with this. At the same time, I think it is actually a logical fallacy that goes against even more conventional wisdom -- never borrow money to invest in the stock market.

Investopedia lists [8 reasons why it's bad to borrow form your 401k](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/06/eightreasons401k.asp).

The main takeaway is that you're borrowing pre-tax dollars, and there's an opportunity cost. This is all true. There's also an opportunity cost NOT to borrow from the bank and invest in the stock market. This is understood to not be worth it for the vast majority of people.

I get it that there's a difference between investing money that you do have vs investing money that you don't have. In one case, you can only lose your own money. In the other case, you can get into debt. Some would argue one case is better than the other.

But this is really a different case. Traditionally, people borrow from their 401k for a down payment on a home. Usually, you have more money in your 401k than you borrow.

Assume you have $100k in your 401k, and you want to borrow $50k for your down payment.

In this particular case, I don't see what the difference is between borrowing $50k from the bank to invest in the stock market vs borrowing from your 401k. In each case, they have the exact same opportunity cost!

If you borrow $50k from your 401k for a down payment on your house, and the stock market goes up 20%, you miss out on $10k of stock gains. Assuming a 5% APR, you pay about $2.5k in interest. This is a cost of $7.5k.

Now assume that you do nothing. You leave the $100k in 401k. You borrow an additional $50k for your house. Obviously the APR will be slightly different, but lets assume it's the same. Your 401k is now up to $120k, but you had to pay an extra $2.5k in interest. You come out ahead $17.5k.

This appears to be a better option -- by $25k! It's substantial.

But in the same conditions, it also appears to be a better option to borrow an extra $50k from the bank and stick it in the stock market. The opportunity cost of that is $7.5k -- exactly the same as borrowing from 401k!

The problem is, even though your retirement is supposed to average an 8% return, you never really know what's going to happen in a given year. If the market drops 40%, it would have been a great idea to borrow from your 401k! But you don't know what the market is going to do.

I actually agree with this advice. I think it's more because of psychology / loss aversion than because it's sound advice.

I'm probably missing something, though. Can anyone explain it?"|onlyrealcuzzo|False|https://redd.it/eknsfv|2|0.63|0|17|1|personalfinance

I only work part time at the university, and I make $780 a month. My partner is working full time and is in school finishing up his bachelors. He makes about $2000 a month post tax and post all his personal bills (car insurance, phone bill etc.) but pre living expenses. My grandparents also give us $800 a month to contribute to our living expenses. This brings our total income to $3580 post tax. 

My partner and I budget about $1800 a month for ALL living expenses, groceries, and other bills we have together, and there is always leftover money at the end of the month so we put it in a savings account that belongs to my partner and me. This will go toward a downpayment on a home in the future. 

Of that $1800, I contribute another $250 along with the $800 for the rest of the living expenses. My partner usually offers to contribute more so I don’t have to contribute as much. But it’s really important to me that I contribute what I can, but it’s good to know that if something happened to my measly $250, my partner could help me out with my share. 

$1,580 (my total post tax income)
- $1,050 for living expenses 

= $530 left over

I don’t have to pay for health insurance yet, and I don’t have to pay for car insurance. I have a big family, so my share of the phone bill is very low. My dad pays for all of this for me and my siblings. 

I pay for the gas for my car, and copays for all doctors visits or prescriptions. If I were in a car accident I would pay my deductible. 

Besides the holidays, that money usually gets spent on lunch, or late night dinner, gas, and the occasional coffee or happy hour drink. I am trying to transition my wardrobe to have quality clothes that will last, so I right now am spending an additional $80 a month on clothes, but I feel like I’m almost done rebuilding my wardrobe. Sometimes my partner and I will go in on something for the apartment, but that’s mostly been his domaine. 

In my savings account I have $3,600. I put about $60 in a month, but I recently had to take from out to pay my share of the bills (because I’m a part time employee and the university is closed for 2 weeks, so I went 2 weeks without pay), and given the fact that it was Christmas. It was a lot for me to handle without going into my savings. It’s not that I didn’t have money for my bills, or Christmas presents but that was a lot for me to pay out of just my checking account. 

When I set up my checking account as a 14 year old my dad made it a joint account. He is still on the account and sees all my money. I put literally everything on a credit card that only I can see because I don’t want him to see how much I spent on happy hour or whatever (I have never had a problem paying my credit card off on time though. I tend to pay it every 2 or 3 days). In the past he as got on me for being irresponsible with my money because he saw I spent money at a clothing store/coffee shop/whatever. Now I’m 24 and he’s still on there. And it feels humiliating. The reason I’m including this because I feel very anxious of my checking account balance drops below $200 because he can see that I’m low on money. I try to treat my bank account like if I have $250 in checking, I only have $50 in checking. I have yet to ask him to remove himself from my account because of how much he helps me. He offers to pay for all of these things, and he gets mad when I try to contribute to my car insurance, but then he tells me I should be better with money, and that I spend too much. 

I feel incredibly ashamed typing this out. Anytime money is brought up I feel sick to my stomach. So much so I’m terrified of opening the Wells Fargo app to look at my balances. 

I’d like to see myself double my contributions to my personal savings account but I have a really hard time transferring that money to an account for some reason. I am not contributing as much to my savings, even though I know deep down that that money is still mine, it just feels like I might need that money, and if I put it in a savings account it’s gone. 

I guess I’m wondering how I’m actually doing. My dad would obviously look at this and think I was irresponsible (and who knows, maybe he’s right). My mom would see this and think that I was Dave Ramsey’s protege lol. 

And I am also asking for tips from anyone else that deals with bad attitudes around money, especially if you got them from your parents.

Tl;dr: my parents had weird and conflicting attitudes about money. While I’m working to overcome that, I want to make sure that I’ve got an least some what level head when it comes to my finances."|not-brooke|False|https://redd.it/ekpc23|1|1.0|0|1|1|personalfinance

ekgwsm|2020-01-05 18:32:39|Help me figure out what to do with an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), if anything|"So some quick background: I (32M) just started a new position with a bank, and they offer an ESPP, which I have never been offered before. This is also a new career path for me, which came with a voluntary significant pay cut, so I'm kind of in new territory all around. I am making ~$50k. I will be contributing at least 6% to 401k to get my full company match, but will likely bump to 10% ultimately. The ESPP matches contributions at 15%. This is a top 20 bank.

My initial thoughts are to do a little (2%-5%) in the ESPP, and sell at year end if it's at or above my average, to lock in 15% gains minus gains tax. If the stock is below my average, I can keep buying in and lowering average. Then, I can use the money to fund other accounts (i.e. IRA, savings). 

My questions/concerns: If I'm not able to fully fund 401k, should I even consider the ESPP, or put all I can in to 401k? Is 15% worth it, after taxes are taken in to account? Since it is financial institution, I am slightly concerned that some Democratic presidential candidates are very ""anti-bank"", and could hurt the stock (and potentially my employment) in the future.

ekp4p9|2020-01-06 04:57:34|My personal budget methodology.|"I think the way I do my monthly budget is very different from most people I read about and just wanted to share. 
This works very well for me. 
My description here is a bit simplified from what I actually do, but the main approach is the same. 
(Ps, I am a CPA)
—
I make a money budget of:
1) income (both paychecks), 

2)fixed expenses (listed out for everything that is a reoccurring change - rent, electric, phone) ... these are things that you do not have short term control over. 

3) variable expense (things I do have control over) - food, entertainment, gas. 

*** I do not budget savings as a separate item. Savings is the remainder. I “plug” total variable expenses such that the remainder is my savings target. for example: income - fixed expenses - variable expenses = $500. Therefore my “target” savings would be $500. (This can either go into a savings/investment account or can be used for big non-monthly expenses like the Vet for my dog or holidays etc. )

I have a spreadsheet that tracks the balance of all my accounts at the start of each month and the a second ”compare” column for when I update to check month-to-date changes. You need to track all of your accounts - bank accounts, credit cards, savings accounts, investment accounts etc)
I have a formula that does (day of the month / total variable expenses) - this calculates how much I should have spent X days through the month. 
For example my full month variable expenses are 900 (30 per day) ... on the 15th day of the month my “budgeted variable expenses” = $450. 
Excel does this calculation automatically. 

Then whenever I want to check the budget during the month, all I do is update my account balances. They get compared to the beginning of the month to calculate “month to date” change. Then plug in which of your fixed expenses have been paid so far for the month, and plug in the paychecks you received. The remainder is “actual variable expenses” month do date. 

Then I compare budgeted month to date vs actual month to date variable expenses. this lets me know if I’m on track, ahead or behind for the month. Then I can adjust how much I am spending on variable expenses. If I’m behind budget, I’ll try to spend less. If I am ahead, I’ll treat myself. 

—

The key thing that I believe differentiates my method is that I don’t need to track *what* I spend the money on. Just the balances. 
Updating the budget takes 20 minutes at the start of the month and then 5-10 minutes whenever I want to check my progress. 
The only time I investigate is when the budget vs actual variance is very large (then I say “what did I spend my money on?!)

It also helps me keep a close eye on when minimum payments are due, etc. 

I usually update once per weekend. 

—

Doing it this way, if you hit your variable expense budget on the last day of the month, then your bank account should be increased by the “Target remainder” amount from your monthly budget - aka your monthly savings. 

—

The only thing that complicates this is non-monthly expenses (holiday spending, vacations, annual expenses like a Costco membership)
I have to estimate those once per year and back them out of the monthly calculation. (These either reduce the “remainder” of the money budget or decrease the balance of the bank account /increase the credit card balance.)"|ultra-rooster|False|https://redd.it/ekp4p9|0|0.33|0|3|1|personalfinance
ekhhxt|2020-01-05 19:13:34|Filing taxes when overcontributed to HSA (have gotten refund of excess contributions)|"I switched jobs this year and accidentally contributed a couple hundred dollars over the maximum allowed to HSA accounts due to confusion about whether employer contributions counted towards the max.  My HSA contributions are deducted pre tax from my paycheck.  I filled out a form with my current HSA account manager and they sent me a check refunding me the excess contribution.  I presumably need to pay taxes on this amount though.  Is there a certain form I need to fill out with my taxes so that this is reflected as income that needs to be taxed?

Also, I see some info online about needing to have my employer send me an updated W2 if they show all the contributions before deducting the excess.  Is this correct?  Presumably they won't change what was withheld for 2019 but I guess that could fix my displayed earned income on my W2 so that the extra money isn't subtracted?

Edit:

Some information seems to here:

https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8889.pdf

But I am confused about where to report the refunded amount, still.  It's clear that any interest (there is none) goes into ""other income"" but what about the amount itself?  Do I just add it to my earned income or need to get a fixed W2?

It's this line on page 5 that's unclear to me: ""You do not claim a deduction for the amount of the withdrawn contributions""

I know paying extra money to these loans will lead to less interest over time, guaranteed rate of return, and more money saved down the road, but would you put this in the ""saving for retirement"" category or does this come out of another bucket (like the 30% discretionary pile in 50/30/20)?

Marriage isn’t on the table right now. just talking cohabitation at this point. We each have one child. Hers lives full time with her.  Mine splits time between my ex wife and I. Relationship stuff aside, I’m trying to figure out the financial side of it all. 

She rents a house and currently pays a little over $800 a month not including utilities. Her lease ends in May. 

I have 90k left to pay on my mortgage. Current monthly payment is $508.  Current house value is ~190k. 

What I don’t want to do is get into any legal entanglements where she has a case for partial ownership of the house if things go south.   I also don’t want and can’t afford to be her “sugar daddy”. 

I’m a good bit older than her and we are in different financial stages of our life. Other than the mortgage, I’m debt free.  She on the other hand has 73k in outstanding debt (most of that is student loans), no savings, and lives paycheck to paycheck. To be honest this is my biggest hang up with moving in together and I’m thinking really hard about it. 

But back on point, I’ve been mulling over a “landlord/tenant” type arrangement that looks something like she pays me $400 a month rent, we split utilities and I’m responsible for maintenance/upkeep/insurance on the house (like I’m due for a new roof soonish). 

On the one hand, do I look like an asshole for charging $400 when my mortgage is $500?  I get how that could look. But if I were to rent out the house I could expect something like $1200 to $1400 a month I think. The 3 bedroom house across the street rents for $1200. Mine is a 4 bedroom. 


On the other, I would basically be helping her cut her expenses in half and hopefully start helping her on a path to get her financial life in better shape.

ekoeqy|2020-01-06 03:54:47|How can I financially support my severely mentally ill mother in-law without bankrupting my family?|"Hey everyone! I'm a longtime lurker on this subreddit but this is my first time posting. 

My wife, father-in-law, and I are desperate for help but have no idea where to even start. I've always seen great advice given here so I figured I'd give it a shot. If anyone has any suggestions on other subs that might be better for this situation, I'd love your suggestions there as well!

Here's the situation...

We live in California (Bay Area) and my in-laws hold dual citizenship in the USA and Taiwan.

As the title suggests, my mother-in-law is severely mentally ill. She's physically and emotionally abusive to my father-in-law, and we've finally convinced him that they need to separate for his own well being. He has worked hard his entire life and had quite a successful career, but his wife has mostly squandered away all of their money and he's left without much cash savings, but they do own 2 houses. The houses are in both of their names.

He is an extremely admirable dude and, despite his wife abusing him for so long, really his main concern is finding a way to support her that prevents her from blowing all of their retirement money once he retires fully in a few years. We want to find a way where she can get a monthly allowance from a fund that she technically owns, but can't spend more than her monthly allowance. She would NEVER agree to something like this. 

The other issue is that they don't have enough cash to retire without selling at least 1 of the homes. But, we can't convince her to sell the homes because she seems to think it's some plot against her. She really can't comprehend that the money to keep living her lavish lifestyle just isn't there anymore.

So my 2 questions are:

1) What financial products, if any, could we set up to get his this type of allowance...knowing that it will be against her will.

2) Is there any way to force the sale of one of their homes against her will? They won't be able to continue paying both mortgages, but we absolutely don't want this to end in foreclosure.

TL;DR - Mother in law is crazy and abusive, squandered all of their retirement savings, and we need a way to support her while protecting her against herself. In order to do so, need to sell a house against her will. Help!"|JorgeJungle|False|https://redd.it/ekoeqy|1|0.57|0|2|1|personalfinance

eko5wo|2020-01-06 03:34:24|I might not be able to go back to school|"English is not my first language.

To get straight to the point, I (M18) have no idea how I’m going to pay for school, and I might not be able to go back this spring semester.

The college that I attend, like most, require you to pay for each semester at the end and blocks you from beginning a new semester until the bill of the previous is paid off. My mom and my older brother who are the providers for the household of 4, helped me and pay for the first year, which they were barely able to do. I just completed my 2019 fall semester and we were unable to come up with enough to pay off the bill, thus I will not be able to go back for this (2020 spring) semester.

We looked everywhere for a solution. My mom picked up a second job, I got a job myself for the first year of college and my older brother is also working ( I previously mentioned household of 4; my little brother is in high school). 

I took advantage of all the opportunities the state (NY) and government provided like FAFSA, HESC, TAP, etc. I signed up for tons of scholarships and aides. I got a few that help a lot but even then we could not come up with the rest of the balance. 

I spoke to advisement at my school and like always they give you those rehearsed, robotic, unhelpful responses. I basically reached out to everyone in my network, financial aid office, family, friends, etc anyone who can give me advice on my situation. 

To be completely transparent, I’ll admit there is one thing I did not try (sort of) which most other college students do which is take out a loan. I do not have a credit and my mom’s is not very good. Furthermore having a lot of loans to payback at the end of college is a nightmare for me. And if my mom was somehow able to plea with the bank/school to get a loan it would probably be a horrible interest rate which is just going to put us in more debt in a few years, especially because my little brother will begin college In two years and will have to go through the same thing if we can’t find a solution.

So… I’m asking to anyone who as ANY tips, ANY advise, ANY recommendations no matter how small or negligible you think it might be please tell me. It could help keep in school. Any service you know of, any scholarship, and anywhere to find a helping hand and just share it with me. This is basically my last place to look for help.


Edit : I attend a state school. And community college would have been a good idea but I already have 1 1/2 years completed so it doesn’t make sense to switch to a community college for 1 semester then switch back. Moving off campus is one of the biggest topics my family is discussing, it’s not a clear fix because we would have to come up with a rent for the house and another rent for me at college each month which is still difficult. Books, and supplies your come up to $600/$700 at most. Oh and I’m a computer science major."|TheRealAcSavage|False|https://redd.it/eko5wo|0|0.5|0|8|1|personalfinance

ekl5n0|2020-01-05 23:43:15|Student Loans - best way to take advantage of repaye?|"Does anyone know if the following is allowed by fedloan?

I have \~180k in student loans, I am in REPAYE, and my minimum payment is approx $280/month (withdrawn automatically). My loans generate about $800 in interest per month, so after my $280 payment, there is $520 left generated per month, and with REPAYE the government forgives roughly half of this, so I get $260 forgiveness, and $260 for my final interest generated per month.

I noticed on the fedloan website that I can suspend my automatic payments and instead choose to pay it every month on the website, and when you do that you can specify how much money goes toward each loan. One of my loans is \~40k and has the highest interest rate out of all my loans, 6.5%. My question is, can I just take my $280/month minimum payment and put all of it toward this loan with the highest interest rate and still get the government forgiveness of half my remaining interest generated on loans for that month? So I would pay $280 to the high interest 40k loan (which creates $216/month interest), and then the remaining $64 would go towards paying down the principal on that loan. Then there would be $584 left in interest generated per month from other loans, and REPAYE would forgive half of this and result in $292 forgiveness, and $292 for my final interest generated per month. This way would end up netting me better bang for my buck in my $280 payment because my $64 toward principal would make up for the extra $32 in final interest generated per month from the other loans, netting me essentially a free $32 monthly principal payment on my highest interest loan compared with my current payment structure in the first paragraph.

My concern is that this may not be allowable, or because no payment was made to the interest on the other loans, that REPAYE might not forgive half the interest generated that month on those loans, which would put me in a worse situation because then I wouldn't be receiving any forgiveness of my interest generated. My income will be going up significantly in approximately 2 years, at which point I won't be eligible for any interest forgiveness through REPAYE, so my main goal is to get as much interest forgiveness as I can, while I can.

I was wondering if anyone has had good, bad, or any experience with any of these apps - and which is best. I don’t have hours a day to trade stocks. I’m looking to be able to toss a few dollars here and there into it and hopefully have a decent return either quickly, or long term.

I think his credit score is around 650-700. We both work in IT and make decent money. His general plan was to keep paying like this and breaking even until he gets a better job and can pay it off faster. He says he's not able to just ask them to get on some kind of payment plan with reduced interest. I'm not super financially literate, but I'm finding it kind of hard to beleive that the credit card companies won't work with him. If it wasn't for the interest, it would be paid off already. Fronting some money might be an option for me, but not trying to pay nearly half this amount.

So if he tried contacting the credit card companys to work out something better, does anyone know if they would actually do that? Are there any resources that he might have missed?

I understand that I may get 0% apr, or a low apr for a period of time, then it switches to a very high apr.

I finished my student loans off just a few weeks ago. My employer gave me my annual bonus, $20k, as a lump sum payment into the SEP-IRA, which is set up with Fidelity. Now I have that $20k sitting in Fidelity, but am unsure where to deploy it.

I have two primary concerns.

(1) I know the default idea is something like a Target Date fund with low expenses. But I am anxious about investing such a large lump sum, all at once, at historic market highs. I know no one can time the market, but...

(2) I am shopping around as a first-time homebuyer and would like to use $10k from the IRA for that - in about 7-8 months.

Maybe a 6-month CD?"|jaqen16|False|https://redd.it/ekitg2|3|0.72|0|3|1|personalfinance
ekhgf8|2020-01-05 19:10:47|Buying 2nd house - Our dream/forever home|"Hi everyone, looking for some insight/advice on buying a bigger house and keeping our current one to use as a rental.

Our situation: My wife and I are both 30, just had a baby and plan to have another in a year or two, I am also a veteran and currently using a VA loan for our current house and plan to use it for the second. Below is current income/expenses.

Income: Just over 8k/month after taxes/deductions(wife works part time, will go up to 10k when she goes back to full time, not 100% sure when that is, but if money got tight she go back to full time, right now just more time with baby.

Current Mortgage: 1600/month with insurance and taxes, currently paying 2k a month
Car Payment: 410/month, paying 500 a month

Roth IRA's - 1000/month, maxing out for each of us
529 - 100/month
401k - My wife puts in the max her employer matches, 5%
Pension - I have a pension through work which will likely be about $60k a year once I retire in 25-30 years.

Bills - $727/month, this includes, auto, umbrella policy, life insurance, utilities, and our streaming services.
CC - 1500/month on our credit card - this includes groceries and gas, but also quality of life purchases which we can cut down if needed. Could likely push this down to about 1000/month if we had to. We pay our CC's in full every 2 weeks.

Each month we normally throw about 2500 (give er take on our CC spending) into our savings that we plan on using as a down payment on our next house, currently have 50k saved up. 20k of that is our 6 month emergency fund.

The house we are in now is too small for a family and we are ready to get our dream/forever home. We are very interested in being landlords and renting out our current residence. We can easily get 1700/month, would likely ask for 1800-1900 at first depending on what else is on the market.

Talking with my lender, he says buying a 650k house will give us an estimated payment of 3400 with insurance and taxes. If we are breaking even on our first house, we will barely be scraping by if we continue to max out our roths. Is it worth it if we are in our dream house with our perfect yard and perfect location? Both my wife and I have jobs that provide us with 2.5%-5% COLA raises each year and after we buy this house we don't foresee any future large debt obligations so it seems like it might be okay to be tight for a year or two until we are saving a couple grand each month after maxing out our roths. Or we could take a year or two off from contributing to our roths to alleviate some pressure?

Other things worth noting, I work for the city utility company and my wife is a nurse, we are in the greater Seattle area which is why the prices are fairly high and since I work in Seattle this dream home cuts my commute in half, currently 3-4 hours of transit each day. We feel our jobs are fairly full proof since I can't imagine people not wanting healthcare or electricity and we both are doing well at our jobs. But we still plan to have our emergency fund capable of paying for both houses for at least 3 months(6 ideally) before we throw any money towards the new house.

If things did go miserably we could always sell our first house and pocket the 60k in equity we have. We are not very interested in using that money for a down payment on the second house since it only reduces the monthly payment by about 300$ and our month to month would still be tight, it sounds like it would be better as a cushion/emergency fund.

We know this isn't going to happen today but hopefully this summer, but might end up waiting longer if we have to. Any insight is much appreciated!"|GeraltofSparta|False|https://redd.it/ekhgf8|6|0.6|0|58|1|personalfinance

The employee ensured me that that was okay but because we booked through Expedia, we would need to call them. I did, but the Expedia servers were down.

The next day, we checked out and the employee ensured me again that they'll work with Expedia. Unfortunately, I didn't get their names. We left the hotel and went to another one.

After not recieving any news from Expedia, I called them again, and this time the hotel was either not picking up or saying that the manager isn't around.

It is that time of the year where I start getting all my tax documents in order, and I am hoping someone might help clarify a question I have about taxes on grants.

I received a small grant ($3,000) to fund my research for my dissertation. When googling, I found a bunch of websites, like H&R Block, that seem to suggest I do not need to pay taxes on this as it was given to me for research and not for the benefit of the grantor. I'm not ""working"" for anyone. It was just a ""hey, your work is cool; here's money so you can keep doing it"" type of thing.

The IRS website is, quite frankly, confusing as it seems more geared towards undergraduates than grad students. My research, for example, is not for a grantor or a professor. It is required for me to graduate as I need to do research to write my dissertation. However, it isn't a ""class"" (though I do register for a course for dissertation writing).

I asked a CPA years ago about a similar, but much larger, scholarship and his advice was that these scholarships are not tax-able, but that even if they were, the IRS would never check for them. It didn't give me the most confidence in his answer.

I know it won't be reported on my W-2 at the end of the year, so I think that might mean it is meant to be tax free, but idk.

I’m young and am looking to maximize my investments and retirement accounts, going towards leanFIRE.

Bank: Am currently a BoA customer for my basic banking needs, mostly just keep my emergency fund there since most of my cash goes into funding retirement accounts and investments.

Credit Cards: I use my BoA cash rewards card for most purchases, although I’m a frugal person living at home so I dont have many expenses. I order most items on amazon, no Amazon prime though so not interested in the Amazon card. I get all my gas at Costco so the Costco Citibank Visa Card for the 4% cash back on gas seems nice but the rewards thing being limited to February and expiring in December seems like a major hassle so I dunno about this for now. If I consolidate everything to BoA/ME, I could probably reach platinum/platinum honors tier preferred rewards which looks nice but like I mentioned, I don’t make a lot of purchases so the value of a potential 5.25% cash back is questionable to me if I could take advantage of other bank/broker rewards programs for having my IRAs and investment totals with them.

IRA: My current IRA is with Vanguard in index ETFs, I usually max out my years contribution buying more shares at the start of a year.

Investments: I have some crypto in coinbase, some stocks with TD Ameritrade while most of my stocks and some crypto are in Robinhood that I occasionally trade. Robinhood's upcoming cash management and fractional shares seem appealing for me to keep some more cash in there. Now that most if not all the major brokers are doing away with commission fees, I’m wondering about benefits I could get from other brokers.

From the bit of research I’ve done I’m currently looking towards moving my IRA and investments to a new Merrill Edge account to take advantage of their preferred rewards program, leaving my emergency fund with BoA and keeping play money in Robinhood but I’m just wondering if there’s other factors to consider or better banks/brokers."|Throwaway8364032|False|https://redd.it/ekiqf5|3|1.0|0|1|1|personalfinance

eknajs|2020-01-06 02:25:17|"Interesting ""student"" loan situation. how to set myself up for the future"|"Hello all,

Background:

\- 22 years old  
\- Salary: 60K (possible 70K with overtime)  
\- no degree  
\- 5K in savings  
\- Only debt is student loans  
\- take home: ($3800) monthly expenses: ($2500)

I have two student loans. One is through FAFSA and the other is directly through the college i went to (only finished 3 years). The one directly through the college has no interest rate but we were able to make an agreement in which I pay $100 every month until the balance hits zero. The other one is a standard student loan with a $95 minimum per month detailed below

\- Direct Subsidized Stafford **$2,974.55 @ 4.410%**   
\- Fixed Direct Subsidized Stafford **$3,006.68 @ 4.040%**   
\- Fixed Direct Unsubsidized Stafford **$1,864.47 @ 4.040%**

\- Balance of payment directly to college: $6300 (No interest) 

Now I understand the no brainer situation here is to pay off the FAFSA loans since they have interest. HOWEVER. I plan on going back to school (this time paid by my employer) however I'm unable to obtain my current transcript on the 3 years completed unless the $6300 is paid in full. Does it still make sense to pay off the non-interest loan in this situation or still go for the one with interest. If I don't I most likely will have to wait an additional 2 years likely once I pay off the $7800. I would like to at least get started on my degree in order to not only have more job security but open up more doors (as a bachelors is almost a baseline requirement these days). My other major concern is having only 5K in savings. Although my job is pretty secure but anything can happen. Knowing I only have 2 months worth of saving makes me sweat a little.

I have used Term4Sale.com as recommended by the wiki to search for policies that mach our needs and specifics but can't seem to find anywhere a description of the differences between very similar policies between or even from within a single company.

For example Massachusetts Mutual offers 2 types of term life insurance plans within New York State named ""Haven Term 30 year (non-ICC)"" or ""Vantage Term 30 (ECP) "".   I can't seem to find any information online about what exactly a ""Haven Term 30 Year"" plan is at all, let alone what non-ICC means. Similarly, I found a PDF ""description' of that Vantage plan that is basically just and advertisement that states its convertible to perminant life insurance (not interested in this) but still no description of what ECP means of really how the insurance works at all. Some even have really confusing statements like ""Term life insurance with level premiums during the initial 30-year period. Premiums increase annually in years 31 and later"". I don't even understand what I means to have a year 31 in a 30 year term life insurance policy. This is true from essentually all the companies I've looked through.

I'm just looking for some help understanding once one knows the exact type and coverage amount how people choose between life insurance companies and ensure they're actually getting what they want.

Bank or owner financing?|"My wife [33F] and I [29M] live in Florida and have rented 1/2 of a two story duplex house for 4 years. The owners live down the street and are retiring/moving out of state in Fall of 2020. They have offered to sell the property to us when they leave. They have offered to do either bank OR owner financing. 

Questions up front:
- Initial research has led me to believe a for sale by owner would be beneficial to us? What’s the downside I’m not considering?
- What’s appropriate for a down payment in a for sale by owner scenario? (We have 50K currently)
- Am I still allowed or should I get a realtor to negotiate in a for sale by owner scenario.
- How do I know what’s fair for interest?

Additional Details:
- We make 175K gross with very stable careers. All joint finances. Wife’s credit is perfect (she rubs that in my face), mine is good. 
- We recently received 50K from a family member.
- We have another 15K in Savings. 
- I contribute 16% to 401K, wife’s at 10%.
- We’re first time home buyers.
- Only debt is 100K left in my wife’s student loans(5.443% interest). We pay 2,500 a month and have a goal to have it paid off by end of 2022.
- We expect the house value is between 400K-525K.
- With two units we can live in one and rent the other for $1100. Current rentor is reliable (old lady).

Disagreement with this subreddit:
I know many in this subreddit will advocates to put the full 50K towards student loans. If we didn’t have an opportunity to buy this house, we would.  But are willing to pay (~7K in student loan interest) for the opportunity to buy the house. Long term I think we will come out ahead.

Additional details on house:
- Tax assessors office has the house at 375K, but our research shows they’re assessments are often ~50K below what houses are going for near us.
- House is a block from the beach in an area that’s rapidly expanding.
- The house does need ~20-30K of work in the next couple of years. The back porch is not structurally sound. The windows leak in big storms. One of two A/C units is hanging on by a thread. 
- The current owners bought the home in 2004.

ekmm7d|2020-01-06 01:32:30|Invest in IRA or keep in savings account? Buying a house.|"Hi! Should I invest the money I have in my savings and brokerage in my traditional IRA, a Solo401k, a SEP or a SIMPLE? Or keep it all in a savings account or brokerage account? I'm want to save on taxes AND be ready to buy a home when the market dips.

I am not squeamish with the market. I have nothing in bonds, am invested in ETFs and some stock. I'm perfectly ok with volatility.  BUT I want to buy my first home when the market dips, which leads me to believe I should keep enough money for a down payment either in savings or bonds. 

I will likely buy a home that is at least $300k (a condo in my HCOL area), and need $60k for a down payment. I'm open to buying something at a higher price if it's a steal. (A close family member is a realtor.) I'm open to putting down more cash, or less cash if I were advised to do one or the other.

This year I made $74k before leaving my job, and made $25k with my business. I already maxed my 401k ($19k) and my Roth IRA ($6k). Tbh, I can't remember why I put the money in a Roth instead of Traditional. My spouse made $80k this year. We've been together 10 years and we happily keep our money separate, invest separately, give our parents money separately, and avoid putting pressure on one another. We file taxes together however. For the purpose of this tax discussion, my spouse has invested $5k in their 401k this year.

I currently have $169k in savings:

Vanguard brokerage - $20k
Vanguard traditional IRA - $50k
Vanguard Roth IRA - $7k
401k from former job, going to roll into Vanguard traditional IRA - $23k
Checking & Savings accounts - $69k

Future-facing info:

I left a high-powered job over the summer and started my own consulting business. I have chronic health issues and find that working part-time for myself gives me more time to focus on my health. So far, I've made an average of $4800/month and I've turned down more projects than I've accepted. 

My goal is to focus on my health and only need to make enough to cover my expenses. My expenses are less than $3k per month.

I want to keep at least 6 months emergency fund of $24k in case I couldn't find work, became fully disabled, or my low-cost housing situation were to change. I do have LTD insurance that I rolled over from a previous job. It is one of the best policies I've seen in terms of scope and cost, and pays out at something like $3k/month. Still, there are a bunch of caveats about qualifying.

I'm 30, no kids, and imagine I'll always work part-time until we can't work anymore, though of course that could change. When I'm not able to work anymore, I plan to retire abroad where I have family and cost of living even with a home healthcare worker would be no more than $20k/year.

ekml1u|2020-01-06 01:30:02|Should I open a Roth IRA when I have a Roth 403b?|"Hi, 

First time posting here, fellow lurker (F34). So I began my financial literacy two years ago and I have been trying to do everything right, amist my situation. The thing is I earn very low for the town I live in. Before taxes, 43,500 and I work in the non-profit sector, with a daughter, as a single mom. The thing is this year I opened my first retirement account. My employer offers 403b plans as a non-profit. I chose a Roth because I am in a low-tax bracket for now. I invest $250 monthly on that account. My employer does not match anything. But I have been reading about the benefits of a Roth IRA. I have different questions regarding this:

1. Should I open a Roth IRA too and contribute to both accounts?
2. Should I stop contributing to the Roth 403b and just contribute to a Roth IRA for now?
3. How does converting my Roth 403b to a Roth IRA work after I leave my job work? Is it a seperate account? And if I have opened an Roth IRA and were contributing to both like the scenario in question 1, when I leave my job would I have two Roth IRA's after conversion or can I put the Roth 403b in the Roth IRA that I opened?

Thanks in advance! 

About my finances: I basically live paycheck to paychek, but I always have 10-15% designated to savings and investments, not counting my retirement account. So far, since I started investing late in the game I have $2500 in a robo-adviser, $1600 as an emergency fund in a HYSavings account and $50 in another HYSavings account for Vacations. I usally have a spare $1000 in my checking account just in case. I am studying to get my license and than apply for a higher paying job. Hopefully by the end of 2020 I will earn more to contribute more in my retirement/investing accounts. I am also working on a writing plan to generate passive income as an author.

ekmeqh|2020-01-06 01:16:46|Why is our credit score system in the US so complicated?|"This will probably sound more like a rant (and honestly it is a bit of a rant), but why is our credit system in this country so complicated? If I want to know my credit score there is literally over 50+ different models that generate a FICO score that can vary by up to 75 points, and even then, it won't really be the ""exact"" score that will be used when I try to apply for a loan/credit card since it just varies so much. And then there's the VantageScore 3.0 which just complicates everything.

It just blows my mind away how inefficient this whole thing is. Is there really no incentive for the credit bureau industry to simplify this and perhaps just have one standard credit score that people can easily look up?

My credit score is usually in the high 700's or low 800's (depending on where I check) so I don't have much to worry when getting credit, but I would still like to better understand how our credit system works.

I'm saving money for a trip this year in October.  While planning this I've run into a few things I just don't know the answer to.  Just for context, I've never been good with money but with the new decade I'm trying much harder to get better at understanding the money I make.

I make 17.50 an hour, Bi-weekly pay, 80 hours of week.  Overtime is time and a half (1.5x) for me.  I had planned to start aiming for 100 hour checks as opposed to 80 hour checks.  I am aware though that making more money means I will have more withheld due to how with holdings work.  The problem I am having is - with the additional money being held from my check, and not receiving those funds until tax time in 2021 - is it worth it to actually pursue the overtime so fiercely.  Is there anyway I can manage my with holdings so that I receive my full overtime ahead of time instead of at the beginning of next year?

My plan was to ride it out for another year or so and buy something a little more practical and comfortable. Then disaster struck, I began hearing this squeaking noise from my clutch pedal.

They also said the clutch pedal assembly will need to be replaced as well.

I know dealers are expensive but I’m afraid the cost of this repair is going to be expensive regardless of who does the work, so I’m toying with the idea of trading in the Subaru and getting a boring automatic sedan but significantly newer with lower miles.

I have a balance of $2400 on a personal loan with a 13.5% interest rate. My account says last year I paid $490 in interest. 

I also have an emergency fund with 2 months expenses currently saved up.

I would really love to pay off my loan as the monthly payments are getting old. To do this, I would only have 1 month expenses left in my emergency fund. It makes me nervous to drain it that low as I've worked really hard to save up to this point. If I worked really hard though on spending less and being more frugal I could probably build it back up to this point again in 3 months without this extra payment.  

I don't have anything in my foreseeable future that could be changing which would make me need to use it. But obviously anything can happen and I'm glad I'm finally prepared for it.

Would it be more responsible of me to pay off the loan or to have a larger amount in my emergency fund?

Since graduating she has been paying for the loans in her name, ~$300 a month, as well as the loans in her parent's name, ~$600 a month. Recently, her parents have been pushing to get the loans into her name and out of their name. Last week her father got in contact with someone from Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, we live in Missouri/Kansas, and this person laid out how all of this would work. First, her father would apply for a loan with her as the co-signer for the amount of the parent plus loan, pay off the parent plus loan, then she would apply for a loan for that same amount and then play off that loan she was a co-signer on. 

This seems sketchy to me. Is this how something like this is normally done? Why a bank in Pennsylvania? Is this new loan in her name still considered a student loan or would it be a personal loan? What my girlfriend would like to do and what I think is the easiest option is to keep it the way it is and just have her continue to make the payment each month but her parents are very persistent to get it out of their name for some reason. They have made some poor financial decisions in the past and I don't want her to get burned for this.

Whats the process for obtaining a car loan through a credit union? I have only been approved for dealer financing prior to this where they handle all the paperwork. I was approved for 20.5k @2.49% which is the purchase price of my car, do I have to go to a branch to pick up a physical check or?

My father is an emotionally and verbally abusive alcoholic and we have an extremely volatile relationship (bordering physical abuse at times\*).  After being away at University I really didn't want to return home and exhausted my network in search of another place to stay for the time being. I had no luck finding an alternative. 

Over the course of the past 8 months, I've landed a full-time job and managed to save roughly $7500 thanks to my mom helping me make student loan payments behind dad's back. I'm currently in therapy & took a job an hour away to make sure I'm out of the house most of the time. 

I'm located in the greater NYC area and make $17/hr.  I have roughly $86k in student loans and a degree in English & Media & Communications. The biggest reason I haven't left home yet are my loan payments - they're about $700/month. Mom is an angel and she's currently paying half. My family has money, but my dad was unwilling to let me go to university. I had $40k+ in scholarships - so please spare me the ""you shouldn't have gone to college"" speech. It got me a job in an industry I wouldn't have otherwise and showed me I can be safe and happy with people who love and validate me. 

Basically, my living situation is undoing all of the mental work I did when I was away from home and I'd like to leave in 3-4 months...I know I'll never be happy if I stay. 

Does anyone else who has been in a similar position have any wisdom to share? How much money should I aim to save and what are my housing alternatives?  Looked at renting with friends, but it was and is not financially possible for them.

\*He knowingly keeps his hands off us because we will get authorities involved. My other family members are unwilling to leave. It's no longer physical and my brother & I are no longer minors, so there isn't much legal intervention available to us anymore.

My common sense + my parents advice says that I should be making extra payments on the principal when I can so that it will be paid off early. When I got down to thinking about it though, I came up with this question. Would it be better for me to make the minimum payment each month and instead of putting in extra money towards the principal, I invest that money for the long terms gains? Basically I’m trying to measure the opportunity cost of paying off the car early vs. investing more money. From everything I’ve read, I can expect an average of 6.6%-7% gains annually (assuming there isn’t a recession, but I’m not here to time the market), as long as my gains outweigh the interest, shouldn’t I be investing my money? Especially considering that I’ve had 16% returns for the last year, which, if I can continue getting returns at anywhere near that pace, would give me a much larger margin between gains and money lost due to interest.

ekgu89|2020-01-05 18:27:31|How should I allocate my money? Debt or investing?|"Hey everyone! 

I've posted a few times on here about my financial situation, but wanted to get some input on what the best use of my money would be in the new year since I have gone through quite a few life changes.

I recently got a new job after being unemployed for around 5 months.

I was able to get a bump in my base salary from $34k to $50k, although I was making about $70k in commission at my previous job, so I easily hit 6 figures. My on target earnings for this year are around $90-100k, but I'm not 100% sure I'll hit that yet. I'm more on track to hit $70-80k unless I have some stellar months. I also had a 401k at my previous employer, but my current employer doesn't offer one. They offer stock options but I won't count them since they haven't vested yet.

My current financial situation is as follows:

**Assets**

* $21,000 in savings
* $13,000 in Roth IRA
* $22,000 in previous employers 401k (can no longer contribute to)
* $1,300 in brokerage account gifted by family

**Expenses**

* $800 in rent
* $45-70 in utilities (internet, gas, electric, water)
* $254 car loan payment, about $10k left at 2.79% (not underwater)
* $104 car insurance payment
* $68 minimum student loan payment
* $65 phone bill
* $14 renters insurance
* \~$1,000 a month on eating out/groceries/entertainment/gas (all charged to my chase credit card)

**Student Loans (\~$12,000 total)**

* $2,000 at 3.15%
* $1,000 at 3.15%
* $1,500 at 3.15%
* $2,800 at 3.15%
* $4,300 at 3.61%

I plan on maxing out my Roth IRA before tax day, which would be an additional $3,500 for 2019. I will move back to DCA for 2020.

I have also been trying to aggressively pay down my student loans with $500 payments every month. I'm not sure if this is the best thing to do financially but I'd like to be debt free ASAP.

I have no major expenses coming up in the near future and plan to continue renting.

My questions are as follows:

1. Is my emergency fund too large?
2. Should I keep a portion of my E-fund in a higher interest investment vehicle like a brokerage account?
3. Is it worth it to pay my student loans off quickly?
4. If it isn't worth it, what should I be doing with the extra money once my Roth is maxed for both 2019 and 2020?

I received my W2 this morning and started filling it out for the Federal piece using TaxAct (I've used for the last decade). TaxAct can't do the State yet but I figured I'd get a head start.

I used standard deductions both years and when I read around this morning it sounds like I should still be able to get up to $2,000 per child.

My sister does not even make $1,000/month, so you can see how that is terrible for her while in school. She recently missed a payment and had her car repossessed.

To ensure she does not get stuck with the loan an no car, my family got approved for a home equity loan. However, the home-equity loan takes thirty days to process, and the car is going to auction on January 13th. To ensure she does not lose the car, my family wants me to take out a $23,000 personal loan. They will pay me back with the home-equity loan.

I am on the edge of telling my family that I cannot do this because my sister already failed out of college with student loans that I co-signed for. I am afraid that something will happen, and I will be stuck with a $23,000 personal loan that I cannot pay for. So, what would you suggest I should do for my sister, my family, and for myself?

I (19F) have been asking this question to myself for months on whether to buy a new phone or not and it's getting annoying and I need some encouragement/advice on the better option. Currently I have the Samsung Galaxy J7 Crown, it is a cheap $100 phone (I didn't have much money and I completely broke my old phone). I have been debating on buying the Iphone 8, 256gb at around $280-300 (it's either this phone or nothing). I do have the money to buy it, I have a couple thousand in the bank through saving money I received for years, but I am looking at the long-term consequences.

My current phone works fine, but its storage is so low (32gb) and I really like to keep the pictures/videos I take on my phone, but I only have 1-2gb space left. It's a little slow cause of the space, but overall it's still works for what I need.

The iphone 8, would have 256gb which would give me enough space for all the pictures and videos, the apps I need, and then some. It also has fingerprint (which I like). It also has facetime/imessage (the read receipts) which is a feature I really like and would like to use with my bf who also has an iphone.

The problem I have is currently I do not have a job, but will be hopefully getting one this year, probably in February. I am currently in community college which is completely free for me, and I will be going to a 4-year university in 1.5 years. University is going to be expensive and I will be going to the same university as my bf and we also plan to live in an apartment. I have almost $3400, $3000 I have stored away for the future for when him and I live in an apartment and go to uni. The rest I need for gas, some necessities, gifts/going out, etc. If I do buy the phone I will have to take $300 from my savings which really bothers me, because I am afraid even if I do get a job I won't be able to recover and advance the savings for the future. What do you guys think ? Am I just being frugal or should I really not buy a phone I don't 100% need ?

ekjc1z|2020-01-05 21:28:55|Which Student Loan Repayment Plan?|"Apologies beforehand if this has been asked before. I looked but did not see it. I went back to graduate school later in life (I’m 33 now). My major was not finance, so this is something I’d like someone else to help answer. I just finished and obviously need to start making payments soon (technically in May, but I want to start now). I took some gambles and have higher than average debt (about $94k, all federal, including accumulated interest), but the job I’ve started pays enough that I’ll be able to pay about $3k every month. I plan on using the avalanche method to target specific loans with the overpayment, and a calculator shows that with the standard ten year repayment plan I’ll be free and clear in less than four years. 

Due to my income, I do not qualify for any income-based repayment plans. However, I noticed a graduated payment plan when I was going over my loan accounts for preparation last night. In this plan, payments start small(ish) and increase every two years. For the first two years, payments are about 60% of the regular plan, and for the last two they’re about 160% of the regular payment. It has the same ten year period as the standard repayment plan. 

Intuitively, it seems like this would be a good option for someone making big overpayments, since it gives me more money (about $400 a month more for the first two years) to send to specific loan accounts, and it’ll be paid off so early I’ll hopefully never see the painfully high payments. However, I’m having a hard time proving it. IS this actually the best way to go about things, or should I stick with the standard repayment plan?

Additional info: I’m contributing to my employer’s 401(k) match and am making max contributions to an IRA. I’m putting a comfortable amount into savings and paying all my other bills. The $3000 payment is doable, but it would require neglecting things I don’t want to neglect to go any higher than that, so I’m going to leave it there for the time being. I also get an annual bonus (the actual amount varies, but historically it’s been 6-10% of salary), of which 50% will go towards the student loans."|ArchitectOfFate|False|https://redd.it/ekjc1z|1|0.66|0|6|1|personalfinance

This time around, I'll most likely use more traditional financing. Ideally, I should be able to get a loan through my credit union. My credit is shot, so my partner will be cosigning. We're in a long term committed relationship, 4 years together, living together for 2, blended finances but separate accounts. 
I should have about $1500 to put down, and I'm aiming for monthly payments of about $150. So, that should put me at a loan amount of about $10k, right? At first, I was thinking that means I can get a $10k car. But after reading some things on here, I don't think that's accurate. For reference, in a perfect world/if I won the lottery, my ""dream"" car is a Buick Encore. Used, those go for like $9k -12k. 

So I have some questions about the process and would appreciate general advise. 
1) Are my numbers here realistic? 
2) I'm worried about dealer's fees and things like that. How much car does a $10k loan actually get me? 
2B) Are dealer's fees rolled into the loan, or do I need more cash on hand then just the down payment? 
3) If I can't get financing through my credit union, how bad of an option is dealer financing? 
4) Are there any good resources for this kind of thing out there that I should know about?

I'm a first-time home buyer with questions about whether to list my fiancee on a home loan application and eventually on the house deed.   I'm hoping you'll all be able to help me understand the costs and benefits of these choices.

**Facts**

My fiancee and I currently rent an apartment in a major city, and are engaged to be married this June.  I was recently offered and accepted a position as a professor in a rural location.  The job will start in August, and we've started looking at houses in the new location.  

In my current job, I make decent money and I will be making substantially more as a professor.  I'm also lucky to have saved a decent amount of money  for a down payment, with no debt.  Meanwhile, my fiancee is in grad school to become a public school teacher.  She  works full time, has a small amount of savings, and about $60k in student loan debt.  She's in the process of applying for jobs in the rural location where we'll be moving in August.

I spoke to a mortgage lender, who told me that it was up to us whether to include my fiancee on the loan application.  The lender didn't give me a ton of information about the pluses or minuses of that choice, saying it was a personal decision.  

**Questions**

The disadvantages of including my fiancee seem clear: she doesn't have a lot of income and doesn't yet have a job lined up in the new location, but does have $60k debt, which can only hurt our application.  But what are the advantages?    I understand that I'll be solely on the hook for the loan if she's not included, but does that change once we get married?   I know we'll have to pay her student loans in addition to the mortgage, but what else should we be considering when we decide whether to include her on the application?

I have similar questions about the deed.  Obviously, listing her on the deed would make her a co-owner.  But if we don't list her before we get married, will she automatically get a property right once we tie the knot?

ekflwq|2020-01-05 17:00:53|Hello! I am looking for a bit of financial advice. I am not struggling, and have a current plan that is working well. I just want to consolidate a bit, and reduce the cards that I have. I'm not sure if I have the right idea, or if my thinking is wrong.|"I am 25, I have good credit, with good diverse history, that has dropped to decent lately. Talking from 700's to 650's, due to a couple things but primarily regarding a streamlined refinance that I was offered on my mortgage that is currently in the works. 


 * I just bought my first house this year
 
 * I do not currently have insurance, as my previous insurance was through my previous employer

 * I graduated with my Bachelor's around the same month I purchased the house

 * I have a few credit cards, with a grand or two on each. They are all still around a third of their total limits.

    • Discover: $3,426.93 (first time over $2,000)

    • Capital One: $1,876.86 (honestly, I'm fine with this one)

    • Amazon: $2,134.98 (first time over $1,500)

    • BofA: $1,364.61 (first time over $800)

    • Auto Loan: $5,730.35 (I just want this gone)

 * I have a little bit of student loans, but those aren't really a part of the issue here at all. Although I wouldn't mind lumping them into consolidation if it's possible and advantageous, but I don't see that happening.  

Basically the situation is when I was about 20 I was travelling and opened a few credit cards to build credit but ended up needing to use them. I have dropped the balances down into hundreds in the past, but due to my inconsistent seasonal work at the time they had a tendency to inflate back up a bit. That's pretty much where they sit now, a little more inflated than normal due to some turbulence in my life. The problem isn't paying them back, it's the cards themselves. Or even just the amount of cards. Four cards and a car payment, with everything a house brings along is a lot of bills to keep track of. I just want to consolidate the debt, so I can close a few of the cards and rid myself of the auto loan. With that, I have had a good habit of paying off what I spend on my card immediately, it's just past stuff that hasn't completely gone away that's allowed some compounding. 

In the past, with situations like this, I had a lucrative job at a restaurant serving tables. Where in a summer I could be taking in anywhere from $2,000 to $3,000 a week for the whole summer. I would work 5 to 7 days a week, usually about 10 to 18 hours a day. I don't have that exact job anymore as of this past September, but I am not adverse to working a lot and have a lot of offers in front of me. For both degree centered and restaurant employment. I was already planning on doubling, or tripling, down on jobs and just powering it out for a few months. This debt consolidation would be even more of an incentive. I just haven't decided yet. 

I want to close the cards I have, work a ton for the next few months, then open cards that are actually helpful for me way down the road. For example, like a Home Depot card instead of a useless Bank of America or Wells Fargo card that don't help me at all. Then I can just set it to full payments automatically and it won't build up, but it will have perks pertinent to what I am doing. This is just an example, I haven't really even looked into other cards because that's a step I won't allow myself to do until I can close cards first and I wont allow myself to spend more until I pay a good sum off.

I was thinking of taking out a personal loan for about $15,000 (that doesn't include the student loans), maybe more, and just paying everything off and immediately closing the cards. I have an employment transition coming up where I will have much more consistent income, and more than likely more than what I have been making previously. This will allow me to continue paying the same amount I have been, but to one source. I do live rather frugally so I would probably putting forth even bigger payments.

 * Should I just take the loan out for the credit cards (~$10,000)?

 * Should I take it out for the cards and auto loan? (~$15,000)?

 * Should I not do any of it at all, and just work away like I had planned?

ekak7l|2020-01-05 08:49:04|Living in a run-down, but free house - renovate or buy another?|"I'm in my early 30s, recently separated the military, am unemployed, and will be starting school via the GI bill this month. I have no debt, own my truck, have very good savings, and am single with no kids (I have a pug). In a year or two, I'll have the option to purchase the farmhouse that I grew up in for a significant discount off market value. I'm currently living in a house provided for free by a relative for virtually as long as I want, however it is in pretty rough shape.

I have a lease agreement with my relative ($0/mo, but mostly for legal protection between us), and I'm allowed to renovate as I see fit or not at all. Potentially could buy it later, but that seems unlikely due to zoning issues. Anyway, at approximately 850sqft, it needs roughly $40,000 in renovations to be in ""normal"" condition - foundation repairs, electrical work, insulating/finishing a couple rooms, HVAC system installation, and a new roof. It has a leaky tin roof, window A/C units, two unfinished rooms, a sag in the long support beam, a settled/shifted corner of the foundation, and a rigged up furnace-to-heat-pump sort of heating system that is....effective, yet - well, it gets the job done. It is livable as-is for a bachelor (it's an old 1930 farmhouse type), but at minimum I think to stay here I'd need to spend $3,000-6,000 to make it adequate for my needs - patch the roof, update electrical & finish the two rooms for the space.

I'm thinking that based on local rent costs being approximately $600/mo or $7200/year, then it's still worth it to fix it up as long as I stay under that amount. If I were to spend $7k, then live in it comfortably for 2 years; that would be very cheap ""rent"". However, due to certain family matters, I may not be interested in buying the old family farmhouse in a year or two, therefore am also considering buying a small house in the area for $75-120,000. The difficulty with that being that despite savings, I'm unemployed which makes acquiring a home loan difficult because most lenders don't consider the GI Bill living stipend (roughly $1500/mo tax-free during classes) a source of income. I could work part-time probably to secure a loan, but I have zero desire or real need to work while going to school using the GI bill benefits - a small home loan monthly payment would be perfectly feasible though.

I trust my relative regarding this living arrangement, but still do not like being under someone's thumb so to speak. The opportunity to purchase the old family farmhouse is good, but there are variables at play that may delay it becoming available to me. I don't necessarily have to remain in this area either. These are weighted issues that I'll have to ponder, but at least for the strictly financial aspects I suppose I'm looking for second opinions. Sorry if this was long-winded, but getting out of the service, going ""home"", and all this is quite a lot to process."|TheDecafDude|False|https://redd.it/ekak7l|8|0.82|0|11|1|personalfinance

A two story version I'm looking at would be 273k no upgrades with an 8k bonus for whatever (the house, upgrades, PMI)

The three story version would be 305k or so (also no upgrades) and would allow for 10k for whatever. My thoughts are thinking resale value (potential third bedroom) and general more space for growing into.

Many basics are already included in the base value of the house (gas furnace, gas water heater, water softener)

Theoretically, I could rent out part of the house or the whole house if needed. Also, while the house would be being built I'd essentially be saving the money I make at whatever job I land towards the home, which could be 27k (gross).

So my New Years Resolution this year is to really focus on building my savings account and starting a retirement account. My plan is to try and split $500 per month between my savings account and a retirement account. As my savings account grows, I plan on putting more money into the retirement account. 

But I literally have no clue how to start a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. Here are some of my main questions and concerns: 

* As a beginner, should I just focus on an account with a robo-advisor? I have no clue what index funds are, ETFs are, etc. I want to learn and educate myself, but I feel having a robo-advisor would be a good place to start? 
* Can I eventually roll over the account to one where I am more hands-on with the investments after I get the hang of things? 
* What are some places you recommend for an absolute newbie?

I still need to calculate my MAGI but I think I may have over-funded my account considering my gross income ended up being 50% more than last year. By September I knew that my income would increase but Roth contribution limits totally slipped my mind. I understand that I need to move those net contributions and earnings to a traditional IRA account but I'm not sure at this point what dollar amount that is.

Moving forward I will be doing a backdoor Roth and likely each year I will contribute to a traditional IRA and then roll-over in order to avoid over-funding my Roth account during the year.

How do I determine how much I need to move from Roth to Traditional this year? Is this MAGI and IRS partial contribution requirement dependent?

ekia5r|2020-01-05 20:08:19|I (25) am realizing that I have not been smart with my money. I have a Savings Account, Roth IRA and 401(k) that I would like some help optimizing so I can grow my wealth.|"Thank you to all of you who are taking the time to read this and help me out a bit.

**Preface:** 

I (25) am currently going through all my finances and doing my best to be really proactive since I feel like I've been a bit too lenient in recent times and really want to straighten up. After bonuses etc I am grossing right around the $70k mark annually, and should see about a 5% increase on my income and bonuses annually. I am also currently looking at some ""side hustles"" to earn extra for savings and investments etc. My long term goal is to optimize how I am putting my money away since I want to invest and save more. When I was young I was in the military and saw most of my income as ""play money"" and never quite got out of that attitude even as a civilian with bills piling up. I have not been very good at saving money in the past and want to actively be better at it since I am now seeing that the way money generally works is not how I thought it did. 

**Expenses:**

I have no student loans etc and no major debt except my truck payment which is right side up. I use my credit card for everything but pay it off entirely every month, I do not carry over debt, nor do I have any other debts. My other expenses besides rent and taxes are pretty minimal over all, I have been trying to spreadsheet and track spending to figure out what I am retaining every month and honestly I can't quite figure it out. I am going to try to 1. decrease spending on stuff like ""toys"" and eating out and 2. better track my spending so I can obtain an accurate figure. It seems I should be keeping around $800-1200 a month that I am not spending. 

**Situation:** 

ROTH IRA:

I currently have a Roth IRA with USAA that I opened in 2013 at 18, Target Date is 2060. Since inception it has yielded 6.84% which seems around average based on my understanding, though I feel like I could possibly transfer it to someone like Fidelity or Vanguard and yield even better. I put about 50% of the annual max into this IRA since I originally did not have the means to max it out and now am putting more into my 401(k) since I feel like it is netting me better results long term. 

401(k):

I also have a 401(k) that I've had a little over a year now (Summer 2018) with Fidelity, which my employer adds a 6% match on. I contribute 6.5% currently. Because of the match and my own 6.5% contribution the 401(k) is rapidly outgrowing the Roth IRA. 

Savings:

I have run some budget analyses on my current income/expenses and am working on reducing my monthly expenses as best I can in order to free up money for savings and investments. I put a minimum of $100/mth into my savings account as of recent along with all other contributions. A few years ago I lost a good bit of my savings due to some health factors so I am trying to recover from that. I want to increase my savings in order to have a ""rainy day fund"" and eventually money to downpay on a house. 

**Goals:**

My key goals here are to figure out whether I should spend out more on my 401(k) or Roth IRA, and whether I should consider optimizing my target dates or possibly move my Roth to a better provider. Any tips on how to better budget or grow my savings would also be much appreciated. If any other info is needed please let me know and I will provide it. I really appreciate the help!

ekcfy6|2020-01-05 12:30:47|USA: Do you have to pay short term capital gains on municipal ETFs?|"Not sure of a better subreddit for this..

A bit of background:

Usually if you hold onto a stock or etf for less than 1 year, any gains you get will be taxed like personal income at around 25%-30% per year.

But if you hold onto it for longer than a year, than you pay long term capital gains at just around 10%-15% per year.

However, certain types of munipal bonds are special: if you buy these bonds, you are helping the government pay for roads and stuff, so they make the capital gains on these bonds tax exempt.

ETFs are huge collections of funds. You can buy an etf with a bunch of tax free bonds.

Currently, I have 26k saved up and have paid for all of my college up to this point. I am making $18 an hour working 35 hours a week, but want to quit job and go full time school. I also want to get a big 4 internship. If i continue with current job, I can only manage 3 classes per semester. I would not graduate until late 2022.

Should I quit and get loans? I have 770 for rent every month.I would graduate May 2021, or if get spring internship next year, fall 2021.

Also, will my past work experience help me in getting big 4? Will my past 2 jobs hurt me since they were so short?"|lakers24dog|False|https://redd.it/ekeqil|2|1.0|0|9|1|personalfinance

I went into the branch, they wrote me a check for how much was in the account, and I took it home and deposited mobily in my new (6 year old) account. I then threw away the check.

When I did my month end expense and income tracking this weekend, I saw that the amount I deposited had been immediately withdrawn from the new account. As far as I can see, there is no note about why this occurred. since these are both local regional credit Unions, they have been closed all weekend so I can't contact anyone until 8 a.m. tomorrow. 

Did I really just throw this money away?

ekhek5|2020-01-05 19:07:08|Please help me I really have no idea where to go from here.|"It’s the sad familiar story of girl falls in love and trusts the person 100% only to get totally screwed over in the end. 

In 2018 I (29 female) bought (against my better judgement and persuasion by my then fiancé) a condo in Connecticut. I bought the place for $99,000 with little money down. The mortgage payment each month is $788.91 and to make matters worse that includes a HOA of $280.41 a month, I believe at the moment my loan is about $96,000

And here’s my big problem. I had to move back home (in New York) after a mental health emergency where I was in treatment for a good few months. My ex was nice enough to rent the condo from me this year but has since decided to hate me and tell me I’m “on my own”. Unfortunately we broke up due to him being controlling, and unfaithful but that means nothing when it comes to finances and what is legal. That condo is mine and I am stuck having no idea what to do. 

I now live in New York because going back to that state would most likely kill me. I’ve taken moves to try to get it sold. It’s currently on the market and I’m working with a realtor. And unfortunately it only has been for about three weeks because previously my ex told me he would rent another year and then changed his mind just last month. I have a few showings a week but hope it will pick up now that the holidays are over. My biggest problem is I have no way to pay once February 1st comes along. I live in another state, I pay rent for an apartment here, and have picked up my life and started over with a great job and supportive family and friends. I can’t go back to CT. 

If I can’t sell this house by the end of the month I’m not sure what my options are and this is where I’m looking for advice. I know the possibility of foreclosure and filing for bankruptcy are very high. I want to know just how bad that will effect my life. Are there any other options? (aside from moving back to CT which isn’t possible) People have told me to rent it out but being a landlord from another state is almost impossible as well. It was different when I knew my ex and knew he wouldn’t destroy the place. Can I even rent while it’s on the market? 

I’m afraid, terrified actually. A lot of days I feel like there is no other way out then just ending it all. My mental health has suffered drastically and I feel like I’m right back to where I was this time last year. Its Sunday and I’m still in bed and I have no plans of getting up because I can’t even will myself to do it. I feel entirely lost and don’t know how to deal with any of this

I’m sorry if this was a lot but I wanted to provide background. I really hope someone can shed some light or give me some much needed advice

Would a dealer be likely to buy the old car from us at a later date, and would the terms be comparable to trading it in? I know I could just ask some dealers, but I'm not sure how much I could trust their answers.

I honestly could have done way better but I had a mid life crisis from August to November. I resell and fix smartphones

The issue is that, I currently only have $200 to my name. Can anyone help me figure out what’s wrong? Here are my monthly expenses
Monthly:

Phone bill ($90 ish I have to have Verizon since I’m always on my phone for business. I pay my mom this money)

Clothing: $50-150(most around $100, ok this is bad but i am trying to stop spending as much

Lunch: $100 my parents give me food, it’s just that sometimes I eat out when I’m at my internship and I’m tired

Rent: $50 READ: This sounds illegal but it’s not. I pay my parents, voluntarily, rent, they will triple it and give it back in the future when I’m buying a house for myself. I know my parents they aren’t going to cheat me.

Here are my one time big expenses:
Bitcoin investments $1500 Ok so I kind of got into a bitcoin gambling habit, it’s just cause I saw a YouTuber say there’s a way to triple your money. Well I tried and I turned this $1500 into $2500 until my dumbass decided to push his luck. I stopped this around 4 months ago and will not be doing it again. Ever. 
Gifts for parents $1000 I got my mom a MacBook and my dad this saw from the Home Depot, my mom is a real estate investor and was using her iPad so I found a deal on a MacBook and got it for her birthday. 0 regrets and my dad uses the saw a lot for his projects. It did dent my wallet a lot. 
Rare usernames/accounts $500 thus was a complete loss. I invested in rare username accounts and Instagram accounts with a lot of followers, I made probably $500 and lost $1000
And my phone collection $800. These were all purchased for way below market value and consist of some prototype and rare phones, some never heard of before. If I sold I would get 3-4k

Gross yearly income - 135k

Current rent - $1000 

Currently monthly bills/expenses - about $1250 ($250 car payment, $200 student loans, $800 for  the rest - phone, internet, gym, renters insurance, car insurance, gas, utilities) We will need a second car at some point.

Other expenses - still trying to figure out how much to spend on groceries, household supplies, and personal spending.

No credit card debt

Our credit scores range from 799-823. It's different depending on whether we use the Amex or Citi or BoA app. I understand that mortgage credit scores are different and we haven't gone to a lender for pre-approval yet.  

Other things - car loan started in July and we opened 2 credit cards in July for rewards benefits. 

Savings - $25k

Retirement - We have a pension through work, and don't contribute beyond that even though we should.

ekguww|2020-01-05 18:28:57|Help understanding student loan interest|"My fiancé wants to take out a government loan for grad school and the interest rate is 6% fixed interest rate. The website says something about interest amount is outstanding balance multiplied by interest factor multiplied by number of days between loan payments.

She wants to take out a loan for $8900 which on the surface would be $537 in interest but depending on how that is calculated I could see it being a bit higher.  

We aren’t going to get married until 2021 and I think she can deduct the interest rate from her taxes.  I have plenty of money to just give her the loan but any money I pay her will also lose the ability to potentially make money in the stock market (I’ve done a few percentage points better than the S&P500 the last 5 years).  I have been completely out of debt for about 3 years now and have watched my net worth grow pretty quickly so I’m wondering if a Loan even makes since at all.  

Can anyone help me understand if 1) my math is correct and the interest if paid instantly will be $0 or $537 (or more) and 2) if there are any reasons she should take the loan because it could be free leverage with also a potential write off (she’s going to be making very little money in 2020).

ekgiyk|2020-01-05 18:04:56|Noob here, what should I do with my money in savings account?|"32m. Right now I have ~120k sitting in my savings account earning no money and that’s pretty much all I have! I would like to retire (become financially independent, not necessarily stop working altogether) early - as early as possible. How do I maximize that money? Also, how do I maximize income going forward? Is there any book or blog recommended specifically to begin with? Appreciate your help.

**Background**

Due to poor life choices, I let myself go into debts (foreign student with loan abroad for studies and ~18k cc debts in US with no job) and then had a below minimum wage paying job till the end of 2016. During formative years I didn’t learn any investment lessons, rather I was more focused on addressing worst debts one by one.

Starting from 2017, I have had good paying jobs, paid off all debts, and have saved up a bit of money till date. FYI, I front load and max out my 401k, and I talked to my company provided financial advisor, he said that I don’t have options for roth and all because of my salary. When it comes to financial matters I am the epitome of deer in front of headlights.

My take home is about 9.5k a month ( without year end bonuses), rent and utilities- 2.6k, food another 500-750 (I love to cook at home and sometimes eat out). ~1000 on some weird purchases every month (trying to cut this out, but I seem to find something or other somewhat unnecessary stuff to waste my money on). Commute etc - reimbursed by work. ~1000 - I send to my parents outside US every other month. I don’t own a car now, but may get one sometimes this year (if I do, that will be a used one - CPO or 5-7 years old). Rest 4-4.5k goes to my savings. 

Credit score - I have hovered around 720 from 2011-2015, then it took a nosedive all the way down to 620 by 2017. Now it’s hovering around 800.

Family details - 32m, single, and strictly do not plan to have kid(s). I will support my parents though for the foreseeable future."|invictus08|False|https://redd.it/ekgiyk|1|0.67|0|5|1|personalfinance

Hi all, I have some basic questions on refinancing/consolidating student debt for my gf.

She has a few US student loans on nelnet with a rate of approximately 6% and around $40k in total. I think she is on 10 yr repayment. Her credit score is about 750 and mine is like 810. With her income being 70k and mine being 90k. She is paying 2-3x the monthly minimum to get rid of it.

So I guess my questions are

1. do we go to nelnet or shop around at places like SoFi to see about refinancing and consolidating? And do they just take over the loans or something?
2. does me cosigning it get her a smaller rate?
3. she plans on having a $10k medical procedure in the next 1-2 years that will be out of pocket, Can we get that lumped in somehow or do we just come back to the bank later for that amount?
4. Is there anything in specific to look for in a provider or can I just go to the first one google suggests?

ekgfbz|2020-01-05 17:58:23|Could this plan work to buy my first home?|"I'm 33 years old, living in northern New Jersey and attempting to buy my first home.  Last year I started a Marcus account to save money for a down payment, have been putting money into the account every paycheck, and have kept an eye on local listings for anything I think I can swing.  

I work full-time, volunteer with a local organization, and do a per-diem nighttime gig that is now about once a month.  Between all of these things (salary, volunteer stipend & incentives, and the per-diem money) I gross around $65,000 a year.  

Currently my only debt is my car loan ($325 per month, 0% interest) and a care credit account (Current balance of $7,200, 0% interest, will be paid off by June).  My credit score, which was in the low 800's before I opened the care credit line, is 764.

In my area, property taxes are between $9,000-$12,000 a year.  There are a few reasons I wish to stay in my current area.  Firstly, my boss has made it clear that he is retiring no later than four years from now.  I commute 3 hours a day for my job.  It's a great job, excellent vacation, I'm able to have a lot of autonomy, but I'm not likely to remain past his retirement.  So, there's little to no reason for me to move closer to there.  Secondly, my volunteer organization, because I put in so much time, gives me a stipend every year, along with a bonus, and monthly incentives for putting in extra time.  This accounts for roughly 6-12% of my income every year.  So even leaving the area for lower taxes, I would lose money unless I could find that much of a total reduction.  

I recently applied for a 30-year mortgage of $300,000 and was denied based on the fact that with my income level, it would be too much of a stretch for me to make payments.  

The other night, a friend of mine suggested that we should find a 4-bedroom and rent it along with two of our other unmarried friends.  These are people I go on vacation with every year, have known for at least twenty years, are long-term gainfully employed, and looking for a change.  This got the wheels in my head turning and I formulated an idea.  

If I were to purchase a 4-bedroom home, allow them to move in, and charge each of them $600 a month plus utilities, I would have an extra $1,800 a month to add to my buying power.  

Full-disclosure, I have never owned a home, I have never rented to anyone before, and I am very new at this.  Any advice would be appreciated.  If you see anything above that I could be doing differently to save or increase my buying power, please let me know.

ejz5t5|2020-01-04 17:04:44|Not doing great at work, just saw an ad for my job posted online. I’m stretched to the brink financially. Please help.|"I have been working in sales for 8 years now. I started my “dream job” 9 months ago. I love what I do, I love the industry—but I’ve constantly felt set up to fail. I’m supposed to be in a junior role, getting mentored, and I have been completely on my own. I have brought up the need for mentoring, as it’s a specialized industry, but it’s still not happening. 

It’s a field sales role. I’ve been told to stay out of the accounts that buy stuff, I’m relegated to accounts that just spent their budget or accounts with no budget. That’s the extent of my mentoring.

I have not met my quota yet. It’s frustrating because my role is base plus commission, and base alone is not enough to get by on. I kept telling myself to just work harder, put in more hours. I’ve asked for feedback to improve. I’ve asked for guidance and help. Every other person in my role, across the US, has worked with their “senior” salesperson until they were comfortable on their own. I have been left almost completely to figure everything out myself. I truly feel like I’m being pushed out. 

I was casually browsing LinkedIn for roles similar to mine and found a description for my role. It is very specialized, in a particular region and industry, and I am completely confident that was my job.

I’m struggling financially as it is. My mortgage is $1550 (high COL area, rents are just as much) and my daycare is about $2,000/month for two kids. I can not afford to take even a week unpaid at this point, I’m stretched so thin—those costs don’t even include water and utilities. I have quite a bit of credit card debt. My base salary is only $60k a year, and I only make a few hundred to a few thousand a quarter in commission. 

I don’t even know where to start. I’m mortified. I’ve worked so hard, and it took so much to get hired in this industry. My confidence is shot. I’m worried employers are going to see a 9 month stint on my resume and I’ll get blacklisted. 

What do I do now? I’m updating my resume right now, I plan on 10-30 applications a day, I’m planning on focusing 110% at my job, maybe work longer hours, I’m going to start listing anything of value to set up an emergency fund. What else can I do? I feel like my life is over."|Forgetm3|False|https://redd.it/ejz5t5|97|0.85|0|56|1|personalfinance
ekg9b1|2020-01-05 17:46:39|Credit card debt|28, make about 30,000 a year and I have roughly 9,000 in credit card debt. 5,700/6,500 on one card and 3,800/4,000 on another card. I recently paid off 1,000 on my bigger card to get under the maximums so I can start rebuilding my credit. Applied for a chase 0 interest 0 balance transfer fee card so I could move all my debt to one card so the monthly interest isnt killing me, but I was denied. Credit score around 600. I feel like I'm drowning and not making any moves on these cards, even though I pay off at least 400 a month, any ideas on how to help get this paid off?|smilinseth|False|https://redd.it/ekg9b1|0|0.5|0|7|1|personalfinance
ekg8os|2020-01-05 17:45:28|Refinancing large student loans, need some help.|"SOFI just rejected me because of a $20 dollar delinquency from 3 years ago (paid the card off, interest rolled over and I didn't know and it went delinquent). I also have a somewhat nonstandard history, I left college for almost 2 years via leave of absence and then coming back part-time and then full time. So my loans were deferred for 6 years they said a slight impacting factor was that the amount paid for time existing is too low which makes sense with that history.

I make 140k and I have 160k in loans, the interest is insane at an average 9%. I can manage the payments fine it just leaves much less room for savings / life goals.

SOFI doesn't have any in-person systems that you can speak with to discuss the situation but it sounds like I'm somewhat nonstandard. Do you guys have any advice or know of any companies I can talk to an underwriter to explain. I believe I'm a pretty safe bet, I've been making 100k+ for 5 years, started working when I left college and then finished college at night. My credit utilization is a little high at 50% but not horrible and I'm still saving 15% (was 30% before they kicked in) even with the crazy loan payments."|itb206|False|https://redd.it/ekg8os|1|0.67|0|8|1|personalfinance
ekj7jv|2020-01-05 21:16:13|Hired to answer emails, now doing creative direction and getting paid the same rate|"I was initially hired at $15/hr as a personal assistant for a small business owner, and was basically tasked with some simple email and social media-related tasks. I've been working with the owner for less than half a year, but have been continually finding ways to grow the business and develop skills to support it. 

Since starting this job I've expanded the business's social media reach, implemented solutions that optimize customers' shopping experience, and have done some serious reorganizing of how it operates. I'm also now handling all the graphic design, doing all the content writing, managing our website, dealing with customer questions/complaints, juggling all our social media accounts AND doing creative direction. 

The owner is responsible for sourcing inventory, but has always done this in a haphazard manner - our products are ordered and sold very randomly. What I've been doing is noticing patterns in what's available and developing strategies to market them more effectively to customers, and it's been working out really well for the business. We actually doubled revenue in December, which means the owner made around $50k gross profit. I got a small raise a couple months ago (which I negotiated for), but am still making $20/hr. 

I'm not sure how to gauge my worth, but it's clear (to me and the owner) that I'm very good at what I do. Nevertheless, the owner seems to think that my contributions are either ""part of the job"" or just due to my enthusiasm for my work. I get a lot of ""that's such a great idea!"" but they seem to place more trust in outside consultants with better technical credentials but no good practical ideas. These people are freelancers who charge up to $70/hr, but offer bland, dated and generic suggestions that aren't tailored to this particular business. Everything I've come up with has been very specific to the brand and brand identity, and we've been able to liquidate a lot of old merchandise using my ideas. 

Despite the dismal pay, I love my job and I particularly love the brand, and the owner's very easy to work with - I get to set my own schedule, get a lot of creative freedom, and don't have to deal with office politics (which I loathe). They seem to think that my ideas are free though (in part my fault, I contribute them freely), and focus more on deliverables and concrete work. So to them, it's pretty fair to pay me $20/hr because my daily tasks are relatively simple (though varied) - I do some graphic design and photo editing, some content writing, some web design, some customer service. Much of the conceptualizing I do is done randomly and on off-hours (I think about work all the time because I do genuinely love it), so I have no idea how to charge for it. Actually I have no idea I was even doing creative direction until somebody pointed it out to me, since I've mainly worked as a writer in the past. 

I'd like to be getting paid what I'm worth to the business, but I'm not sure how I should be charging or how I should be negotiating. I already know the owner's not willing to make me a partner (they're very protective of their business), but at this point I feel I'm a necessary part of it. The business would certainly survive without me, but I don't see the owner being able to scale without my help. I've already drafted a sales plan for this year (normally the owner doesn't plan anything, just uploads products to their site randomly) that they'll be unable to implement without my support. 

To get to the point - what kind of payment should I ask for and how should I negotiate? Tbh I think I don't even want to be charged hourly anymore, since I'm willing to take on projects on my own time to support the business. I'm leaning toward asking for a cut of profits (10% minimum, which is still modest for how much the business makes) to incentivize performance, since I'm getting to a point where I'm hesitant to keep working on my own time since my efforts aren't really recognized. I'm confident I can boost profits by at least 25% this year but I'm not sure if I want to at $20 an hour. If I were getting a share of profits though, the owner would be entitled to all of my time (which would include me taking classes relevant to growing their business). Is this a decent solution or is there a better one I could propose?"|drunk3nangel|False|https://redd.it/ekj7jv|0|0.25|0|6|1|personalfinance

ejvzok|2020-01-04 12:16:42|Citibank ATM swallowed my cash deposit!|"I did a cash deposit on one of the Citibanks ATMs. I have done it many times in the past and there was never a problem. However, my most recent deposit didn't go well. The machine took the money and gave me a receipt saying there was a technical problem and they can't give me my cash. So I called the number on the receipt and the customer rep filed a claim and issued me the credit. I went on the app on my phone to check and found out he gave me $30 short. Then I made another call, spoke with another rep and that lady issued me the $30 on my account. That transaction was $580 in total.

&#x200B;

A few days later I received a letter saying they issued me the $30 credit to me permanently. I thought everything was good until last night I saw they took away the $550 credit. They send me a letter to my account saying after their investigation they didn't see any cash deposit. What do I do? How come they are able to verify the $30 but they don't see the other $550? I did everything in one transaction. They don't see the extra amount of money in the ATM at the end of the day? I think who ever was doing the investigation is just lazy, not doing his/her job but me as a customer have to take the hit!

ekfyng|2020-01-05 17:25:54|When to apply for mortgage and what things to look for?|"So we will be buying the condo that we are renting from my in-laws in March of this year. I checked the nearby condos in the same area and they are going in the range of $520-560k. We have been renting this condo for last two and a half year from in-laws and really like the location. We have the down payment saved in HYSA account, right now its 105k but should be able to save a bit more by March.  

My first question is how do I go about this buying process since I will be buying from in-laws. When do I apply for Mortgage and what fees to look for. 

For Sanity check, do you think we can afford this condo? Before taxes we make $171k in so cal area and dont have any debt currently. But we just had a baby in September so I am expecting our expenses to increase a bit. Also, my 2009 corolla might also be on last legs and would need a new car in near future.  

One thing I concerned about is the HOA of this property is high ($440). It pays for the trash and water. But the majority of the expenses are landscapes as I went through their financial statement. But on the other side my FIL mentioned he can transfer the property tax rate to us which could be a significant savings. He's going to be talking to someone this month but I have no idea how this works or if we qualify for the tax transfer.

ekfyky|2020-01-05 17:25:45|Vanguard: VTSAX vs. the field|"Hi. 

I'm 37 and have been maxing out my 401(k) in recent years, with all of it going into Fidelity's 2045 target fund. I've also been maxing out a Roth IRA every year (UBS-managed mutual funds; happy with performance, but thinking about moving to a lower fee option). Emergency fund of 6 months in HYSA. Single, no kids, no mortgage. Rent in HCOL area where I don't plan to buy, although maybe I'd want a down payment in a less expensive place within the next five years.

For the first time, I'm opening the year with about $10,000 in extra cash I'd like to invest beyond those fully-funded retirement accounts. 

I've seen everyone sing Vanguard's praises, and it seems like VTSAX might be a good option for someone with a fairly long horizon. For what it's worth, I'm planning to leave my job in the next 6 months and imagine I'll probably try to roll over the 401(k) money too.

Any obvious downsides to VTSAX I'm missing—or are there similar options people like more?"|NateNYC82|False|https://redd.it/ekfyky|1|0.67|0|11|1|personalfinance

Here's the thing - I can afford to pay it in my payment schedule and I'm even due to get a raise at my job (which I purposely didn't factor in). But the idea of having such a large debt just puts me at so much unease, especially for a depreciating asset. But it's something I've always wanted to do since I graduated college 5 years ago.
