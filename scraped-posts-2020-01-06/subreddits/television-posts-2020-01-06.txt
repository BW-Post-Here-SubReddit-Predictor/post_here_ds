ekfvtu|2020-01-05 17:20:17|A guide to Season 1 of The Witcher|"This is not a show that holds hands, and I’ve realized a lot of people not previously familiar with the books or the games are struggling to connect all the dots. Let me be your humble guide.

**What the hell is a witcher?**

The world of *The Witcher* is the result of an event that took place a thousand years ago called the Conjunction of the Spheres, which deposited a bunch of different species from other dimensions into that world, including humans. Before, it was just the elves and the dwarves, who have now been pushed to the margins of their own world by the resourceful, faster-breeding human race.

In order to survive in this new and really fucked up world full of monsters from several dozen other places, the humans figured out how to use certain herbs to mutate children into, for lack of a better word, super-soldiers: witchers. The process, known as the trial of the grasses, kills 70% of the children and leaves the remainder sterile. Geralt received such a heavy dose that it turned his hair white. As you can imagine, handing over a child to the witchers, often due to poverty (this is not a society with orphanages) or as payment for a service a witcher has done a village, is deemed a fairly horrible thing to have to do, and the big-picture necessity of it doesn't help much with community relations.

The survivors develop superhuman vision (the yellow eyes) and reflexes, and a limited ability to do magic, super basic stuff like a force push, a momentary shield, a fire burst, or befuddling the mind of a target - not remotely on the same scale as sorcerers. Above all, witchers develop the ability to survive the ingestion of certain powerful potions that temporarily assist in the hunting and killing of monsters (for example, one potion used when hunting vampires turns the witcher’s blood into a toxin that will harm the vampire if the witcher is bitten).

The children are trained by senior witchers: Geralt is part of the School of the Wolf, for example, based out of the far northern fortress of Kaer Morhen. Then they're sent out into the world to wander the land as professional monster exterminators. They’re very long-lived, but the dangerous nature of their careers means they rarely die in bed.

Witchering is ultimately a trade like any other (they’re not heroes - they demand payment), but it's one that sets them apart. They're needed, but also feared and hated. In part it's because their trade forces them to travel in an era of xenophobia, in part their fucked up appearance, and finally because monster problems usually develop due to some sort of moral rot within the community that no one wants to admit to - murdered lovers returning as wraiths, that sort of thing. In some cases, witchers have done their part to contribute to the problem by breaking bad, once very memorably en masse - the School of the Cat began hiring out as assassins and was ultimately destroyed.

As human society evolves out of the dark ages, witchers are also becoming less common: monsters are rarer than they used to be, and growing populations make “brute force” options like sending a couple hundred soldiers to do the job of slaying a monster more feasible - if usually far more messy, like resolving a hostage crisis with a cruise missile. As witchers become less necessary, they also become more hated.

**What’s all this political stuff?**

Edit: here's a map: [https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/aa4wj8/map\_of\_the\_witcher\_world/](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/aa4wj8/map_of_the_witcher_world/)

The Witcher is set in a vague analogue to eastern Europe in the middle ages. The “northern kingdoms” are a bunch of squabbling, backwards, superstitious fiefdoms and petty warlords. To their south lies the Empire of Nilfgaard, which is (ironically) a model of technological and social progress by that world's standards, except for their unfortunate desire to forcibly absorb all the northern kingdoms, which they’ve been accomplishing piecemeal for decades.

In the north, an Illuminati-style Brotherhood of Sorcerers influences everything by providing advisers to all of the rulers. In Nilfgaard, sorcerers are treated as tools and kept on a short leash by the state. In the north, elves and dwarves are hated, feared, and marginalized, very analogous to Jews or Native Americans. In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens. In the north, if you have a monster problem you hire a witcher. In Nilfgaard, you call in the national guard. You get the idea. It’s like Napoleonic France coexisting just next door to twelve flavours of Transylvania. There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn’t be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don’t see it that way.

**Great, fine. What’s the chronological plot?**

The story begins with Yennefer, a hunchbacked peasant girl with a gift for magic sold to the northern academy of wizardry, which trains her to become an advisor to kings. The use of magic turns her beautiful and extremely long-lived, but sterile - a tradeoff she happily accepts at the time, but eventually comes to resent. As a result of internal politics, Yen is ultimately sent to advise the northern kingdom of Aedirn, and a sorceress with much less backbone (Fringilla) is sent to Nilfgaard, which over the years becomes a key factor in cementing the subordinate status of wizarding types in the southern empire. Yen spends decades as the power behind the throne in Aedirn, but when the Aedirnian king assassinates his wife and nearly turns Yen into collateral damage in the process, she loses her taste for the game of thrones and decides to live life for herself.

Meanwhile (give or take) Geralt, a witcher of the School of the Wolf, rolls into some town in the north named Blaviken to solve whatever local monster problems it’s got. Turns out there are no actual monsters that need defeating. There is, however, a princess named Renfri who was literally born under a bad sign. It’s unclear whether it caused her to become evil or whether everyone treating her as evil caused her to become cruel, but by the time she hits adulthood she’s vicious, vengeful, leading a band of cutthroats and hunting/being hunted by a sorcerer. Geralt is forced to kill her and her gang to prevent further carnage, but not before she prophecies that “the girl in the woods would be with him always” (being born under that sign had *some* magical effect). The resulting bloodbath, the need for which is poorly understood by the locals, earns him the moniker “the Butcher of Blaviken”, which the gruff but ultimately kindhearted Geralt hates.

At the same time, somewhere in the northern kingdom of Cintra, a teenaged Queen Calanthe has just won her first battle. It’s the start of an Elizabethan reign.

Geralt carries on his life as an itinerant exterminator, stopping along the way to rid the northern kingdom of Temeria from a cursed monster caused by royal incest between King Foltest and his sister, and eventually connects with Jaskier, a travelling bard. They take a shine to each other and begin travelling together. In addition to their friendship, there’s a practical aspect to their partnership: Geralt provides an endless source of material for Jaskier’s songs, and Jaskier acts as a one-man PR department for Geralt, giving him the moniker “the White Wolf” to compete with “the Butcher of Blaviken” and generally making it easier for Geralt to find work, demand higher rates and get paid without incident.

Meanwhile in Cintra, Queen Calanthe has grown from teenage military prodigy into dominant warrior queen. After her first husband Roegner died in a plague and despite having feelings for Eist, a prince of Skellige (an island chain of Celtic/Norse reavers off the coast), she remains unmarried so that she can remain squarely in charge.

Geralt and Jaskier attend a feast to determine a husband for Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta. It comes out that Duny, a knight cursed to look like a hedgehog, had once saved Roegner’s life and invoked the Law of Surprise as a reward (to give Duny that which Roegner had but did not know). Since Calanthe was pregnant, the reward was Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta, and now Duny is at the wedding feast to claim Pavetta’s hand in marriage. After several attempted stabbings, Pavetta happily accepts, and Calanthe also decides to marry Eist. Duny (no longer a hedgehog) tries to reward Geralt, who invokes the Law of Surprise himself, and surprise…Pavetta’s already pregnant with Ciri, giving Geralt a claim to the child to raise as his own. This is a political disaster and nobody is less pleased than Geralt, who tries to solve the problem by laying no claim to the child and immediately leaving Cintra. Calanthe attempts to make doubly sure of the issue by sending men to kill him, but they fail.

Despite his attempt to nip the problem in the bud, Geralt remains troubled. He doesn’t want to admit it, but the Law of Surprise has some magic to it, and by leaving Ciri in someone else’s hands he’s fighting against the current of fate. He does the healthy thing and attempts to resolve his unease by fishing a djinni in a bottle out of a lake to wish for a good night’s sleep. Shenanigans ensue, and Geralt and Jaskier travel to the nearest town to seek assistance saving Jaskier’s life. This is where they first meet Yen, who runs the place and is evidently happier ruling in hell than serving in heaven, so to speak. Yen tries to take advantage of the situation by capturing the djinn to become all-powerful, but the djinn nearly kills her. Geralt saves Yen by using his last wish to ask for their fates to be bound together (and since the djinn can't hurt its master, saving Yen's life).

It’s such a powerful wish that it’s not clear whether the djinn was in fact capable of granting it, but if it did, it explains why over the ensuing years, Geralt and Yen keep running into each other, which next occurs on a dragon hunt that Yen is undertaking in an attempt to regain her lost fertility. During that hunt, Yen needles Geralt about his hypocrisy for lecturing her about accepting what can’t be changed while all this time neglecting the child that fate had bestowed on him. It’s the last straw, and Geralt nuts up and returns to Cintra to check in on Ciri and ensure her well-being.

In the intervening years, Ciri’s parents (Duny and Pavetta) have died in a shipwreck and Calanthe and Eist are raising Ciri, who is now heir to the Cintran throne. Geralt gets an extremely frosty reception. Rumours of war with Nilfgaard (now ruled by an exceptionally capable, ambitious emperor) are circulating in Cintra, but they don’t make sense to Calanthe, who doesn’t think taking Cintra is a wise decision for Nilfgaard from a strategic perspective (Nilfgaard's apparently irrational desire to conquer Cintra is a plot point that won’t pay off until Season 2). Geralt offers to take Ciri away for a time to protect her from the prospect of impending war, but Calanthe rejects the idea, and Geralt is tossed in prison when he refuses to disown Ciri.

At this juncture, Nilfgaard launches a snap invasion, shocking Calanthe, successfully defeating the Cintran army, killing Eist, and sacking Cintra. Calanthe urges Ciri to seek out Geralt’s protection, and then commits suicide to avoid the indignity of capture. This is the point in the story when the chronology starts to unite and events begin to move quickly.

Ciri escapes the capital with Nilfgaardian hunters hot on her heels, first taking refuge with the dryads in the forest of Brokilon before eventually trying to make her way to her step-grandfather Eist’s family in Skellige. Along the way, a farmer’s wife takes her home to keep her safe, and tries to convince her to stay.

As the Nilfgaardian army marches north from Cintra toward the rest of the northern kingdoms, Yen and the other wizard Illuminati move to intercept them at Sodden Hill, a defensible chokepoint about a day away from the farmstead where Ciri is staying.

Geralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher’s keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn’t know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.

Ciri has a vision of Geralt at Sodden Hill calling out Yen's name, and leaves the farm, cutting through the woods toward Sodden Hill to do as Calanthe urged and connect with Geralt.

When Geralt reaches the farm, he realizes that by a cosmic stroke of fate, the wife of the farmer who saved him had found Ciri, who unknown to the farmer’s wife had left just before Geralt's arrival. Geralt recognizes the circumstance from the prophecy made to him by the dying Renfri decades earlier, and hares it into the woods to find the daughter destiny always meant for him to have. They finally meet, and Ciri asks him who the woman is that Geralt was calling out for in her vision (Yennefer), setting up the two of them to travel to the Sodden Hill battlefield in Season 2 to look for Yen, and possibly solve the mystery of why Nilfgaard was so hellbent on conquering Cintra."|grizwald87|False|https://redd.it/ekfvtu|20262|0.9|37|1447|1|television

ekkq8t|2020-01-05 23:12:18|Dracula went from truly top notch horror (episode 1) to a mixed bag but still pretty good (episode 2) to godawful unimaginably bad (episode 3). What a ride, it was like all of GoT in 1 afternoon.|"Loved episode 1 and the way it quickly but firmly stepped up showing us the evil of Dracula's character.

Episode two was a bit dumb at times, stretching the believability of characters but the character of Dracula was still so captivating. 

But then, the twist at the end of episode 2. It was such a downturn, the show instantly became 100% B-movie cringe. I couldn't believe they'd think completely changing the setting that much could work but I tried to keep an open mind. 

But episode 3 was even worse than I thought it could be. Just the 3 'lowlights' (out of many):

-The lawyer bailing Dracula out and everyone being mildly upset, and then going on with their business was so insanely not funny, believable or logical. It completely neutered the horror aspect of the show. It was a fundamentally bad idea. 

-The love story of the would-be female Freddy could've been compelling if it wasn't 10 minutes of a 5 hour show.

-But most of all, that ending. My god, that was some weak writing.

I did love Agatha though, and both main characters were phenomenally acted. 

What do you think? Can episode 3 legitimately be defended?"|hstheay|False|https://redd.it/ekkq8t|477|0.89|0|192|1|television

ekn2ro|2020-01-06 02:08:15|Succession is incredibly well written|"I just watched the first two seasons and it blew me away. It's one of the most well written shows I've ever seen. I think a testament to the excellence of the writing is that the dialogue is rarely surface level. 

A great example of this occurs in the episode, Tern Haven, when Marcia and Logan fight during the dinner with the Pierce family. At first, I thought it was another embarrassing moment that would ruin their chances for the acquisition. But it's actually the opposite. The fight is intentional and used to show that Marcia can stand up for herself, which they know Nan will enjoy, thus actually improving their chances at the acquisition. 

The dialogue is also incredibly fresh and original. Safe Room has one of the best comedic scenes to occur during a [funeral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGYjif4P16s). The show is full of these wonderfully bizarre lines. Connor's ""Hey, Dad. It's me, Connor Roy, your son."" Tabitha's ""I'm not uninterested in solving you."" Tom's ""I wonder if the sad I'd be without you would be less than the sad I get from being with you."" I'm always impressed when a show can find a new way to communicate something that feels like well explored territory. 

The tone of the show is also constantly changing in a way that feels satisfying and surprising. When Kendall and Shiv have a [moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__EQQPfo51A), it seems to build toward the two connecting and then having Kendall reveal to Shiv what's on his mind. However, their relationship prevents that because they're siblings but also competitors who are always looking for ammunition. The show is great at mixing comedy with drama, sometimes within the same scene. When [Gregory threatens Tom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozqc4otMen0), Tom feels a bit of anger but is mostly proud that he has helped Gregory become someone who can play the game. 
    
For a show that is full of easily detestable characters, I was surprised by how much my opinion of those characters changed over the course of two seasons. It's impressive when a show can make you root for someone who does horrible things. And I think the show is able to achieve this because the writing is so sharp and the performances are so well executed."|paull___|False|https://redd.it/ekn2ro|29|0.7|0|15|1|television
eky4g4|2020-01-06 18:34:02|Is Peaky Blinders more than cliche gangster period drama?|"Sorry for the inflammatory title but I wanted to be as direct as possible. So I watched the first episode of Peaky Blinders without knowing anything about the show besides it having a high IMDB score and a lot of people here praising it. The episode while amazingly crafted and acted just left me with no motivation to watch the show. I feel like I have seen this show/movie like 100 times already because I have seen these story beats in so many other things (similar to how you can guess plot of an action movie 5 minutes in). So here goes my predictions if I stuck through it and watched the rest of the show:

- The main protagonist slowly climbs the criminal organization ladder, becoming crime boss of his own few seasons in.

- He gets a girlfriend/wife who is smart and beautiful, who has nothing to do besides be there for him after he gets home from a tough day of crimin 
 - He cheats on her regularly but the show treats it as a no big deal since he does not ""love them"".
 - She cheats on him once after being sad and mistreated. Most likely with one of his friends. The show treats it as a tragedy of epic proportions. They still remain together tho.

- Cops are ultimately ineffectual because the witty protagonist outsmarts them and later on they are an afterthought

- Women are habitually unhappy (despite not have to slave 16 hours a day like 99% of other women in their world)  and want to be more than just a prop in ""mans world"" but the show never really lets them so they end up just that, a prop.

- Gang wars, random new villain popping up every season. Gangs which are just little bit more brutal than protagonists gang so you empathize with him winning at the end.

- The main protagonist has to some tough decisions, often killing people he cares about, because ""it has to be done"".

Is there anything more to the show than what I outlined? Is there a twist that would differentiate these show from the rest? Am I reading the show wrong? I am not saying the story beats are necessarily bad, but once you have seen as many as I have, it becomes a little boring and watching it purely because it's well crafted and acted does not interest me either. Maybe if it was a movie, but 40+ hours of television is a serious commitment. I could just instead watch Expanse which I have been putting off for years."|Jeffy29|False|https://redd.it/eky4g4|0|0.5|0|0|1|television

As arbitrary as that process was, there was something pretty special about having a couple times a year when all your favourite shows tried extra hard and pulled out all the stops to make their best possible episodes of the season.|"For those too young to remember, back in the days of linear television, Sweeps Weeks were special times of year when shows would be most heavily measured for ratings. These numbers were really important because they dictated the rates they could demand from advertisers. Shows would go all out to put their best foot forward, and by the late 90s and early 2000s this arms race got really extreme. This would be the week your favourite show would call up a huge guest star, or bring back a fan-favourite villain,  do a crossover episode, or splurge on things like big VfX (in a time when that was rare on TV), a live to air episode, or original orchestral scores.

I understand why services like Disney+ or HBO Max won't launch outside the US right away but Hulu has been around for so long and it's not even available in Canada for example. 
I live in Europe and from what I've seen we have Netflix, Prime and HBO GO/HBO Now here. And of course some local streaming services if you can call it that. They're all pretty popular and since there's only a few of them here I think Hulu would do good.
It seems like nowadays people use streaming services all around the world not just in the US or Europe so I wonder if there is another reason why Hulu won't go international?"|HalebLover|False|https://redd.it/ekx4iz|0|0.4|0|4|1|television

ekelan|2020-01-05 15:46:53|Twin Peaks: The Return is essentially a David Lynch variety show.|"I'm in the middle of my first rewatch of *Twin Peaks: The Return* since it aired.  Seeing it pop on all those best of the decade lists reminded me of just what a strange and wonderful experience the show was.  Maybe not the  return to the whimsical normalcy of the original series, but basically a it's a David Lynch variety show.  A celebration of his overall universe underneath the *Twin Peaks* banner.

Each episode features a variety of loosely connected vignettes and sketches set within the Twin Peaks universe - some featuring characters from the show, others featuring character who could very well have been from the show - structured around a vaguely defined theme and a musical guest.  All that's missing are those Log Lady intros to serve as the master of ceremonies.

Sure, there's a story being told. It's surprising how much sense it actually makes on a second viewing. It's kind of a Lovecraftian story about otherworldly creatures feasting on the destruction of the American dream. It's a comment on time, our human tendency to lose ourselves in fleeting moments and how the good times are as rare as a jackpot in a crooked casino. You could probably *also* say it's David Lynch thumbing his nose at the idea of reviving his old cancelled TV show.  Those moments are gone, and we'll never find them again.

All of that being said, it's probably best not to overthink it.  Twin Peaks is meant to be experienced.  David Lynch can clearly be heard laughing on the wind whenever someone tries to define what his work means. Some might need more weed/wine/cherry pie than others to get in the right headspace for it, and it's definitely not for everyone. I just think the best way to give it a shot is think of the opening credits as the house band warming up. and let the whole thing wash over you.  Like you're watching some bizarre, otherworldly variety show."|MR_TELEVOID|False|https://redd.it/ekelan|94|0.8|0|23|1|television

ek871v|2020-01-05 04:43:29|The Assets: ABC 8 part series from 2014. Is this worth watching (have to buy on Amazon) so wondering if it's worth it? Its about Aldrich Ames, the double agent.|"Yes or No?

NYT Review:

Acting, like spying, is the art of lying persuasively. 

And the British must be better liars, because they are constantly chosen to play Americans on American television shows. Their spies are obviously more interesting — [Kim Philby](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/455901/Kim-Philby), the infamous British intelligence mole, was a far more complicated and intriguing double agent than [Aldrich Ames](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/us/betrayer-s-tale-a-special-report-a-decade-as-a-turncoat-aldrich-ames-s-own-story.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm), the wormy counterintelligence officer who sold secrets to Moscow even after the Soviet Union collapsed. 

“The Assets,” an eight-part ABC mini-series about the Ames case that begins on Thursday, has British actors in almost all the lead roles, including Ames (Paul Rhys), but the creators are stuck with an American spy who over nearly nine years in the 1980s and ’90s got people killed and did terrible damage to the C.I.A., but wasn’t actually very mysterious at all. 

Mr. Ames, who is now in prison serving a life sentence, had a problem with drinking and money; he and his younger second wife had expensive tastes. Even [Robert P. Hanssen](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/robert_philip_hanssen/), the F.B.I. agent who sold information to the Soviets for two decades, had a richer back story: He was, among other things, a member of the secretive, conservative Roman Catholic society Opus Dei. (Chris Cooper played him in “[Breach](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/16/movies/16brea.html?_r=0),” a 2007 movie.) 

The real puzzle is not why Mr. Ames became a traitor, but how on earth he evaded detection for so long. His C.I.A. superiors missed all kinds of clues that he clumsily left in his wake, including flashy cars and clothes he couldn’t possibly afford on his government salary."|nmzb6|False|https://redd.it/ek871v|0|0.44|0|0|1|television

Then tonight my mom and I were watching TV around the same time, 9:40pm, and a similar ad played. The structure was the exact same except this time it said, ""Have you ever seen a ghost? Search for the answer."" This time my mom saw it as well so I know I'm not crazy.

I hear that the show gets really good in season 3 and I was having a decent time watching it (show felt like a guilty pleasure for me), but man do I hate pretty much every character right now.  
Quentin has been a selfish douche the entire season, Alice I liked until she cheated, Eliot is getting unbearable with his drug stuff, Penny is just the biggest asshole ever especially to Quentin for no real reason other than he's an ass.

I also just hated the whole entire cheating thing with Quentin, Eliot, Margo, Alice, and Penny.  
Just annoyed the shit out of me and felt like it made absolutely zero sense for the characters.

I watch shows where the characters are likeable (they don't have to be good people ex breaking bad) and who I can get attached to, but so far pretty much everyone on the show is insufferable and horrible to each other.

Does it get better or are the characters just always going to be dicks?

ejr7g8|2020-01-04 03:51:06|Dracula 2020 final episode, and what a relief (spoilers)|"So, I was after episode 1 and most of 2 quite hooked, for once, Dracula was not a romanticized tragic hero, shown as how he was described a monster posing as a man, a sociopath who held no illusions as to what he was, only being able to be civil towards humans for a brief period, hunger always won out over reason.

Episode 3 promptly decided to take what the last 2 episodes had built up to be a somewhat promising finale and beat it with a stick. With rusty nails in it.

I was hoping for something more, but what we got instead was a bunch of broken up gibberish, a lack of any real explanations along with (SPOILER)

A dying woman managing to TALK Dracula, the unrepentant monster, into commiting suicide by drinking her blood (what with it being poisonous because she was dying, think dead mans blood from SPN and you will get the idea).

Lucy gets turned but burned, and gets talked into suicide by proxy by a freaking selfie.

So it turns out Draculas big weakness is that he didn't die, I wasn't expecting a big buffyesque showdown, but honestly, a ripped curtain and a small breaking speech and Dracs all like ""oh might as well nibble on you then to kill myself""

I was hoping for more, such as Draculas attempt to escape from the foundation, but no, he got out because apparently a lawyer can wander in (who drac SKYPED) and say ""being a vampire isn't illegal, but you holding him is"" and he waltzes out, Dracula spent literally five minutes of screen time imprisoned.

Now, I feel something was missing, and I think I know what. Length, This miniseries suffered from being a miniseries, it suffered what was known amongst my friends as the ""season 8"" effect, not enough time, rushing through plot points that should of been episode long things by cramming them into segements of one episode.

I would say, 5 episodes would of covered this miniseries' bases, it suffered from it's short (even though each episode was feature length) lifespan. episode 1 and 2 worked very well, but the third fell very flat.

I get she is on tour with a singer, but come on! The show, IMO, is known for is quick, sharp, witty dialogue that keeps the pace high and is very engaging. You get a high paced, joke filled set from Midge and then it rolls into Shy Baldwin and what seems like a never ending musical break. It really brings the pace of a show to a halt and my wife and I are just sitting there like get back to the story.

One episode in particular, the where Lenny Bruce returns, has THREE musical breaks! One is shorter than the rest, and the other leads to a dance scene between the two, but you have two people who are known in the show for going back and forth and playing off each other very well (as shown in a scene of that episode where they are on a TV show) but we cut from them to show someone singing and it really kills the momentum for me.

It also doesn't have any of the story depends entirely on bad communication. You know like where the guy is seen by his wife out with some other girl so the wife gets mad but really he was only meeting the other girl to save someone's life or something. 


I'm probably not doing a very good job at explaining it but really the only way I can describe it is ""manufactured drama"" the shit that is supposed to make you sit on the edge of your seat but when you think about it for 2 seconds it's actually really stupid and unnecessary. The Wire depends almost entirely on story and dialogue. I'm having a really hard time thinking of any other show that does as much as The Wire.

Fucking Dracula's on Tinder? Also what the fuck is up with there being a gay guy in every single one of these episodes? This went from a solid B experience to D-/F.

I don't see an official discussion thread which is kinda weird?

Anyway, I wasn't very interested going in since the story's been done to death, but boy was I happily surprised.

Great atmosphere. Great visuals. Great acting. The characters are actually interesting.  Also, I love that it takes a lot of the existing mythos that was largely weaved out over the years (like having to invite a vampire in). Love that all the non-Dracula characters aren't just treated as lambs for slaughter and there is some actual good decision making. They question what legends are true, and if they are-- why is that? You know, kinda like how a normal person would.

Overall, very fun and I kind of wish I had waited til it's on Netflix to watch it all in one viewing. Btw shout out to Dolly Wells as Sister Agatha. Great character."|knight54|False|https://redd.it/ej4t4r|101|0.81|0|74|1|television

ej0ns3|2020-01-02 16:50:46|Brockmire is an incredibly underrated show. (Minor spoiler)|"I saw this show on the ""For You"" section of Hulu, and as someone who is a fan of Hank Azaria (Simpsons, Friends, Dodgeball), I gave it a try. At first I thought it was going to be a goof-around comedy with a slightly darker edge, but it wound up being so much more than that. While it is a funny and creative show, it does a great job of painting a much deeper picture of addiction, depression, and what rock bottom means for different people.

The show is about a Baseball announcer who, following a traumatic marital incident, has a meltdown and disappears off the grid for a while. He returns as a washed-up, alcoholic/drug addict and attempts to salvage a career from the rock bottom of his life. 

Everything from the dark humor to the character development, this show was an absolute masterpiece in humans stories. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes darker comedy with more substance to it than initially meets the eye. It is truly a quality feel-good show that sucks you right in.

The tone is for younger audiences (and great for adults too), but it just does what it does so damn well.

ej1sk7|2020-01-02 18:12:26|Parrot Analytics|"The articles using Parrot analytics get thousands of upvotes and comments as if they’re as meaningful as real ratings. I know people are desperate for any kind of numbers on streaming services, but all they’re doing is measuring social media activity, and we don’t know what their measure and weight is. For example when Nielson does Netflix ratings, the process of how they’re doing it makes sense. They put audio recognition software in some people’s phones and then use that as a sample. Most of the criticisms you can have for that method you can have for a Nielson box?

For example Parrot Analytics said Dickinson is the breakout hit of Apple but I just can’t see that being the case considering the hype leading for the Morning Show. I know it does well on Tumblr or whatever, but here are some of my own methods I came up with comparing See, The Morning Show, and Dickinson

Reddit sub activity: The Morning Show has 2.9k members and its season finale had over 600 comment thread. See has 1.8k members and its season finale thread had over 400 comments. Unless I’m missing a real sub somewhere, Dickinson’s sub has 186 members and is a dead forum, with less than 20 threads made since its inception.

IMDB reviews: See has 24,447 votes, The Morning Show has 17,436 votes, Dickinson 2,659 votes

Number of torrents: I’m not going to post the website but See is dominating with 800+ for its first episode, Morning Show has 350+ for its first episode, Dickinson has 9 for its first episode with the majority of its episodes after only having 1-5, albeit a “full season” torrent with over 100

I do not know how valid using these methods are, but it sure seems to me looking at that See is the bigger hit. The Morning Show’s numbers are likely underrating it since I would think the audience skews older which isn’t going to measure as well in the above metrics as for a GOT type audience like See. I’m not sure what social media demand activity Parrot could have dug up to change my mind since it seems like if anything sites like Tumblr are going to be affected by which type of audience it serves."|RusevReigns|False|https://redd.it/ej1sk7|20|0.73|0|19|1|television

ejbhec|2020-01-03 06:24:15|"""Disjointed"" is the perfect title for a show with a lot of different elements that never quite worked together"|"I'll preface this by saying that I quite enjoyed Disjointed. A friend of mine showed me the pilot on New Year's Eve and I binged the rest over the last couple days. It was unlike almost any show I've seen, for better and worse, to the point where I felt like I was watching two different shows. 

One show was a serialized comedy about the day-to-day operations of a dispensary. There were compelling characters of different ages and backgrounds, and bold depictions of complex issues like PTSD. This show defied the framework of a traditional sitcom, including visual sequences, commercial parodies and other weird interstitials. There was occasionally some stilted pro-pot dialogue that felt a little preachy even to someone who smokes, but overall had some interesting things to say about weed, the multi-cam sitcom, and the stigma surrounding both. 

The other show was a paint-by-numbers sitcom that catered to the absolute lowest common denominator. I'm talking contrived plots, painfully formulaic jokes, and a studio audience. It reinforced every negative stereotype about stoners (though Dank and Dabby are undeniably two of the funniest characters I've seen in years). This was exactly the show one could expect from a Chuck Lorre sitcom on Netflix: exactly the same, but more vulgar. The characterization was all over the place, the plots got exponentially more ridiculous over the course of a mere 20 episodes, and with the jarring tonal differences between (spoilers for the last few episodes) Ruth's boyfriend revealing he has months to live, and a sentient weed robot hell-bent on mind control and total dominance, it was hard for me to be fully invested in the show or the characters. 

Again, I did like the show quite a bit or I wouldn't have stuck with it. I was just disappointed that the show never quite found a way to put all the pieces together. It seemed like the end of season one was striking that balance, but season two was even more all over the place. It truly was disjointed, and not in the way the creators intended. 

Thoughts? I know I'm late to this show and that it didn't do well critically, but as much as I took issue with some of it, I don't think it was nearly as bad as some people made it out to be."|stopmakingsents|False|https://redd.it/ejbhec|2|0.61|0|3|1|television

ej5apb|2020-01-02 22:16:05|Spinning Out skates familiar ground with its abusive mother but lands emotionally|"*Spinning Out is an effective depiction of PTSD and bipolar disorder with a breakout performance by Kaya Scodelario*

Netflix’s Spinning Out depicts a figure skater (Kaya Scodelario) trying to keep her mental health spiralling out of control thanks to the pressures of the sport and overbearing mother Carol (January Jones). At times Carol who shares Kat’s bipolar disorder hits familiar beats for abusive parents in sports stories such as I, Tonya or Black Swan. She had her Olympic dreams torn from her, so she pushes her kids too hard to live it out through them. However they do allow Carol to show genuine remorse for her actions and point out the sacrifice she made waking up at 5 AM and working multiple jobs for a decade for her daughters to live their dreams. Jones is excellent showing the guilt after realizing she's gone too far, or turning on the charm in a moment for Serena's new coach (Will Kemp) who Kat is nervous will try to sexually exploit her sister.

The first episode rests on Scodelario’s shoulders and she’s terrific. Kat has bipolar disorder but also suffers from PTSD from a fall that derailed her Olympic dreams. She’s at a crossroads deciding whether to continue the dream wrecking havoc on her physical and mental body or to quit and follow her boyfriend to London. Her relationship with her younger sister Serena (Willow Shields) is only slightly less complicated than with her mother. Serena is now treated by her mother and coaches as the most promising skater of the family. Kat is both concerned about her safety from Carol and Mitch, but also competitive with her and fearful she may be better. Kat's friend Jenn (Amanda Zhou) makes an impression as she has to encourage Kat to continue skating while secretly knowing her dreams are ending. The skaters in this world are as vulnerable physically as mentally. At any point their bones could betray them and take away their Olympic dreams.

None of the male characters in the first episode are as complex as the three females in Kat’s family. Going forward pretty, rich, bad boy Justin (Evan Roderick) looks to be potential pairs partner and romantic interest for Kat. There’s also a coworker Marcus who has an obvious crush on her (Mitchell Edwards). Along with Serena's coach Mitch, Justin's father (David James Elliot) who Kat works for is played as a fairly stereotypical rich guy with a trophy wife (Sarah Wright).

There is a small town, down to earth feel to the world around Kat that makes it clear it’s either become an Olympic star or recede to a lower class life for her. The cinematography feels grounded and realistic. There are as many acoustic/indie songs as a This Is Us episode, although they contrast nicely with the skating sequences to classical music.

The story of falling down and making a comeback figuratively and literally, parents who cross the line training their sports children and romantic tension between skating partners isn’t entirely new. But thanks to a great lead performance by Scodelario the emotional journey deciding the future of her life and how she feels about her family members feels genuine.

ejhpi1|2020-01-03 16:26:36|What happens if there is going to be a television comedy drama series focusing on the decline of Daytime soaps|"Everyone, I have a thought. Since daytime soaps are on a decline and will be cancelled in about few years. I Wonder if there is going to be a drama comedy series in a tone of Netflix's Glow but focus on the daily struggles of the working cast and crew of a daytime soap during its decline unlike 	Sean Kanan's Studio city which is similar to the premise but didn't get more promotional material: [https://www.amazon.com/Studio-City/dp/B0831S9K6R](https://www.amazon.com/Studio-City/dp/B0831S9K6R)  and perhaps air on some streaming channels like Netflix for example. 

&#x200B;

Think about it, The show will focus on daily life struggles of the  cast and crew of a declining daytime soap during changing times as they try to keep the show ongoing while also focusing on their personal lives. Like for example an actor who is  trying to deal with his soap opera acting career while dealing with personal life with his girlfriend and trying to find another acting gig to get him his big break and a writer who has to deal with his personal life like his family for example.

&#x200B;

Also, the main protagonist would be a writer who ends up as one of the daytime soap writers in its declining years due to changing times. Also in the final season the soap is cancelled as the television company that broadcast its show tries to migrate it to streaming but to no avail, So the cast and crew will try to give the daytime soap a proper ending instead of the cliffhanger and the series finale will have the filming of the daytime soaps final episode with a wrap party and then the cast and crew went on their separate ways finding new careers  like every other people who are struggling in the post soaps world, while the protagonist will try to pitch his show to a streaming Channel based on his career as a daytime soap writer which is metafictional.

That is when the Nun character reveals herself to still be alive over 100 years later, in what presumably due to the technology is the present day.

After a whole film-length of a period drama episode, we are greeted with present day in a 'retelling' of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Nowhere in the trailer did we have any actual clue to what what gonna happen in the ending of this episode.

Why Moffat? Why. There is nothing that would be worse than you fucking up a plot again by placing it in the modern day out of the blew and overclocking each detail to confuse the watcher so god damn much. There is no saving a good show now that this has happened.

eizt5e|2020-01-02 15:45:35|Expanse writing (spoilers s4)|"The Expanse is a good show and I enjoy it. I am however often annoyed by the writing, and I'm wondering if it's just me because the reviews have been great.

I'm 8 episodes into season 4 and one thing I noticed is that the characters often do things that I consider unrealistically stupid. I remember this being an issue from the beginning. Some s4 examples:

* Naomi gets told she isn't taking to the gravity meds well. Alex is about to tell her that if she keeps this up she's going to die. She doesn't even let him finish his clearly very important thought and just continues to overexert herself. Who has this much disregard for their own health? Especially if they're supposedly very smart. Oh, and of course Alex makes no additional effort to convince her to calm down.
* Avasarala makes a political error by telling the public she fucked up. Frankly a rookie mistake. This was advice from her apparently incompetent campaign team. She clearly and rightly regrets doing this. A few episodes later, she does the exact same thing again.
* Holden and a bunch of others go to check on the guy that was on water purifying duty. He's dead. Someone else dies because a snail falls from the ceiling onto their face, instakilling them. Holden shines a flashlight on the ceiling which is clearly full of deadly snails. The whole group just stands there. No one runs for safety.
* The geniuses on the Roci and Barb come up with the brilliant plan to connect the two ships to each other. After all, the Roci has more battery so they can delay certain death a little longer. There's no long term plan, no attempt to make contact with anyone to come help them (don't tell me there's not enough battery to use the radio, but enough to pull an entire ship up into orbit).

That's all I could come up with on short notice.

And of course, the most annoying part is that no one seems to get punished for their mistakes.

So is it me? Do I have some weird personal vendetta against this show, or do the writers need to step up their game?"|gs101|False|https://redd.it/eizt5e|0|0.31|0|28|1|television

We know that Smallville Clark basically becomes the Christopher Reeve/Silver Age version. He's not the exact same person from those movies, obviously, but he's VERY similar. Dr Fate tells Clark that he will lead the heroes into the ''Silver Age'', we see Clark push a planet, but most of all, its the personality and aesthetic - we see the classic John Williams theme at the end of the show, we see the Daily Planet antics reminscent of the original Superman movie.

He basically becomes the Reeve era Superman, but in modern day. He's THAT type of Superman, rather than Post-Crisis.

Yet for so many years, Smallville was a teen drama. Its weird watching the early seasons, which act as a time capsule for early 2000s high-school drama, and knowing that this version of Clark will become reminiscent of the ones we see in the Reeve films."|throwawaysgkwm|False|https://redd.it/ei5mc3|121|0.87|0|76|1|television

If the show has to be cancelled for whatever reason, we should be given 2-3 episodes to wrap up the story.

This seems really unfair to me and leaves me not wanting to give them anymore of my money. I understand that the business model is to make as much money as possible, and that if the show isn't rating well it may not make sense for them to continue funding it, but for fucks sake - they should at least offer the fans a wrap up mini-series or something.

ehxsia|2019-12-31 04:25:56|Henry Cavill fucking killed it in The Witcher|"I know people are probably sick of seeing the show talked about on Reddit, but I was finally able to finish the show and just wanted to gush over Henry for a bit. Don’t worry, this isn’t a post gushing over the entire show about how it’s this amazing cinematic achievement (overall I liked it, but it definitely has some big flaws. I’d probably rate it a 7/10). But Henry brought his A game and it really showed. 

I remember when I first learned he was playing Geralt I went “really? Him?” and wasn’t really on board. But then I learned how much of a fan he is of the games and the books, and that gave me a little more hope. But I was still worried that I’d just see “Henry Cavill in a white wig”, and not Geralt. But I think he definitely brought Geralt to life. As an avid fan of the games, I was very pleased with how he was able to do a mixture of his own take while also paying tribute to Doug Cockle’s voice for Geralt from the games. He’s not perfect of course (but I think most of my issues with his performance would be more with the writing than his actual performance) but he showed quite a bit of range I thought he did a damn great job. I’m really looking forward to seeing him again."|WhiteWolfofUtah|False|https://redd.it/ehxsia|465|0.73|0|155|1|television

*So they go to this extra solar planet, and ppl belters inners  still hatting each-other little drama around,  the new planet seems like some old tech of planetary scale, dunno what came first, the tech in the planet or the planet ""around"" the tech*

*Sour our best boi ghost-detective actually was hijacked and he wasn't him actually until now but he is him now and he fixes the planet, oh on why it needed a fix well doesn't mater really now is fixed, i mean dead but ok i guess..*

*Oh and some terrorist->/revelation ex husband of our only girl, plans an devastating attack on earth, and the Indian woman earth-president lost the race to next presidency re-election*

*Oh oh and the mars soldier girl, yah so.. like actually if dint got it until now Mars is like a Soviet Union parallel, ppl there with lost cause selling their tech left and right after the cold war and she kinda was on the deals but not anymore in the end cuz some Mars peepz sold something really dangerous to some of  those OPA  belter terrorists*

**Grant Gustin**: Enjoyable enough in *The Flash*, and his current story arc of ""The Flash has to die"" is pretty dark.

**Rami Malek**: OK, so I haven't seen the new series but caught up on Season 3. Excellent as Elliot, the anti-social hacker protagonist. In 2020, what will be his next big role?


**Bradley Walsh**: Already a favorite of mine due to *Law and Order UK*, he's good on *The Chase* game show, but pretty good in *Doctor Who* alongside Jodie Whitaker, the Thirteenth Doctor.

**David Tennant**: Another one from *Doctor Who*, but was excellent in *Criminal* from what I've seen. I've not seen him in *Good Omens* yet.

**Aaron Paul**: I've seen him in *Breaking Bad* as Pinkman, but post-Breaking Bad he's good in *The Path* even if the characters are unlikeable *(*as some of my friends who've seen the show on Amazon Prime claim*)*, but is great so far in *BoJack Horseman*.

------

**Erin Shanagher**: Anglo-Irish actress who's one to watch, pretty good at what she does, was in a supporting role in *The Bay* alongside Morven Christie, and a major role in *Casualty*'s story arc.

**Jacey Salles**: Spanish actress on BBC drama *Casualty*, originally seen in ITV drama *Cold Feet*, now playing Spanish nurse Rosa. Not seen much of her, but she's good.

**Katie Clarkson-Hill**: New up-and-coming British actress, first saw her in *Trust Me* on BBC, but good for a newcomer.

**Donna Benedicto**: A newcomer I first saw on *The Good Doctor* and *Supergirl*, this Canadian actress is good.

**Susannah Streeter**: Not a big name, not an actor, and not an A-lister, but this BBC news presenter is bubbly, friendly and fun and looks younger than 43!

**Laura Bicker**: BBC news reporter with a Scottish accent that may be difficult to understand but she's competent and has delivered good coverage of sensitive topics, especially North Korea.

eirwqf|2020-01-02 02:32:09|The Witcher suffers from poor world building & character development. (Minor Spoilers)|"There is a reason why most successful Fantasy/Sci Fi epics from LOTR to the MCU start small and end big. They have to build up characters we care about, get to know them, and do a lot world building so we understand what the stakes are and why we should care about them. For whatever reason the show runners in The Witcher do quite literally the exact opposite & in doing so fumble the story badly. Right away they start big with these massive esoteric political machinations that it took other franchises years & multiple films to build up to, and here they just throw it all at you with no real care. Even the latter episodes where it begins to retrace it steps to attempt to explain it all isn't enough to make up for its jumbled and convoluted story line. Were they trying to be so different & unique that they thought that by telling the story out of order it would something really cool and avant garde? 

Ciri, the child princess on the run, has no character development. I think the show wants us to think that because we get a brief glimpse of her playing with street children shes kind of street smart? Then it shows her as being cold and alone trying to survive by herself but does she ever grow as a person? I can't tell based on the information the show gives us if we're supposed to think she was a spoiled brat who always got her way & now has to deal with the real world or was she always a tom boyish self sufficient person? I feel like I was getting mixed messages there. Who in the world were the people in the forest that took her in, what's their role in all this & why do they matter? None of this is explored or explained in any meaningful way. I never felt Siri was humanized once the entire time, she just matters because of her birthright & that was it. 

Yennefer's story arc came across like a chintzy Hallmark/SyFy made for TV movie. In the span of two episodes she goes from being a hunchback farm hand to an influential sorceress. Aretuza is no Hogwarts let just say that right now, and I know its not supposed to be, but they really just rushed her through there so we can finally see her as a beautiful and powerful witch DECADES later?! Her time in Aretuza should've been an entire season's worth of storytelling but they rushed it so she could have her romance with Geralt. In the final episodes Yennefer goes back as an alumni to her academy and there's this incredibly cheesy wizards council meeting where they throw around all this political and geographical jargon & we have no idea what any of it means. There is almost no attempt at any meaningful world building here so that in the final battle I have no idea of anyone's motivations or drives or what their cause for fighting for is. I want to care but it doesn't give me a reason to. 

I think in the end this first season is only salvageable because of how Cavil looks as Geralt. He has some neat sword fights but that doesn't make up for the fact that he is put in a world that never bothers explaining itself or him for that matter. The entire season I was waiting for that moment where we can understand his vulnerabilities and his self perspective in the greater world. We barely get glimpse of that in a minor flashback in the very end but it wasn't enough. As a major fantasy geek I really wanted to to like this show so I hope in the next season they fire script writer and hire better people. This obviously has the potential to be something better but they started off poorly. 

(I want to acknowledge this is its own unique IP & that though on based books and beloved games, is a TV show unto itself. I didn't judge it because of any preconceived notions that I had about the games or books)

EDIT: Now that I think about it the only other show I can recall recently that did this out of order storytelling was HBO's Westworld. In the first season it was a neat parallel timeline that paid off in the finale. However when it did it it still felt restrained and fluid that we really didn't always know if it was indeed a parallel timeline until the very end. They tried to ramp it up even more in S2 by messing with the timeline and I think it really didn't work the 2nd time around."|GenericReditUserName|False|https://redd.it/eirwqf|0|0.42|0|82|1|television
ei63sf|2019-12-31 17:43:50|Insomniac (2001) and the Digital Chasm|"We hear stories about old movies and TV shows being lost to time, failing to reach digital immortality, and it's eerie but whimsical because the media usually existed decades and decades before DVR; the tool that now means every modern thing under the sun exists somewhere online.

Would you be surprised to hear that a show that aired from 2001-2004 fell into the digital chasm?

Insomniac with Dave Attell was my favorite show in high school but there are now only 23 sad little VHS-rip episodes of it online; far short of the complete series.  Comedy Central decided they wouldn't release a complete DVD box set and even complete torrents of the show don't seem to exist.  

I can't be the only one who loved this show, who thinks it deserves a second life.

So, I'm here to appeal to the good people of /r/television.  Let's brainstorm some ways to solve this problem.  My first thought is to write letters to Comedy Central and Netflix since Netflix is the natural place for a show like this.  Urge Netflix to license the show from CC while simultaneously urging CC to license the full series to any streaming site.  I'll use the angle that nostalgia usually lags about 20 years behind so this is a prime moment for looking back to the 1999/2000 era.

Does anyone have any experience contacting these companies?  Any tips?  If I write to their general inquiry email addresses, I might as well just fold my letter into a paper airplane and throw it at their buildings.  Feel free to PM me if you don't feel like sharing your contacts publicly.

eimavq|2020-01-01 19:15:53|Here's an idea for a Mass Effect show (that's not entirely based on the games)|"Seeing recent TV shows like The Witcher, Mandalorian, Lost in Space etc. got me thinking that there is lots of potential for Netflix or HBO to get the rights to and make a Mass Effect show. The IP has a built in audience already, much like The Witcher or Mandalorian.  
  
The show's protagonist is David Anderson, and the show itself is set before the games, around the time after he had a divorce. The most right choice, since he plays an important role in them, but you know from the start that he has an unexplored history. I'm not a Mass Effect lore expert at all but I wouldn't be against retconning minor things about it either. I'd probably retcon David being heavily into the military first and give him more interesting and unique character traits.  
  
Season 1 is a slow burn character study, with an overarching plot of a murder mystery. I'm a fan of that, and noir, so the show is essentially a space noir. I know many people at first would expect an action heavy show (given Shepard and the games), but I think there's enough of that already. Similar to how Mandalorian is Star Wars' western, this would be Mass Effect's whodunnit, and would pay homages to movies and shows that were the first to do that.  
  
For the characters I'm thinking of David, and an Asari for whom he develops intense feelings, but the Asari character is conflicted and reluctant to get physical with David, because the knowledge that she'll live for a century while humans only live for around a 150 years depresses her and deep down she's scared to be in a relationship. I'm thinking more of a well developed romance rather than just an excuse to put in nude or sex scenes. Nothing sexual happens between them until the final episode, and their relationship is not exactly about sexual tension only, but more of a ""these two should be together"" and having found the person who is your soulmate, an idea that David didn't believe in before. I also find it important that the relationship is not defining them, both of them have lives, wants, desires, unique thoughts and actions that have nothing to do with each other. The third most important character this season is an artificial intelligence in a robot body, similar to EDI, they and David have a strong bond of friendship despite we, the audience and them not really knowing whether the AI in this universe can have feelings like this or not. No other B, C plotlines, most of the season is about these three.  
  
8 episodes. 4 episodes in, David and the Asari solve the murder mystery. It turns out that the artificial intelligence did it. The show's focus shifts to the characters now having to deal with moral questions that arise (think Star Trek TNG's ""Measure of a Man"". Bit different since Data did nothing wrong and I wouldn't have the show copy others, this is what smart writing is for). One of the big moments at the end of the season is the mind meld between David and the Asari, showing her character having been developed. Following seasons unfortunately would have to end their relationship, because there's no mention of it in the games obviously, so it's more of a Jimmy and Kim type thing. A sad ending to it, with her having to end things, because again it's inevitable that she'll outlive David.  
  
I'm thinking lower on the CGI use, same examples in The Witcher or Mandalorian all the practical stuff looks amazing (although a talented team like Lost in Space's would be great too). Most of the alien races can be done with prosthetics, except for the Salarians and the Krogans maybe, whose appearances would be rarer in the show. Cosplayers with lower budgets are already great at [making realistic looks](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ClV2loeVEAEkn4m.jpg) that work in motion too, shows like Star Trek are pretty good at it as well. I would probably put in one big CGI fight around episode 1-3, maybe with ships.  
  
No appearances by any of the original team members from the trilogy, or Andromeda. The show, while using a character from the games, is not a prequel to them. There would be many easter eggs for the players though.  
  
The aesthetic is inspired by the original Blade Runner movie, while still keeping the genre scifi. The soundtrack is influenced by the first Mass Effect game (lots of synthwave/darkwave/scifi keyboard). My focus would be on the cinematography, longer shots, and the dialogue.  
  
How does this sound for a show? There would be a lot of details obviously, this is the first idea from me on how it should be. Adapting the game trilogy or Andromeda wouldn't really work in my opinion, but this could be a big hit."|Codename_JackRyan|False|https://redd.it/eimavq|0|0.36|0|6|1|television

Sure, it may not get as much publicity as *The Witcher* or *Mandalorian*, but it's worthwhile to watch, it's part-psychological horror like *Mr. Robot* is.

ehn51f|2019-12-30 15:08:46|French, German and Scandinavian shows on Netflix are enjoyable, and it's interesting to see European TV outside of gameshows / panel shows.|"My *(*admittedly limited*)* experience of European television is mainly down to panel or game shows, such as Spain's *Espejo publico* presented by Susanna Griso, which is quasi-CNN like in tone.

However, since I got Netflix, I've started to binge-watch European mini-series or European dramas *(*sometimes subtitled, but some are dubbed into English*)*., starting with Russian sci-fi drama *Better Than Us* which had some good new actors I'd never heard of *(*I believe Vera Panfilova, who plays Zhanna/Jeanna, is like a Russian equivalent of Lily James - always in period dramas*)*.

I'm shortly starting *Deadwind/Karppi* which looks interesting, and covers the hot-button issue of climate change once you get past the cop-show premise, and will hopefully be seeing *The Bonfire of Destiny* which has Audrey Fleurot in *(*not an actress I'd heard much of before now*)* - it's interesting as it's about real history and an event I'd never heard of.


German drama *Bad Banks* with Paula Beer as Jana, an ambitious banker applying for her dream job looks interesting, and maybe a little Mr. Robot-esque in topic matter, at least about the corrupt banker part. Unfortunately it's not yet on Netflix or Amazon Prime so I'll have to wait for that one, but it seems interesting.

I don't think Amazon Prime has any European-sourced series in foreign language with subtitles like Netflix does, and Hulu isn't offered here in the UK.

ei7qgs|2019-12-31 19:40:43|Something I wish more shows would include today is a longer intro sequence.|"I know they can be annoying to people who prefer to skip straight to the show, but this has become less of an issue with streaming services + skip intro buttons. I think a long intro sequence allows the people behind the scenes to get really creative.

Two recent examples that come to mind are Game of Thrones and Stranger Things. They both have ~1 min per episode dedicated to just letting the theme song play alongside some cool visuals. I don't think either of those shows would be as popular if not for their iconic theme songs.

There are still tons of great shows out there that only show a title card + a snippet of music, but I think a lengthy intro sequence can give a show a more distinct feeling.

I recall that the main male star of the show, [Jon-Erik Hexum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon-Erik_Hexum) died at some point during filming, essentially shooting himself in the  head while goofing around with a gun loaded with blanks.  During the  episode called Golden Opportunity, Hexum is loading a gun with blanks  for a staged shooting that is happening later in the episode.  I think  to myself, is this the actual gun, the actual blank, that killed him?

In  the follow up episode, he has been replaced, and a tag at the end of  the episode memorializes him.  I realize my thoughts while watching the  last episode were likely correct, that was the actual gun, the actual  blank that killed him, made eternal through the (in this case dark)  magic of digital video.

I don't  really have a point, other than the fact that it quite creeps me out  knowing that I very likely watched a man play with a gun, that  eventually was part of his death, for my own entertainment.

eh2amj|2019-12-29 05:47:52|I need to talk about Mad Men. Spoilers inside.|"I just finished the finale tonight.  I watched the whole show in about the last two months and honestly it was excellent. The show was maybe a shade too long but it was all really well done and I need to express what I got out of it. 

The show starts out very straight forward and details the trials Don has faced in his past. Wasn't completely expecting how in depth they'd get into characters like Peggy and Joan but they're crucial in the series run and their triumphs highlighting the misogyny of the era. 

Earlier this year I was reading how when someone faces adversity in their lives they can identify more with their roots. This applies to Don because when work got hard he went back to California to find some form of comfort. 

Fast forward to the season 6 finale and I thought it was great how he almost lost his job and season 7 put him in a position where he had to fight for his job back. His recklessness divided his coworkers time and time again and now he had to pay the price. There was something rock and roll about the first half of the season, when shit hits the fan he can step up and deliver. 

When the major conflicts are resolved about halfway through the season that was the ending I was kind of expecting for the whole year.  I wouldn't have been angry if that was the big ending but then  they set up the next part of the season and I had no idea where they were going at first but then it became clear they were giving everyone their happy endings. The next ending I thought they were going to go with was having him start over again but with the tools to live a happier and more content life. Again I would have been happy with this. In the last two minutes I was pretty content that was where they were going with it and then they drop the bomb. 

Don making the coke ad put this finale into one of the best finales ive ever seen. It was a great use of exposition but on top of that it told us Don stopped running away from his demons and he went back and displayed his version of happiness to create the ad. He probably still lived a hard life after that but it was likely he'd be a better father.

ehritv|2019-12-30 20:23:02|The Witcher - Season 1 Review|"Here's an impossible task and I'm not even going to attempt it. I can't be objective about this franchise and my experience is most likely not yours. If it is your experience then you probably have already decided how you feel about this show. I have been in love with this universe and these characters since I picked up The Witcher 2 in 2016. That would later be cemented by The Witcher 3 and I'd end up diving into the novels (I'm still working through them). I am invested in the characters and the lore to an almost absurd degree. That being the case, it's impossible for me to discuss what this show is like and what the experience is for people who are brand new to this world and these characters. I have no idea if this is easy to follow or easy to track because my second-hand knowledge of everything surrounding this new show informs it extensively. 

&#x200B;

The biggest area where my aforementioned familiarity with the universe and the stories within it has to do with the fact that the TV is told to us out of order. There are 3 distinct focal points that exist throughout the timeline. There's a brief line in episode 1 that cues the audience in (if you're paying very very close attention) that the story is out of order. I had assumed as much from the start but that moment confirmed it. Casual viewers might struggle with this aspect until episode 4. Even then there are other timeline elements that they might miss, such as Yennefer being much older than she looks. 

&#x200B;

Speaking of Yennefer, she has the most amount of new story that has been developed for the show. There was only a single line hint to her backstory in the books and here that's been greatly expanded on with us not catching up to her as we met her in the books until episode 5 Bottled Appetites. This addition to my mind makes her the most dynamic character in the show. She's in a near-constant state of development and change. The actress playing her pulls this off wonderfully, giving this character the soul of someone who shows themselves as ice queen for having been hurt one too many times. It would have been much easier to read her character as cold and to get lost in the harder, and more manipulative side to the character. Fortunately, they handle her with a deft touch and lead her with a careful hand.  

&#x200B;

Geralt, the title character and Witcher is absolutely perfect. Henry Cavil is the best live-action version of this character we could have possibly asked for.  At no point did I ever see anyone other than Geralt. He absolutely nails the gruff exterior, soft heart, and cynical nature of the character. Lesser actors and lesser writers would have just given us a stock badass and left it there. I can't state it enough how much this is the character as Cavil balances both the portrayal from the games and how he exists in the books, giving us a perfect blend. all the way down to little sarcastic oneliners and ""Hmm."" 

&#x200B;

The final character of the big 3 is Ciri. Freya Allan might have the hardest job in the show. Her character by comparison to the others has the least meaty material to work with and has to convince us as to the heart of this character that will be revealed as the character develops. To my mind, she pulls it off beautifully. Most of her character in this season is in a constant flight mode and running from the Nilfguardians. She should be given all of the credit because I know where they're going and I think she's going to do great when we get there. She's doing a wonderful job now, but there's not much to work with. 

&#x200B;

The side characters are almost universally excellent with the absolute standout being Joey Battey's Jaskier. (Dandelion for the game fans) I loved every single moment where Jaskier and Geralt got to share a scene. The energy is perfect, even if the origins of the meeting have been changed. Geralt may claim that he's not Jaskiers friend and Jaskier will remind us that Geralt lets Jaskier rub oils on his lovely bottom. Jaskier and Geralt have such palpable chemistry as friends and he shouldn't be overlooked. Without him, we might not remember to toss a coin to our witcher. 

&#x200B;

Tissaia and Calanthe are also stand-outs with Calanthe being the unexpected highlight of the non-Jaskier side characters. These actresses deserve every bit of credit given to them. Tissaia captures the difficulties of running Aretuza and the complicated relationship with Yennefer as both her tormentor and guardian. Calanthe is everything she should be, even if the show doesn't have much room for her more strategic edge present in the books. She encapsulates the arrogance, bravado that comes with her position and it creates a strangely likable character that you might end up rooting against, despite knowing her eventual fate as soon as episode 1. 

&#x200B;

Finally, the other side character to talk about are Triss, Cahir, and Vilgefortz. Triss is good. The important distinction to make is that she plays a much smaller role in the books and her character underwent a few changes for her appearance in the games. She really only has one episode and she works well. She'll take on a larger role but I'm not going so far as to cry miscast given that she's only had a single episode as a side character to explore her. Cahir and Vilgefortz have the same problem for the most part. They just don't get enough time to really dive deep. Cahir especially has been positioned as the bad guy for the season. I understand the need but the writers are going to have a challenge ahead of themselves to make him sympathetic after his villainous first season. Vilgefortz is in the same category, not really enough time to dig into his character although it does become clear that he's dangerous and on the wrong side. His more psychopathic nature is still hidden for the most part in the show. 

&#x200B;

Everything surrounding the show's production is flawless. Aesthetically the show is almost perfect, I'm not a fan of the Nilfguardian armor but it doesn't take me out of it like some people have complained about. The monster design is wonderful and I can't wait to see more of them in the future (I'm waiting on lesser vampires and werewolves). 

&#x200B;

My final complaint regarding this season is that it ends too early and we have to wait so long for the next one. As far as complaints go, that's one I can stomach easily. 

&#x200B;

the show has a really solid foundation to build from. As a fan of this universe and these characters, I am completely satisfied and elated that it's getting mainstream attention. Friends that didn't know anything about the Witcher can discuss Yennefer and Geralt. It's been a long time since something that existed in a niche has gotten this much mainstream appeal and new fans. I'm loving it and I'm eagerly awaiting the next season."|CatySecuirty|False|https://redd.it/ehritv|0|0.36|0|15|1|television

If you could only recommend one which would it be?

This is a question I have seen around on different war movie/series discussions on reddit as well as other forums. All three of these are so different…. How could we possible decide which one is the one to “recommend”? Well recommendations often differ depending on the receiving individuals’ personal tastes… So, lets try to answer which one of these three amazing shows was… the BEST.

I decided to write this because as someone who was busy and looking for answers to this question myself, I just couldn’t find a good answer. Most people seemed to just go with BOB because of nostalgia…

WARNING SPOILERS

SPOILERS WARNING

To do this I decided to score each series using the following criteria: 1. Good Story 2. Grittiness

3. Suspense 4.Originality 5. Profound Message 6.Realism/Accuracy 7. Good Actors 8. Graphics/Special effects 9. Complexity  10. Soundtrack

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**The Pacific**

1. Good Story 7/10

This series tried to take on a gigantic war (LITERLALLY SPREAD ALL   OVER THE PACIFIC) and follow men from multiple companies. While the individual stories are all really   good it can be jarring for viewers. In   addition, “the enemy” Japanese soldiers are almost inhuman BONZAAAII!! machines.

Despite these things the series does hit us hard emotionally multiple   times. This is not a feel-good war   movie and does accurately convey what it must have felt like in the Pacific   at that time.

2. Grittiness 10/10

Some of the fighting later in the series that takes place in Okinawa   was absolutely tragic. I felt like I   was there…I felt stressed…. I couldn’t believe it. There is literally a scene where FREDDIE   MERCURY is throwing stones into the remains of a Japanese soldier’s blown   away skull…..all while resting and smoking a cigarette.

3. Suspense 7/10

Lags… This series has lots of downtime. But the scenes of warfare are masterfully   done on par with Saving Private Ryan. Actually,   I would argue that some of the scenes are even better than the SPR.

4. Originality 8/10

The scale of this was massive. The budget was massive. The choice   to follow men from multiple companies was unique… SO many story lines in a 10   episode series.

5. Profound Message 9/10

War is truly hell. You feel it when the boys go home. War changes each of them in different ways   but it takes away from all of them or their families. This one does not leave you “feeling good”.

6. Realism/Accuracy 10/10

As an American who lives in Japan and has viewed the war form both sides.   I would say this was pretty accurate. The Japanese fought “TOTAL WARFARE” … which was very different from   the Western countries style of warfare… then the Americans matched the   Japanese style… and the war became absolutely brutal… This series shows that pretty well..

7. Good Actors 8/10

Amazing cast… amazing characters.

8. Graphics/Special effects   10/10

Episode 5 ""Peleliu Landing"" reminds me of the opening scene   of SPR when they hit Normandy. Except   this scene shows a boy morph into a soldier within the episode. Amazing stuff. Amazing graphics.

9. Complexity 7/10

This was a complex war because it was fought all over the pacific. But without a real background in understanding   the Pacific War, one might be easily confused.

10. Sound Track 8/10

Pretty good stuff. The fighting   scenes felt like video game music which I found engaging. Main theme song is your classic classical   stuff - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E-6Qd0wJlQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E-6Qd0wJlQ)

TOTAL SCORE:  8.4

The more I watched, the more invested I was. If you can overcome some of the gaps of no   action you might get emotional investment in the characters. Personally, I became invested in Sledge…. Very   much so. This made the series   unforgettable for me. **Got a smoke? Thanks, Sledgehammer.**

**Band of Brothers**

1. Good Story 10/10

Can’t really knock the storytelling of this one. Each episode opens up with the real men in   their old age previewing what is to come. The whole story is pretty cool and the way each episode focuses on one   character was quite original. Made you   invested in the characters.

2. Grittiness 5/10

Aside from finding the concentration camp and one or two other scenes…this   was not very gritty in my honest opinion. The action itself was not… that intense. The hardest scenes were the episode that   focused on the Doctor but it wasn’t as gritty as it was emotional.

3. Suspense 5/10

Personally, I didn’t find this series very suspenseful till the middle. This was more about storytelling from the   men’s perspective. There is some   amazing stand out scenes but I wouldn’t call this suspenseful by any means.

4. Originality 10/10

Each episode focuses on a different character. Each episode opens with real veterans   telling stories. It follows the Easy   company through their entire campaign. I would call this an original War story.

5. Profound Message 7/10

This one honestly left me feeling pretty good. The show touches on some of the horrors of   war but in the end…this didn’t feel horrible. In a way this was a patriotic series for American viewers. There was not a “Central” message. Just storytelling.

6. Realism/Accuracy 9/10

The medical scenes, the long episodes of just staying a fox hole, the   cost of simple mistakes, yeah it seemed pretty accurate. I would also like to point out that after   watching the Pacific, I found this side of the war to be… almost glamorous comparatively.

7. Good Actors 10/10

Amazing Cast…. don’t really need to go into detail here.

8. Graphics/Special effects 8/10

This is where I felt the series   could have used better directing. There is a lot of shooting and running, almost like watching people   play paintball. I wish they could have   done more here.

9. Complexity 7/10

The overall story isn’t that complex but it does attempt to paint a   long campaign in just 10 episodes

10. Sound Track 9/10

Pretty damn good and gives you the feels. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxyl0eVDUJM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxyl0eVDUJM)

TOTAL SCORE:  8

This was a good series and I became emotionally invested in the   characters towards the end. It doesn’t   leave a bitter taste in your mouth, so I would recommend it to “anyone”. **This is like “The Sandlot” of war movies.**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**Generation Kill**

1. Good Story 10/10

This is as real as it gets. I   grew up with this generation and quite a few of my buddies went off to Iraq/Afghanistan   and talking with them this paints an accurate portrayal of what some of them   went through. I believe this would be   an excellent film to show anyone prior to signing up for the military. Afterwards if you can ask em, “Is that what   you want ?”.

2. Grittiness 7/10

This was gritty in a whole different way.  Innocent dead women and children. It was more of a passive grittiness in a   way. The soldiers weren’t really going   through “HELL” in a direct way but you could feel it was hell nonetheless.

3. Suspense 5/10

This one also lagged but then again it was supposed to! If we could replace this category with “comedy”   then it would get 10/10. But it says   suspense and therefore gets a lower score. Essentially the entire series is a bunch of marines looking for a   fight but never *really* finding it.

4. Originality 10/10

This shows you what the CORE is really about. I highly recommend this to anybody   interested in the genre.

5. Profound Message 9/10

War is completely unfair. Especially in the modern era. Also,   war in the Middle East is beyond the average persons understanding. Its beyond my understanding and probably   beyond your understanding. Why the   hell are we there?

6. Realism/Accuracy 10/10

Very realistic.. This show has   been vetted by many vets as being as real as it gets.

7. Good Actors 7/10

A couple of unforgettable characters but overall the series doesn’t capitalize   enough on some of them.

8. Graphics/Special effects 7/10

This seemed a bit lower budget in some ways. Not a lot of action was really   required. But this is probably an   accurate portrayal of the war.

9. Complexity 9/10

I personally found the story itself fairly complicated. We had a bunch of guys in Humvees looking   for a fight. Their leader was looking   for an excuse to get them in a fight. Orders kept changing. Some   choices by command didn’t make any sense. It was complicated when it didn’t have to be. Probably much like the war.

10. Sound Track 10/10

The soldiers singing pop songs from the early 2000’s. Let the Ha@&\*s hit the floor. The Happy Song… I mean this series definitely delivered in   terms of music and realism. Especially   when the characters sing… [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUL56mPFIkk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUL56mPFIkk)

TOTAL SCORE: 8.4

This series is full of foul language and ignorant statements. If you cant handle that, then you cant   handle a real look at the Marine Core. I would recommend it to someone who loves war movies only. In a way it is a good war otaku flick. **“The incompetent leading the unwilling to do the unnecessary.”**

Overall, I got to say that personally “The Pacific” was my favorite. If I had to recommend one to general people I would go with Band of Brothers.

This makes me what to discuss  four of the  remaining US  Daytime soaps like General Hospital, Days of Our Lives, The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful will switch their format to primetime and streaming.

Because daytime soaps in the US are on a decline especially when women who were the main demographic have gone to other places to work instead of staying at home including men, Budget is low, Storylines becoming unrealistic which is used for escapism to attract viewers, Rise of reality shows, People use streaming and most are familiar with the usual clichés in daytime soaps that people are bored with daytime soaps.

So if the four daytime soaps will switch the format to primetime then this will not only help improve the show with better budget and better quality with good storytelling but also help to win more viewers since they prefer to watch shows at night especially streaming service since it is the mainstream now, So that daytime soaps will not only regain their popularity but many people will still watch the shows during their break, work or at home.

I just finished watching Don’t f*** With Cats on Netflix, and a couple of things aren’t sitting right. I’m mainly focusing on ‘Manny’ and his links with the series. Obviously Manny appears to not exist, but in that case:

- Who beat Luka? The photograph showing injuries to Luka’s face was supposedly by Manny. If not, then who? 
- Is the list of things Manny reportedly did to Luka a complete lie? 
- If Manny doesn’t exist, who did Luka take the videotape of the murder out to? Luka said Manny was outside in a black SUV, so where did the tape go?
- Manny and his friends supposedly drugged and raped Luka and took him across the country. Why is this not mentioned again in the series? Was this a complete lie? 
- Someone else’s hands may be visible in the bath video. Who is this?
- Who sends the Facebook message identifying Luka by name? Was it Luka himself? Or somebody else?

Also: 
- Why was the torso that was found in the suitcase described as a white male, when Jun Lin was Asian?
- How did John get the CCTV footage from the Berlin internet Cafe and upload it to the Facebook group before ‘Baudi’ had even found out Luka had been caught?
- And finally; could Luka seriously do it all on his own?

We all know how long we spend looking for something to watch. Scrolling through countless options trying to find something worth your time (and that works for your SO).

Well, with Amazon and Apple, don’t get your hopes up when you see that movie/TV show you’ve been wanting to watch. There’s a strong chance it won’t be included and will instead cost at least a couple bucks to rent/buy. After Netflix and HBO, that’s just not something I’m willing to do on a paid subscription service. 

There’s no way to exclude for-pay options from appearing, a real problem when you want to see suggestions for similar titles. For example, on Amazon I saw Goldeneye was included; great! let’s see what other Bond movies are included by looking at “Customers also watched”; all the Daniel Craig Bond movies are available too!! ...for $3.99 to rent... Nevermind. How disappointing. 

It’s especially bad with Apple TV+ because that service has so few options that are included. There’s literally about 8 TV shows and 2-3 movies. Everything else you scroll past is for purchase. Idk who the hell is paying for that subscription unless they really just looove “Newsroom 2: Morning Edition”.

Edit: wow, I guess some people really like Prime Video and Apple TV+. I suppose the overall point of my post isn’t just to complain about shitty user experience, it’s to say that these companies are trying to compete with Netflix but providing a totally inferior experience."|mylarturban|False|https://redd.it/egyxni|21|0.61|0|37|1|television

eguvg4|2019-12-28 19:20:27|The Witcher isn’t as good as Reddit keeps making it out to be. The Critics aren’t completely wrong. [SPOILERS]|"Before the show officially released, The was a review that said “The Witcher makes GoT look like 2 hobos fighting over a sandwich...”. Obviously the poster was a bit excited, or still pissed about season 8 of GoT. Either way, Netflix’s new flagship isn’t a bad show, but it’s also not the greatest. Let’s break it down:

Spoilers below:

Alright, so the timeline of the the show is all over the place. It wasn’t until maybe episode 5 or 6 that I began to understand exactly what timeline each set of characters were in, as the show DOES NOT make this apparent. That’s not a bad thing, however. Happens all the time. The problem that arises is that character development was summarized in about 1-2 episodes and then boom, here we are with ‘fully developed’ characters, mainly Yennifer. Her transformation from lowly pig-girl to powerful and beautiful mage was just barely covered. Her beginnings were shown and how she got to the mage ‘school’, but then the next time we see her, she already knows all the spells, been advising her king for years and is some kind of sex addict. All of this happening with not having been covered in the show, meaning the writers just hope viewers understand Witcher history or have played the games. 

I guess what I’m saying is this. The Witcher, in my humble opinion, is nowhere near as good as GoT, which built a world and such rich backstories for so many characters. The Witcher can become much better in my book if next season they slow down the lightspeed storyline advances and focus on character development. Yes, the swordplay is great, but it can’t be all action all the time. 

Overall, I’d score The Witcher a 7/10

Personally 2010s is my favorite. From a drama perspective it drinks the milkshake of a couple of the shows 00s are known for (Breaking Bad/Mad Men) with a lot of great ones that started this decade (Once Upon A Time, American Horror Story, The Walking Dead, Halt and Catch Fire, This Is Us, Succession are my favorites). From a comedy perspective I prefer 2010s as I feel the medium evolved beyond sitcoms in a lot of ways, I'm a fan of Community (started technically late 2009, but basically 2010s show), Louie, Mindy Project, Broad City, The Good Place. I think if you only counted shows that started in each decade 2000s has a good case though since it would claim sole rights to some shows like BB, Mad Men, Community, etc."|RusevReigns|False|https://redd.it/egw3f5|10|0.68|0|36|1|television

eh8jmp|2019-12-29 17:23:15|"I have a hard time finding much of ""The Office"" humorous because I find Michael Scott to be a deeply dysfunctional and profoundly tragic character."|"People say Michael is ""cringe humor"" and if you don't like cringe humor you might have a hard time with The Office. 

I don't really see it that way. I don't find most scenes with Michael remotely humorous or cringey. I find them tragic and extremely painful to watch. 

At his core Michael is a good person who wants friends, and to be cared for and liked, and who wants a family and a rich emotional life. 

The problem is that he is so deeply disturbed, and so emotionally dysfuntional that those desires are impossible. He is a narcissist with no real sense of how to connect emotionally to anyone anywhere. He has no sense of what is or is not appropriate behavior, no idea of what is or is not creepy and weird or condescending or pushy or totally off putting. None. 

So in his never ending quest to emotionally connect with other humans he constantly shit the beds, over and over and over and over. And what is truly tragic is that he never seems to learn from these things. He never seems to have an ounce of self reflection to say ""Yeah photoshopping myself into a picture of Carol and her family, replacing her ex-husband, could come off as creepy and intrusive"" 

Nope. He just burns down every relationship he ever has, never learns a damn things from it, and then goes guns blazing into the next emotional misadventure never having learned a damn thing. 

I just can't find any of it funny. Its just too depressing and too tragic for me to find humorous. I AM NOT SAYING OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT FIND IT FUNNY. Its fine if you do. I am just explaining my position here. 

That ep where he meets to waitresses, gets them confused with earch other repeatedly, tries to connect to both, fails miserably as they both think he is weird and a bit creepy, then gives one a bicycle she didn't ask for and she rides off leaving Michael alone. 
 
Whats funny about that? Its just sad and tragic. A lonely man with no real ability to connect, and no real ability to improve. Its a depressing episode to me. 

I could go on but perhaps I made my point. Sooooooo many funny scenes and funny characters in this show. Hilarious scenes left and right, but....Michael? No."|Bluest_waters|False|https://redd.it/eh8jmp|0|0.4|0|42|1|television

eh8r2l|2019-12-29 17:38:47|I watched Twelve 2019 shows. Here are my opinions on them.|"I watched twelve shows that came out in 2019. Here they are ranked from best to worst in my personal opinion, with some added notes as to why.

Watchmen Season 1 - Best of the year by far. Incredible storytelling using very well developed characters. Deserves a ton of awards. Will keep you guessing until the very last scene. Worth paying for HBO for this alone.

Euphoria Season 1 - I was hesitant to put this so high up, but the technical aspects of how well the show is made is enough for me. They do a lot of creative camera work and cinematography, bordering on daring and risky. My only complaint is that the characters are in no way teenagers.

The Boys Season 1 - Biggest surprise of the year for me. I thought it was going to be a stupid fun action show. It was definitely that but its also so much more with a world I want to explore more and characters I want to see kill more. Can we talk about how Homelander is a better superman than superman?

Love, Death, and Robots Season 1 - This should probably be higher. Way higher. Artistic and beautiful. There was only really one or two episodes I didn't think were completely amazing. The longest episode is about twenty minutes so why are you wasting time reading this and not watching this show?

Peaky Blinders Season 5 - This is pure personal preference. Either you like the show and liked this season, or you have never heard of the show and don't care. It tackles some relevant themes, has a great soundtrack, and Cillian Murphy is still beautiful.

Good Omens Season 1 - Definitely the ""fan favorite"". I was shocked at how much chemistry David Tennant and Michael Sheen had. They clearly cared about the show and it carries it through questionable CGI and some humor that falls flat.

Umbrella Academy Season 1 - Another surprise for me. Very good non-linear storytelling. Lots of creative set pieces. It is honestly a better character study than a story though.

Atypical Season 3 - This is the most feel good show I watched. I like the direction they are going with the show but I am worried at this pace it is going to burn out fast and I hope they don't ruin it with countless seasons.

Stranger Things Season 3 - Absolutely did not need to happen. I don't think the season was bad and there were elements I could appreciate but in no way did this have to happen. I don't know if there is a season 4 scheduled and I do not care. Stop milking a dying franchise.

Lucifer Season 4 - I don't even remember much of this. I remember I laughed a few times and thats about it. Nothing special that will stick with you forever. Pretty much the same thing as every other season.

Black Mirror Season 5 - This show lost its identity faster than I could turn it off. Episodes are at best confused and at worst completely non-sensical.

Game of Thrones Season 8 - We all know it. Great drama storytelling that flopped when the source material ran out. I don't have anything to say that hasn't already been said a thousand times. Watch another fantasy show instead."|lct-v|False|https://redd.it/eh8r2l|0|0.29|0|13|1|television

egnbwr|2019-12-28 06:25:39|The Mandalorian is Really Great, Just Not What We Expect in This Era of TV|Just my thoughts on the Mandalorian. Still haven't caught up on it yet, but I'm on episode 6. The show is really good at being a western, which is what Favreau and the creators have said was a big inspiration for the show. It has the same vibe that shows like The Lone Ranger or Gunsmoke have, with stories that are (for the most part) single episode stories. Just a lone gunslinger comes into town in the midst of a chaotic world, is dragged into whatever conflict is going on, and just tries to survive or help the townsfolk. It has an incredibly high production value, but I feel like nowadays, we expect these shows to have some complex stories, but this doesn't. It has great characters that we're starting to understand and learn more about. Most of the criticism I've seen about the Mandalorian is that it doesn't fit that mold, but it doesn't have to. It isn't what we expect nowadays, but it's not trying to be.|_What_am_i_|False|https://redd.it/egnbwr|35|0.54|0|168|1|television

egyv46|2019-12-29 00:35:29|Why can't TV streaming services be more like Spotify?|"Compare and contrast:

Spotify: I pay my membership fee. It has every bit of mainstream music that anyone cares about from the last... Oh I dunno.. the last FOREVER? It's got recordings of things from the 1900s on there! If I choose to switch to a different steaming provider then all the same content is there and there's like 90% parity between the two services anyway so I'll just use whichever one my phone plan or my bank or whatever is giving me for free. If I want to listen to Fall Out Boy then I can literally pay ANY SERVICE and they will give me the sweet sweet mid 2000s emo loving.

Netflix: I pay my membership fee. It has... Some things? Like some TV shows and a few movies? But then if I go abroad the selection of content is totally different, and then without any notice some shows and movies just get randomly removed or added, seemingly depending on the whim of some chaotic god. If I switch platforms then the selection of content is **totally different** and if I want to actually watch everything new that's available I have to spend something along the lines of $150 a month?


I know the short answer to this is ""licencing is complicated"" - so I guess my real question is: If the music industry can get it's shit together why can't the film/TV industry follow suit?


Or to put it all another way: If I want to listen to Fall Out Boy then I can literally pay ANY SERVICE and they will give me the sweet sweet early 2000s emo lovin'.

egtqmj|2019-12-28 17:52:10|[SPOILERS] Do you guys really 'love' Mr. Robot?|"I've just finished the last episodes of season 2, and I've been zapping through nearly every episode; e.g. skipping 30 seconds of unnecessary scenes, etc.

I've got a few questions;

**Why is EVERYONE an asshole?**

There's no-one to root for in the entire show. Darlene is a bitch; Elliot says about 2 words every episode; Tyrell Wellick beats up homeless for $300 and kills the new CTO's wife (which, from every logical standpoint would STILL not make him CTO); Joanna Wellick has sex with everyone she wishes and 'falls in love' with some random guy from a bar (which is casually explained after some naked BDSM scene). Additionally, some bullshit ass 'earrings' scene explains the first date with Tyrell, which explains how Tyrell takes any steps necessary for something he or his wife wishes to achieve.

**Why is EVERYONE unstable, suicidal and extremely leftist?**

No-one seems to provide the world with any good?? So the 'largest conglomerate in history' happens to be based on only evil stuff? How can a company grow so large from being evil and screwing over people like all the time? No riots have taken place before the ""Five/Nine"" hack (?); considering the fact that they're sooooooooo evil.

**Why is EVERYTHING misleading in this show?**

Why would you purposely mislead the audience, like, permanently? There's very rarely something that doesn't come from Elliot's or anyone's illusion, for that matter. There's no chronological logic or whatsoever in the entire show.

**Why is this show being branded as a 'hacking show'?**

I started watching Mr. Robot because of the great reviews and hacking standpoint the show would convey, however, there's about 2% of hacking in the ENTIRE show.

**Why is this the most slow-paced show I've ever watched?**

Mr. Robot is filled with useless dialogue, terrible analogies, terrible attempts to associate philosopy and behaviour to computer science concepts, I've literally felt like skipping about every 3 minutes halfway through a scene.

&#x200B;

I'm not even going to bring up the technical inaccuracies, sure, 5 unstable junkie 'hackers' splurt out 3 Kali Linux commands and take out the biggest conglomerate in the world??? Wtf man. Sure, let's connect a raspberry pi to some electrical cable and we've got the complete server room climate control system compromised.

**There's no logic in this entire show, and, quite frankly, I'm done.**"|BleepBlob|False|https://redd.it/egtqmj|0|0.32|0|39|1|television

While this show is still relatively young and has garnered a lot of critical acclaim from critics, I feel it has gone under the radar to everyday show watchers. 

The show masterfully navigates a criminal ring, while also showing a side we rarely see with these types of shows: human emotion. The acting and cast are phenomenal, and not only puts Jason’s Batemans acting’s chops front and center, but also shows his ability’s as just a creator in general being one of the creators of the show. 

In my opinion (and it’s just that), Ozark is Netflix crowning achievement, and I can’t wait for season 3!

efwsyt|2019-12-26 15:39:00|Lost in Space's Second Season is a vast improvement|"I actually liked Season 1.  It had ridiculously high production values.  I liked to joke it looked like they shot in on an alien planet.  It was written for kids so the lack of writing depth didn't really bother me.  I knew what it was and it was pretty entertaining. Plus the robot has a fucking awesome design.  
  
When I saw the first trailer for Season 2 I was excited to watch another season of this crazy expensive kids show. I didn't really expect an improvement in the writing and I honestly didn't care.  I like the visuals.  I like the guy that plays the dad.  I like the robot.  The main kid isn't a bad actor. I was just down for more of the same.  So imagine my surprise when I started it up Tuesday and the logic isn't really dumb anymore.  
  
All the convenience that the first season used to push the story forward is actually explained this season.  There's a reason for this stuff to actually happen now.  The characters seem more like actual people.  They make decisions that actually make sense.  In the first episode the mother has this batshit insane idea that they would have just done in Season 1, and the dad just dismisses it outright.  ""Why would we risk our ship and the lives of our family just to leave a little sooner?""  It was a rational reaction that wasn't remotely present in the first season.  Obviously, they still did the insane thing but the show gave them an actual reason for it too happen.  
  
So the second season is actually an improvement on the first season.  Its still a kids show but its written better.  Its not as dumbed down as it was the first season.  The visual effects are better than they were in Season 1 and honestly better than some big budget movies.  The [](#s ""Space Whale"") should honestly get them a damn award.  The show is leaning deep into the backstory on the robots which is fucking awesome and Dr Smith isn't insufferable anymore.

efq9vr|2019-12-26 03:41:36|Why aren't more people discussing The Witcher and Mr Robot?|"I'm really bothered by the fact nobody is talking about these shows at all or comparing them to shows not like them at all very much. 

The Wire was a complex drama looking at the different levels drugs affect Baltimore, from the dockworkers to the homeless to the police and media. 

Obviously this is exactly like and suitably comparable to a mentally ill person destabilising the global economy while working with terrorists who have a transgender leader who believes in the possibility of a multiverse. How that isn't obvious and something everyone should be repeating, I don't know. To me they are virtually the same story, like watching different versions of A Christmas Carol.

Also, a story about a mutant monster hunter with three main characters is obviously very similar to a story with at least 8 main characters and over 300 in total that's based on the War Of The Roses. Also, the lead in The Witcher wears a white wig and so did Daenerys Targaryen and they are both friendly towards dragons so there's that as well. They both have dragons and manticores in them and are based on books so it's best to ignore their vast differences and only focus on that they have magic, monsters, swords and castles.

In the top 100 threads on here there's only about 20 threads about these two shows, which hardly seems fair. By comparison, there's only two about that same Peep Show scene about the turkey that gets reposted every 3 weeks anyway.

Can we all agree that we need to discuss and make new threads constantly about these shows? I have enjoyed them for the most part and we need more focus on these shows. 

I'm tired of everyone talking about Joe Pera Talks To You, Forged In Fire, Laff Mob's Laff Tracks and Fastest Cars In The Dirty South. 

There are just too many of those, it gets boring and repetitive unlike bringing up that Henry Cavill cut water weight to appear in a scene where he's bathing which is scintillating to continue discussing in 9 different threads.

With that in mind, compared to Game of Thrones, The Witcher isn't holding up very well for me. I think it's getting a pass because of The Witcher brand. If this was a show with a different name, I'm not sure it'd be reviewed so kindly.

For a Netflix flagship series, everything looks a bit cheap. The sets *look* like sets. Nowhere looks lived in. It's hard to immerse yourself in the world when everywhere looks like a studio.

The story is confusing. I'm having trouble following what's going on. After three episodes, I was hoping it'd become clearer but I'm still left with a lot of questions.

The one positive is that Cavill is a great Geralt. I know nothing of the books/games but I feel like Cavill has brought Geralt to life enough that I'm happy to follow him.

eghz1v|2019-12-27 22:28:26|The Following deserves to be talked about alongside The Wire/Breaking Bad/The Sopranos, but the reason it doesn't have that recognition is because it was decades ahead of it's time and it violated the comfortable pre-conceived notions that most people have about Law Enforcement.|"When there is someone who is really harmful to society, law enforcement is supposed to right away catch them, and put them away, and from that point on that harmful person can no longer do any harm, they have been defeated forever. Law Enforcement are supposed to think of every variable and never have any oversights, and be immune from spies/leakers. 

&#x200B;

\- Osama bin Laden was on the run for nearly a decade after he had Flight 77, Flight 93, Flight 11, and United 175 used as weapons in one of the most powerful Nations on Earth.

\- Israel Keyes was a prolific Serial Murderer who was only recognized and identified as such when he killed someone in his literal hometown, something which he had never done before.

\- ""Siege"" by James Mason has directly created numerous Neo-Nazi Terrorist groups which are active in the United States right at this very second. Groups that are still recruiting and growing.

\- Ian Watkins was reported multiple times to U.K. police for being a child molester, with the first report being made 4 years before he actually started being investigated.

&#x200B;

(In general), Police/Law Enforcement are not perfect. Neither are they fucking clueless idiots. They try the best they can. Sometimes it results in that person in a jail-cell. Other times, the person they're hunting dies of old age after years of living in relative peace.  You clearly see on The Following that the adversaries spend most of their time as free-men because they:

\-Use burner phones for communicating with members of their group

\-Purchase properties through dozens of shell corps 

\-Use Fake IDs

\-Wear things like dark-tinted sunglasses and hats to try to obfuscate their faces

\-Manipulate members of an institution to your will so that you can use them to infiltrate that organization 

\-Place spies in positions where they would right away be able to spot a incoming threat to their boss upstairs

&#x200B;

Law Enforcement in The Following is heavily hindered by such things, but still makes heavy progress, such as discovering ""Sam Lewis"" is not the man's actual name, finding out the location of Daniel Monroe (who religiously lived off the grid), tracking down a Safehouse used by the Killer Twins, ect, ect. 

&#x200B;

There are Terrorists/Serial Killers/Child Predators/War Criminals/ect. out there freely engaging in their crimes at this exact moment, this is a clear fact. But it being reality doesn't somehow make it less un-nerving.

&#x200B;

I could rant on and on about other shit, like how the creators of this show (accidentally?) predicted a lot of future trends in relation to Terrorism, The Following's un-recognized use of analogies/metaphors, the Following's portrayal of the thought processes of extremists/sadists, ect ect. However, if there's one thing I want you to take away from my preaching, it is this: I think you would like The Following if you like The Wire/BB/Sopranos/ect. I think that it's got the same level of character complexity, memorable scenes, attention-grabbing protagonists, elements you can tell they purposefully engineered for the purpose of inspiring discussion/debate among fans, ect ect."|thetrueway|False|https://redd.it/eghz1v|0|0.2|0|16|1|television

Now I understand not showing the season and episode number because first time viewers might feel apprehensive seeing it and feeling like they're jumping into it in the middle.

eg5vkp|2019-12-27 03:49:14|"Could a ""Who Shot Mr. Burns"" mystery work in a modern television series?"|"A video came up in my recommended called *[How to Solve Who Shot Mr. Burns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-eac-M1KpI)*. As I was watching how the episode was set up, and what precautions were taken to prevent the answer from being revealed, it vaguely reminded me of how movies today often use multiple reshoots to prevent spoilers. The speaker also talked about the various set ups that were used to create the conclusion they had in mind- which only piqued my interest as I drew parallels between the episode and the sequential storylines we often see in movies and television series(es?) today.

What really got my gears turning was when the speaker recalls his own experience with how people discussed the case online. I imagined that, were the episode done today, discussions would be much more prevalent if the mystery were as universal as *The Simpsons* was in the 90's. Would there be such a large buzz if, say, *The Mandalorian* created a mystery case on the level of *Who Shot Mr. Burns*? What if Disney offered a cash prize for solving the case, like Springfield's Most Wanted?

In short, would it be viable to make a *Who Shot Mr. Burns* today- whether as a marketing stunt or as a dramatic moment? What might be different? What would remain the same?"|Username1906|False|https://redd.it/eg5vkp|0|0.5|0|10|1|television
