ekdby1|2020-01-05 13:59:17|Edge of Tomorrow is such a well-made sci-fi flick and its conceit is so effectively utilized (rather than being a gimmick) but I do have a question...|"I watched Edge of Tomorrow this morning as I was getting ready for the day.

It reminded of Knives Out in that it has great 'rewatchability' and you notice new things each time.

Back when it came out I watched it a ton of times but funnily, it was only today that I understood the significance of some story beats. For example, 'Hendrix' - a person Rita knew before the events of the movie, dies 'over 300 times' and she couldn't save him. Cage looks upon Rita wistfully as she talks about Hendrix because Cage feels the same way about her.

There's lots of fun superficial things to notice on repeat viewings and then there's stuff like the Hendrix story beat which are deeper and important to the character development of Cage.

All this said, I do have a nagging question about the conceit of the film.

EACH time that Cage dies, he resets the day and lives it over. Now, **does this mean that there are splintering timelines each time he dies?** So everyone else exists in a timeline where Cage dies and then humanity eventually dies?

Interestingly, during the scene at the barn Cage tells Rita that there's a mimic '20 yards away' that will attack her when she starts up the heli. Apparently this happens all the time, **so does this mean the Omega is aware of the resetting days due to Cage?** It can learn still but can't willfully reset the day? (If that is the case, then it would be able to transmit it's knowledge to the rest of the mimic forces wouldn't it due to the hive-mind structure of the species?)"|Al-Andalusia|False|https://redd.it/ekdby1|2731|0.89|0|293|1|movies

ek9ghq|2020-01-05 06:44:11|The on-screen chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña in End of Watch (2012) is one of the best pairings of performances I have ever seen. Such a fantastic film. Cannot believe it's been 8 years since its release, and only just coming onto my radar now.|"I'm not real big into the whole buddy/cop genre, but with that being said - this film blew me away.

Gyllenhaal and Peña's relationship/bromance is so incredibly genuine and true, I'd be surprised to hear if they weren't great friends in real life. The reality of their relationship underscores the whole film.

Also credit to David Ayer for writing such a script that elicits an extraordinary dichotomy of emotions. There was both an authenticity and originality in tone to this movie that I haven't seen in cinema for a long while.

Did not expect this film to be as good as it was.

ekotjq|2020-01-06 04:30:26|What terrible/mediocre movies do you think should get remade?|"We live in age where movies that are exceptional as they are, are getting remade whereas in my opinion, should be the other way around. I think Hollywood bets on Nostalgia but I personally think they should play with older IPs that are forgotten opposed to alienating familiar audiences of beloved properties. I'd love to see a remake of:

***Stay Alive (2005)*** \- A slasher movie about teenagers playing a game which is actually haunted and they start dying one by one as their characters. I think the film was campy but the idea is rich as it is and can work really well today. Especially with VR and with more realistic CG like cutscenes today. I think this would be a huge hit not many have done much with this concept especially how massive gaming has gotten in the past decade. 

***I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)*** \- A great horror concept but incredibly cheesy execution and is a product of its time. It can be much more terrifying like the game, Until Dawn (before the twist) if done correctly. Hollywood should jump on this before the CW does a shitty TV series of it.

***The Island of Doctor Moreau (1996) -*** Nothing to be said here."|TheSonsofBatman|False|https://redd.it/ekotjq|101|0.88|0|309|1|movies
ektzj7|2020-01-06 13:13:07|"Pixar animators should make their foray into more adult films with an animated version of ""Blood Meridian"" by Cormac McCarthy"|"I'm not saying that following up that weird troll adventure flick they release an interpretation of one of the most violent books out there. I'm saying that, similar to how Disney has Touchstone, they can have a studio for more mature animated films and release this one first. Before you comment it, yes, the animated short “The Pocketwatch” which I think is by some former Pixar animators, did inspire me to write this. Think about a full length movie with that kind of budget and talent based off a text as beautifully written as “Blood Meridian”!

There were many attempts to make it into a movie already but none of them seemed to have gotten past the script-phase. I’ve heard that Vincent D’onofrio was considered for the role of the judge, and while a role like that would surely jumpstart a D’onofrissance, I think the only way to get a character like Judge Holden right would be if he was animated. The reference for this character is described by Samuel Chamberlain, who was actually in Glanton's gang that: “*He stood six foot six in his moccasins, had a large,  fleshy frame, a dull, tallow-colored face destitute of hair and all  expression, always cool and collected.”*  That really limits the number of professional actors who could reasonably play him in any live-action adaptation. He needs to be played by someone with an overbearing amount of charisma and coolness that is way beyond the archetypical 'gentle giant' and more into living demigod. You have to have an actor with a huge amount of charming eloquence and wisdom to have perhaps his most famous speech pop on screen as well as if you read it: 

“*Men are born for games. Nothing else. Every child knows that play is nobler than work. He knows too that the worth or merit of a game is not inherent in the game itself but rather in the value of that which is put at hazard. Games of chance require a wager to have meaning at all. Games of sport involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselves sufficient stake because they inhere in the worth of the principals and define them. But the trial of chance or trial of worth all games aspire to the condition of war for here that which is wagered swallows up game, player, all. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god.”*

The endless and always elegant descriptions of the landscape seems like they can only be captured by the best animators in the world. It would probably be possible to find real life locations to film that would match the almost-fantastical western setting that McCarthy invokes. I feel like it would need to have a real abstract, almost psychedelic tone to give paragraphs like this justice: 

*“That night they camped at a warm spring atop a hill amid old traces of spanish masonry and they stripped and descended like acolytes into the water while huge white leeches willowed away over the sands. When they rode out in the morning it was still dark. Lightning stood in ragged chains far to the south, silent, the staccato mountains bespoken blue and barren out of the void. Day broke upon a smoking reach of desert dark;y clouded where the riders could count five separate storms spaced upon the shores of the round earth, They were riding in pure sand and the horses labored so hugely that the men were obliged to dismount and lead them, toiling up steep eskers where the wind blew the white pumice from the crests like spume from sea swells and the sand was scalloped and fraily shaped and nothing else was there save random polished bones. They were all day among the dunes and in the evening coming down from the last low sandhills to the plain below among catclaw and crucifixion thorn they  were a parched a haggard lot man and beast. Harpy eagles flew up screaming from a dead mule and wheeled off westward into the sun as they led the horses out onto the plain.Two nights later bivouacked in a pass in the mountains they could see the distant lights of the city below them. They crouched along a shale ridge in the leeward wall of the gap while the fire sawed in the wind and they watched the lamps winking in the blue floor of the night thirty miles away. The judge crossed before them in the dark. Sparks from the fire ran down the wind. He took his seat among the scrabbled plates of shale out there and so they sat like beings from an older age watching the distant lamps dim out one by one until the city on the plain had shrunk to a small core of light that might have been a burning tree or some solitary encampment of travelers or perhaps no ponderable fire at all.”* 

The judge and the landscape are what I think makes “Blood Meridian” a modern American classic on par with something like “Moby-Dick” and unlike that 900-page book, McCarthy made his novel relatively easy to be adapted as a screenplay. Just thinking about the format of the book after reading it again made me brainstorm about how to adapt it into a good three-act screenplay. And I feel like having it in a near fantastical world that is also violently real and gritty with the judge as a literally larger-than-life figure can only be done right in a well-made animated movie."|Zebra-Pantz|False|https://redd.it/ektzj7|17|0.66|0|14|1|movies

So much depends on what individual characters can see/shoot, and the film manages to completely disrupt any attempt to actually figure out what characters are where and how they relate to each other.

It'd be great if this was somehow important to the film, like conveying the chaos of the situation, but nope.  It just genuinely fails to understand how to shoot proper coverage.

Given the size of the cast, I don't know if it was a case of needing to shoot completely out of sequence, with the bare minimum of wide/establishing shots, but goddamn is it a frustrating way to try to watch an otherwise great flick."|GaryWingHart|False|https://redd.it/ekqp6a|23|0.74|0|12|1|movies

ekff4o|2020-01-05 16:47:30|The Irishman vs. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood|"On the surface both movies seem similar to me. They are both by incredible directors who made some of my favorite movies. They both feature two of the best ensemble casts I’ve seen. They both are dramas based on real events with moments of comedy, and both endings are supposed to upend expectations. They both are somewhat slow and meandering. And they both have been hyped and praised, surely front runners for the Golden Globes and Oscars.

So why was it that I loved Once Upon a Time and would have stayed in that world another 3 hours, but was more disappointed in the Irishman than any movie I can remember?

A few thoughts. . .

1. I was lost by the de-aging in the Irishman for the first two hours. Pesci and Pacino looked fine, but De Niro never looked or moved like he was younger than 55. The grocer stomping scene was embarrassing, the fakest violence I’ve seen in a movie this lauded. Though the beginning was poorly made, I thought the last 45 minutes of the Irishman was heartbreaking.
2. The world building was so much better in Hollywood. From the drive in that Pitt lived behind to the extended TV western scene with Leo, I got to know the places and the people. In the Irishman, I had no idea where or when it was taking place most of the time, and never got interested in any characters beyond the main three (except maybe Ray Romano).
3. The jokes actually landed in Once Upon a Time. The payoff with the flamethrower in the pool had me in stitches, but when was The Irishman supposed to be funny (as many reviews and Redittors say)? When Pacino was ranting about wearing shorts to a meeting? I didn’t laugh once.
4. Pacing. You got so much character development and tension in one scene on the Manson Family ranch, while the breakdown in relations between Hoffa and the mob took several repetitive phone calls and heart to hearts and menacing stares over a half hour. In Once Upon a Time, it was crucial to know Sharon Tate’s story beforehand to build tension for the finale. Her primary character trait, innocence, was deftly shown in her trip to the movies and bookshop and a few earlier scenes. I think the same is true of Hoffa, but I felt like the tension was squandered because his stubbornness had to be emphasized again and again in so many repetitive scenes. 

I’m probably going to get downvoted to hell for this, but I wanted to share my opinion since I scrolled through hundreds of posts in the main Irishman discussion without seeing any real negative takes on the whole movie (though many others hated the grocer stomping scene).

ekg14q|2020-01-05 17:30:54|Dragged Across Concrete|"I thought I was done with the best movies of 2019, but I watched this last night and it shot right up there.

For me, it's up there with Parasite. It takes a few familiar elements like the buddy cop movie, the heist gone wrong movie, the likable human characters vs extremely ruthless killers and mixes and mashes it all up in a way that is thrilling and feels like something now.

The thing that stood out to me for this movie was the writing. I found out after director S. Craig Zahler is also a novelist. Made sense cos he moves all the chess pieces around really effectively, especially in terms of introducing back story and showing us character motivation in the first 45 minutes.

I also admire this film for feeling, like Parasite, very 2019. There's a hopelessness to the economic situation of these characters. And there are numerous references to the hysteric entertainment press (probably at least one reason why it didn't get well reviewed.).

I wish I could give this a 10/10, but there's one particular moment of character idiocy that was needed for the plot and it just annoyed me to watch. I wonder how it even made it to the final draft.

It gets taxing, especially upon rewatch, so if anyone has recommendations for more smooth-sailing movies, I appreciate it!

Hank doesn't undergo any kind of character transformation; he seems to teach Manny what it means to be ""human,"" but never learns those lessons himself, at least not in a way that makes him understand how bad his behavior is. So we spend the whole movie rooting for this character and thinking that he's developing some sense of self-awareness, only to have him turn out to be the same delusional loser he always was at the end.

A lot of modern horror films are great, but priorities seem to have shifted away from big scary monsters cutting people up, and to more character driven psychological pieces. It's a shame because 1, it loses that specific element that makes those movies stand out in people's minds and last a life time. 2, there's that fun creative aspect that comes with the creation of the monster itself. And 3, there aren't many recognizeable costumes to put on. All there are these days are zombies and pennywise the clown.

Movies are the most powerful empathy machine in all the arts. When I go to a great movie I can live somebody else's life for a while. I can walk in somebody else's shoes. I can see what it feels like to be a member of a different gender, a different race, a different economic class, to live in a different time, to have a different belief.

This is a liberalizing influence on me. It gives me a broader mind. It helps me to join my family of men and women on this planet. It helps me to identify with them, so I'm not just stuck being myself, day after day.

ekidyh|2020-01-05 20:15:15|"""Blood of heroes"": 30 years after release, a B-movie's inspiration thrives as world-wide Jugger sports"|"After thirty years, [""Blood of Heroes"" (""Salute of the Jugger""), starring Rutger Hauer and Joan Chen,](https://youtu.be/7LyRFmzNLgE) is thriving -- as a world-wirde, real-life, full-contact sport. And this although it was widely received as a Hollywood B-movie, [with only one star at Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_of_heroes).

Sticking dog skulls on a stake while your team mates crush the opponents with chain-wrapped maces might not sound like the stuff Oscar movies are made of. But this movie managed something only few achieve, maybe because it did one essential thing -- which might have been, in turn, a core reason that it received such bad reviews.

*""Blood of Heroes""* focuses on the one and only real topic of the film: The brutal sports of Jugger. While it is staged in a post-apocalyptic setting, almost nothing is known about the historical background, why Earth has been destroyed, or how the communities work. There are no of the today oh-so popular background information packages delivered, just very scarce pieces are dropped here an there. 

The whole scenery, and story, revolves around that strange Jugger thing, which the screenwriter and director -- who only this time acted as a director himself, but has an extensive biography in screenwriting, even for films like Blade Runner or Unforgiven -- invented specifically for this movie. 

While this led to rather shallow waters in terms of classical tic-them-off film topics like romance, politics and society, it let Jugger shine.

And maybe this is why the Jugger movie managed, some years after it's release, to fascinate two independent bunches of Germans so much that they made a real-world sports out of it. No more bone-breaking, sure, but speed and an unparalleled community spirit, while being a fully working competitive sports, yes indeed.

And while Quidditch has a millions-book-selling wonder and a bunch of Blockbusters behind it, Blood of Heroes arguably managed the birth of a new sports with minimal attention.

ek9kiu|2020-01-05 06:56:34|What's the best Nicolas Cage performance?|"The more movies of his I see, the more convinced I become that he's one of my favorite actors. Whether it's one of his over-the-top performances or subtle ones, he always leaves a big mark. Just recently I saw the solid war satire Lord Of War. His portrayal of a sociopathic gun dealer feels chillingly true-to-life. His speech in the interrogation room is fantastic.

If you want all whacked-out Cage, you can't do better than Face/Off. Both he and John Travolta give some of their career-best performances in that movie. I'd also recommend Honeymoon In Vegas, a surprisingly adorable movie when you get down to it. Besides Cage it's also filled with memorable turns by Sarah Jessica Parker, James Caan and Pat Morita.

His Texas accented characters in Wild At Heart and Con Air are really memorable as well.

But my favorite of all will probably always be Leaving Las Vegas. The tragedy of chronic alcoholism feels so genuine you forget you're watching an actor, you get flashes of people who go through this every day in real life. This is as ugly and saddening as it gets.

In terms of more recent vehicles, Mandy is really good. It has a style completely its own, not just in terms of revenge flicks, but films in general. Cage is sublime as the rage-filled and emotionally wounded Red Miller."|mattiasflgrtll6|False|https://redd.it/ek9kiu|68|0.8|0|139|1|movies

ekkvoj|2020-01-05 23:23:04|Looking for Movies on Historical subjects/figures|"I love history but have watched very few movies based on historical events because they all seem to be very dramatic and heavy on made-up action/romance thats not usually very accurate 9especially roman/ancient history- if there are any gems let me know, but they look more action-based than history usually). I've seen an embarassingly small amount of movies, and I really want to start watching more, especially with history as a main focus. I'm excited for 1917, so hopefully that release + some suggestions from here can give me a good start. Again, I've watched very few movies so everything is welcomed bc its likely I haven't seen it.

What I'm looking for is ideally something non-fiction and historically accurate, rather than fictional characters in a historical setting (though I don't mind as much movies based off historical books, like Pride and Prejudice). I really like biographical stuff/ studies of an individual or group; war movies are alright but not my favorite subject, especially since a lot of my own research has been focused on daily life and I have more interest in biographic stuff.  My current favorite miniseries/shows are Versailles and John Adams HBO, so any movies like them would be great (more focused on one individual, earlier (1800 and prior) history). I'm not too opposed to ""boring"" movies, I actually liked a lot of the low-action pbs programs we used to watch in school so i'm okay with less action.

On my list to watch so far (please let me know if they're good/fitting): Lincoln, Amadeus, Lawrence of Arabia, Dunkirk

Side note, major points to anything comedic thats not a parody movie (though if it's really good feel free to recommend). I feel like history is hilarious and always lament that I haven't found a comedy series about like the romans or renaissance artists outside of like drunk history or british childrens tv shows."|18louises|False|https://redd.it/ekkvoj|0|0.5|0|16|1|movies

ekjeru|2020-01-05 21:36:37|Dragged Across Concrete has some of the most unlikeable villains ever?|"--> **spoilers** <--

Some villains you enjoy to see on screen because the acting is good or whatever but these guys are just... you hate to see them. You simply always hate to see them. Racism, misogyny, misanthropy, murder... seems like there's no line they won't cross. It's almost childish how much Zahler wants his movie to showcase this kind of shit, like a kid writing a swear word on the chalk board in grade school. ""How extreme can we get?!"" I think other reviews have called him out for this, right? 

But he probably deserves more credit than that because he's basically making a modern noir, or a Peckinpah movie, and he's committing really carefully to the idea of a seedy world. 

The counting by the villains was another effective (yet super annoying) way to make them terrifying and detestable. 

I read that Zahler said if we remember his movies then he's done a good job? Kind of dubious logic but I'm probably misinterpreting him. But mission accomplished, I guess, because I can't forget this movie.

Jennifer Carpenter is an acting god in this movie but so are most of the main actors (and I'm usually not a huge fan of Vince Vaughn's acting). 

It's also fascinating to see Mel Gibson so calm as a cucumber because in interviews he's always so physically fidgety and uncomfortable. 

I respect a lot of things about the craft of the movie and it at least earns its right to being called ""different"" because in terms of the story and the visuals, it just seems (on the whole) really out there. I also think Tory Kittles, Gibson, and  Carpenter deserve Oscar recognition... but I doubt it'll happen."|weird_filet_o_fishes|False|https://redd.it/ekjeru|1|0.48|0|15|1|movies

eklyql|2020-01-06 00:42:35|An ode to the unknown Gregory Hoblit|"In 1995, Gregory Hoblit, an award-winning television director for shows like NYPD Blue, was given the greenlight to direct an adaptation of a small novel called **Primal Fear** by fellow NYPD Blue writer Ann Biderman. It was a critical hit and after 10 years in television work, Hoblit fungal broke into feature films.   
    From the success of Primal Fear, Hoblit went on to direct a few more memorable films of the late 90's including **Fallen**, **Frequency**, **Hart's War** and **Fracture**, which was released 10 years after Primal Fear in 2007. Personality, I remember enjoying all of these movies. They were not masterpieces, but they were well-written and self-directed. His next film was a bust: **Untraceable** starring Diane Lane and Colin Hanks. I didn't even know this movie existed.There was news that he was slated to helm others such as a movie called, The Good Samaritan and Robbing The Grave (written by Stranger Things co-creator Karl Fajdusek) but they never came to be. And so with this misstep, he returned for a couple of miscellaneous tv episodes and has returned to obscurity.  
    There have been hundreds of these middle-of-the-road directors that I can only imagine see three film industry as more of a blue collar job rather than the dream of bad, forgettable directors and those famous directors who recieve all the accolades.

This summer I picked up the Criterion bluray but had not got around to re-watching it yet. My sister is visiting from out of town and wanted to watch a movie last night so I suggested Brief Encounter, as I know she likes romcoms and just romance movies in general (and I wanted to see it again). And it was a good choice! She was crying as it ended and said it may be her new favorite movie and thanked me for introducing her to it.

I really do not want to spoil anything about this movie but its a very simple story - a married woman has a  \*brief encounter\* with a married man. It starts at the end and then their rendezvous is narrated by her in flashback as she recounts their relationship; from meeting and falling in love to the guilt and shame she feels from lying to her family.

Celia Johnson is the lead and she gives an incredible performance. I was mesmerized by her eyes! She has maybe the most expressive eyes that I have ever seen; you can literally feel everything she is feeling just by staring at them. Her narration is edited in so perfectly to what she's doing on screen and really full of emotion. 

I will not give anything away but I think this movie has my favorite scene of all time. Later on in the movie there's a scene that's a previous scene from a different perspective and it is absolutely brilliant. It blew me away the first time I saw it and it blew me away again last night; its really powerful and lands so perfectly.

ek8yv0|2020-01-05 05:54:35|I fell in love with Marriage Story|"Title: Marriage Story (2019) // Review: Wow, that was extraordinary. A movie hasn’t made me almost cry in years, but this film broke my heart. This may be my most favorite movie of 2019. 

Let me get this out of the way and say the acting is impeccable. Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson do brilliantly in their respective roles. It all felt so real and intense. This is some of the best acting I have ever seen in my honest opinion. The way they deliver the emotions and mannerisms of these characters is just flawless. There are two scenes in particular that just made me tear up: the argument scene and the end scene with Adam Driver reading the note from Scarlet Johansson. Driver and Johansson are able to portray such visceral emotions in realistic and eloquent ways. I was able to fully empathize with both and understand where they were both coming from. As a character piece, this movie exponentially delivers in spades. 

Besides the incredible characters, there are other amazing elements. The cinematography, while not big and spectacular, is quite beautiful and masterful. The long shots are gorgeous and reminiscent of old movies. Throughout my viewing, I noticed that this film feels modern, yet, also feels old. It’s very interesting, and I love how it was made. Moving on, the story is personal and grounded. It simply tells the story of a divorce and all the proceedings and problems that come with that. With only this, it’s able to create a film that can make anyone cry. I mean, I was fully enthralled from the first minute of the movie. 

Now, here’s the part where I have to think of the issues of the film. I honestly can’t think of anything substantial. It maybe drags a little in the middle, and it doesn’t have the rewatchability that some films have (in my opinion). But that’s honestly all that I can think of. 

Marriage Story is an intensely personal, but quiet, story that legitimately pulled at my heart. I can’t say enough how much I adored this movie. I, of course, would recommend to anyone who just likes movies and a good story (you can find it on Netflix).

ekcttb|2020-01-05 13:10:59|in casino (1995) what criminal activities does Nicky Santoro engage in?|"hey guys, thanks for taking a look, i have been re watching the old martin Scorsese film ""casino"" and i'm particularly fascinated by the criminal activities of Nicky Santoro, the problem is, is that some of the things that nicky describes himself doing, he uses alot of slang and mob talk which i personally don't understand. so i'm going to be laying out what I THINK the criminal activities of Nicky Santoro is. 

 

the first thing i noticed is the scene where nicky says ""for the first time in my life, i found a way not to lose"" and apparently this is where nicky bets with bookmakers, and if he wins he (collects) or gets his money that he won gambling and if he doesn't win, or (laying) he takes his money back by force from the bookies, so he first crime is strong arm robbery.  



the next criminal activity is I THINK loan sharking, ""To begin, I put money out on the streets, charging' three points a week. You know, juice to the fucking dealers"" and so what i think he is talking about is that he opened an illegal money loan operation and targeted drug addicts and gambling addicts as well as dealers in the Tangiers casino, and that ""3 points a week"" means interest to their loans, 


the next thing he did was ""busting out high stakes poker players"" meaning that him and a team of men colluding with, would target high stakes poker players to coordinate and gain an unfair advantage over other high stakes power players, 



after nicky was put in the black book, he opened a restaurant and a jewelry store as a front for a burglary crew he led, that and combined with tipsters all over town he started a burglary crime wave through las vegas, 


the next crime nicky commits in the film is torture and murder, with the irishman


the next crime nicky commits is assembling an assault and intimidation crew to rough up the Lester guy, 
the next is when he kills the woman who sued the green guy, 


then after that nicky starts wacking people, about 24 murders, including a mans head in the desert, killing ""stool pigeons"" AKA police informants, killing people who didn't pay their ""shylocks"" aka loan sharks aka criminal money lenders 


and finally, the bombing against sam, 

so in order, 

1: strong arm robbery
2: loan sharking
3: cheating at poker via team collusion 
4: burglary 
5: torture and murder
6: assault, battery intimidation
7: lots of murders to plug up informants and deadbeats
8: car bombing against sam

eklhsi|2020-01-06 00:08:04|New awards season, Same issue|"Another awards season arrives, and unsurprisingly, little attention is given to horror. In 2017,  comedian Jordan Peele’s breakout hit “Get Out” received well deserved praise from both audience and critics, with the comedian-to-director even earning an Oscar for best Original Screenplay.  This may be due to the films overlaying message of race in today’s social climate, which certainly contributed to the films popularity. Nonetheless, “Get Out” was still an eery horror story with the message of how African-Americans are viewed by those belonging to a higher social class. 
       

Two years later, many anticipated Peele’s second horror film, “Us”, and what issue In today’s society Peele would convey. The horror flick followed a family on vacation that is quickly interrupted by the arrival of the family’s doppelgängers. And again, Peele demonstrates his talent and understanding in dark, humorous horror. The message concealed within the film touches on a broader issue, that of representation of the oppressed homeless population in America, even poking fun at Ken Kragen’s Hands Across America, a social event that attempted to raise awareness of homelessness in America. While often compared to his previous film, many were fulfilled with the movie, with commends especially going to Lupito Nyong’o portrayal of not only the protagonist but also in the opposite role of the crackled-voiced antagonist. The film often brings up the fact that those oppressed both economically and socially are often over looked by those in a higher status in society.  Ironically enough, the film has received little attention from both the awards academy and mainstream audiences, reflecting the very real life problem brought up throughout the movie. 
            

The same problem found in Jordan Peele’s young horror film catalog can be found in horror director Ari Asters. One year after Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” was released, Ari Aster crept up on audiences with “Hereditary”, which examined how a bloodline contaminated with mental illness can affect a family’s traumatic experience with an element of supernatural. While the director of the socially verbal “Get Out” came from mainstream critically acclaimed work in comedy, Aster came from a much more subtle line of work in abstract horror. Ari Aster made shorts like “ The strange thing about the Johnsons”, which touched on the very taboo subject of sexual abuse in a rarely (if ever) talked about sense. Other stories, like “Munchausen” portrayed how a mothers love can sometimes go too far. In 2018, “Hereditary” slowly burned audiences with an   distressingly dark story that had a climax that gave a feeling of both watching a guillotine and being in one at the same time. While the story received some praise, it was lead actress Toni Collete’s damaged performance that received not only praise but also call for an Oscar nomination. And of course, no attention was given to the film. 
           

2019 Ari Aster came back with Midsommar, which again received little attention. While it may not have been as simplified horror as his prior release, the film still centered around a female led portrayal of family loss acted by Florence Phugh. Both films are led by a character that has to deal with the sudden aftermath of deprivation of a loved one, and both are portrayed by actresses who give a gut wrenching performance that demonstrates true human loss. 
        

Both Jordan Peele and Ari Aster have released horror films that are much more than the general jump-scare-by-ghost that audience seem to want to see, with themes of oppression and loss. One out of four of the films released by the two fresh directors have received well earned praise, with the other three being passed on by the all-knowing academy.

I love how the original volumes are cut and wouldn’t ever want those changed, but me being an editor I couldn’t help but wonder what this might look like in chronological order, so I searched all over the internet and found nothing.

I haven’t seen him in his pre-Superman stuff, so I can’t say anything about that but the stuff I have seen him in, I think he acted pretty good but his characters felt like they were limiting him. I also think he was really good in The Witcher but the grunting and hmm were too much (maybe that’s more of a script problem).

The films also star Matt Smith, Matthew Goode, Adam Bakri, Indira Varma, and Ralph Fiennes.

What is curious is in spite of the star-studded cast,  good critical reception and true story of a brave woman who risked everything to protect her country from lies, the movie seem to be getting no mainstream attention and also had no marketing at all.

Keira Knightly is great in the movie and the movie seems more relevant now as Trump is trying to rally America for another war.

ejy1cr|2020-01-04 15:37:21|The Lighthouse: A simple explanation (SPOILERS)|"SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

Everywhere I've read the most complex and overly-thinked theories about what The Lighthouse was all about.

Let me tell you right away it's not about a descent into madness, a symbolic analysis on religion or a psychological representation of human society.

The key to understand this movie is the same as in movies like Mullholland Drive (2001) or Stay (2005), to name some. Everything we see, except the very final scene, is a feverish dream, a comatose or agonizing representation of reality by a dying mind.

You see, Ephraim (Thomas Howard), played by Robert Pattinson, never made it to the lighthouse. After an horrific and tragic shipwreck, his badly injured body washed ashore, only to be eaten by seagulls.

Everything we see up to that final scene is in Thomas's delirious, dying mind and can be separated into 3 main categories:

**1- Things he actually experienced in the past.**

**2- Things he dreamed of, or fantasized in the past.**

**3- Things that are happening to him in his final moments**

&#x200B;

Let's dissect these categories a bit: 

**1- Things he actually experienced in the past.**

\- Thomas worked for a long time in Canada in the timber industry

\- He had a lot of discipline problems, mostly related to his alcoholism, his sexual deviations (uncontrollably masturbating), his problems with authority figures, and his overall psychological instability. 

\- The ""captain's log"" he found floating in the water is actually a manager's log he found back in his timber years and describes exactly the kind of issues he presented back in those years.

\- He did found a mermaid figurine, probably carved into a piece of wood by a partner in a timber station

\- He saw one of his working partner (Ephraim Winslow) drown under the floating wood logs and did nothing to save him. Instead he took advantage of the situation and took the deceased partner's identity to get himself a fresh, clean start. But as we see later this really messed his consciousness and the guilt only got worse and worse.

\- He read lots of sea related stories

\- He heard about the life in lighthouses and thought it would be his best bet. He managed to embark into a ship destined to a lighthouse, but the ship was struck by a nasty storm and sunk.

&#x200B;

**2- Things he dreamed of, or fantasized in the past.**

\- He did read a lot of sea related stories, like Moby Dick, and created himself an stylized idea of the life at sea and Ahab-like seawolves. Also the mermaid figurine ignited his sexual fantasies

\- Thomas Wake is a representation of his subconsciousness, the voice deep within telling him what he already knows but never accepted (his deviations, madness, weaknesses). He is also the guilt for letting a man die. The name Thomas wake is only revealed near the end, his mind is telling himself to wake up.

Molded after Captain Ahab from Moby Dick and such characters, he represents every authority figure with which Ephraim had issues in the past. All the curses, the stories and knowledge Wake throws at him are quotes from these readings that made an impression on Ephraim's mind.

&#x200B;

**3- Things that are happening to him in his final moments**

\-The lighthouse is nothing more than the sunlight blasting him from above, probably intermittent from occasional clouds. He doesn't understand this but can feel it as a constant force over him and that's why he tries to figure it out so desperately. In the end the sunlight wakes him up: the unbearable shine ""throws him down the stairs"" into a final glimpse of consciousness.

\- He is somehow partially aware of the seagulls over him and his inability to push them apart so he dreams about this stubborn seagull who just stands there picking his clothes and screaming at him. He hates them so much because he deeply understand what they are doing to him.

\- Near the end as he is slowly waking up, everything is falling apart around him and there's water everywhere because he is now more aware of his actual situation: his body is completely broken lying in the rocks as the tides rises over him

\- The smell he criticizes on Wake (smell of piss, shit and some more) is actually the smell coming out of his own torn guts 

\- Seagulls also picked his eyes, that's probably why we see everything in black and white

&#x200B;

Ok that's the first draft of my interpretation after watching the movie only once, I will probably edit this because I intend to watch it again, and your comments will surely make me see things I missed

This movie is amazing, and left quite an impression in me. It's one of the most intense experiences I ever got from a movie and I felt like hypnotized every second of it.

Just like JoJo Rabbit, it's a tragicomedy set in the Nazi period, the movie tells the story of a Czech couple hiding a Jew fugitive, but their pro Nazi co-worker keeps getting near the truth, which forced them to take a risky solution.

It's about 3 guys who have the same goal: Be the best birder in the world. This is done through a contest called a ""Big Year"", where a challenge is held to see who can document the most birds in a single calendar year. Most people do this in their region or state. But these guys are crazy and dedicated enough to take the challenge across their entire country. Talk about passion!

The contest is the same for everybody, **however**, the position each of these people are at in their lives is vastly different. The struggles, obstacles, highs and lows vary for each of them throughout the film. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, but it's very heartwarming and incredibly fun to watch. Oh, and that soundtrack! Very beautiful. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JClAtPb-LKk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JClAtPb-LKk))

Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin knock it out of the park and their respective characters learn a lot along the way. Their journeys are all much different but they all have the same goal in mind: Being the very best at something.

At the very least, thank you for reading this whoever you are.

*""Only he knows the price he has paid to be the best birder in the world.""*

ek8pu9|2020-01-05 05:30:40|Question about the opening sequence of Zodiac (2007)|"I’ve seen this movie a few times, and every time I watch it, I am perplexed by the opening sequence to the point where I honestly don’t know what the hell is going on...

So the film starts and this boy character who looks like a teenager but also doesn’t walks up to the car, and is NOT in a good mood. He gets in and asks the girl driving who looks older but has braces (??) if he can drive and she says no. Ok, she’s in the driver’s seat (literally), that’s cool but we don’t know why the hostility and much else about these two... Then she says she hasn’t eaten in 24 hours, which is definitely a joke but who cares, moving along...

Next they drive to a drive in diner. and despite the girl saying she was hungry just the scene before, she now says “it’s too crowded” and they leave (??). Ok... Not really weird but why the 24 hour line?

They pull up to a remote spot and this is where it gets weird. It honestly throws me through a loop, I don’t get the intention. So they park the car and almost immediately the dude says to the girl you’re acting really weird, despite the fact she’s only parking the car (??), and clearly wants to make out with this dude. Ok... Maybe it’s subverting expectations, the girl is the one pushing the envelope, except, WHY THE HELL IS IN THE DUDE IN THIS CAR IF NOT TO MAKE OUT WITH THIS CHICK? In fact, WHY IS THIS DUDE IN THE CAR AT ALL? WHERE WERE THEY GOING? WHAT IS THE DYNAMIC?

Next, the dude yells “FUCK OFF AND DIE” to a group of firecracker throwing guys, which is ok, but it compounds the confusion about HOW OLD THESE TWO ARE???? Are they 15? 25? In other words, when he yells “FUCK OFF AND DIE,” none of my questions have been answered and now im stuck analyzing those words as if it will offer insight on this character, and all I get is more confusion... All i get is that he’s a VERY angry man-child who doesn’t want to be near this girl or those dudes... Ok...

I wasn’t even sure of that, though, as I heard that audiences overall were split and had kind of a you either love it or hate it attitude. I was prepared for that though. My brother then ended up seeing the trailer and when I asked him if he wanted to see it, he said yes. Finally, after finding out that we were going, my mom asked to see the trailer. She likes Adam Sandler but I figured she wouldn’t like it since it’s so different from his normal stuff. To my surprise, however, she said it at least looked okay and wanted to go with us. So, that’s how it came about. I’m very curious who’ll like it and who won’t. Maybe some of you can help me. For those of you who have seen it, without giving away spoilers, is the trailer and marketing accurate to the movie overall? If it is, I’m thinking the family will at least be okay with it. Anything else I should know?

UPDATE: Saw it a few hours ago. Overall, it went quite well, better than I expected. 3 out of the 4 of us liked it. My brother is the only one who wasn’t really a fan. My mom was the one I was most curious about, and while she said it isn’t the type of movie she generally likes, she thought it was decent. She was very surprised by the ending. My dad enjoyed it as well but was taken aback by the breakneck pace. I liked it the most out of all of us. I really did find myself pulling for the guy despite how much of a hole he keeps digging for himself. Great performances across the board and the soundtrack was very good as well. I hadn’t seen any of the Safdies’ movies before, but I watched Good Time today to try and get a handle on their style. I liked both but I think I prefer this.

Re branding godzilla as not a force of nature, but a walking embodiment of human failure. It feels like if the 1954 masterpiece was released in the modern day. The effects drift between amazing and just okay. (but that is to be expected of toho) 

The characters all have interesting perspectives on the situation. They're far less bland than a fair amount of godzilla characters. The soundtrack (IMO) is amazing. The plot is rather mature for a kaiju film, making clear the political ramifications of a giant monster showing up.

ekbg1m|2020-01-05 10:35:29|Did 'A Quiet Place' rip off 'Primeval'?|"With the trailer for 'A Quiet Place Part 2' out I thought it would be fun to talk about this seeing how all I can find related to this is a post on themoviedb.com with two really short comments. 

Please don't get mad if you do enjoy either the film or show I'm talking about, this is more meant as a fun discussion.

So let's start off with Primeval seeing how this one is the lesser-known of the two. Primeval was a 2000's show about scientists who discover gateways that lead to both the past and future. The show has plenty to enjoy for paleontology fans but we aren't here to talk about the prehistoric creatures in the show. In episode 6 of the first season the crew encounters, for the first time, one of these portals to the future which brings to the present a creature which is referred to as ""Future predator"", yeah I know very original. The future predator is an evolved species of bat that has become hyper-aggressive. They are completely blind and see using sound. There are differences to how the creature from Primeval and A Quiet Place see, the future predator is still able to get a perspective of its environment using echolocation much unlike the creatures from A Quiet Place who seem to exclusively sense through sound. 

The blind creature that has super hearing is not where the similarities end with these two. One only has to look at the designs to see how close they look to one another. 
Creature from A Quiet Place: https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Monsters_%28A_Quiet_Place%29?file=Dontmakeasound.png 
Future predator:
https://primevalinformation101.fandom.com/wiki/Future_Predator?file=Episode5.6_8.jpg
Sure they may not look exactly the same but accounting for all the similarities one has to at least wonder if the future predator inspired the creatures from A Quiet Place."|SardonicTato|False|https://redd.it/ekbg1m|0|0.38|0|4|1|movies

ek9xdi|2020-01-05 07:36:28|"My Thoughts On ""Whisper Of The Heart"" (1995)"|"This is definitely my 2nd favorite Ghibli film and this is a movie that for me, fixes a lot of my problems that I have with Hayao Miyazaki's movies. Usually, when I am watching a Ghibli film, I feel like I actually do not know who the characters are. They are at best just figures to push the story forward and when it is done this way, I just feel very disconnected from the whole experience. I feel like I do not know anyone or that I had connected to anything. I mostly just experience nice-looking images. But with this film, I felt that I knew the female protagonist. She was an actually relatable character unlike most of the blank slate characters in Ghibli films. She feels like a real person, goes through an actual character arc, we are observing her grow internally and subtly and through subtle storytelling, we get to know both her and her relationship with others. When it comes to story and characters, I think this film does it the best because this film focuses more on those aspects when the other films focus on creating a nice-looking fantasy world and cool creature designs. And while that's nice and all, it's hard for me to connect with something if I do not care about the character or story. Although, what it does focus on story and character more than anything else, it still has very beautiful animation and does a pretty great at using setting in order for you to relate to the experience and also better help you empathize with the characters as you are seeing something familiar. Something that exists in your home. Seeing the Shijo's messy room with all the books and papers says a lot about her dedication to become without blatantly having to tell us a lot about her dedication to become a writer but also that she is someone who is imperfect and leaves those around because those are things she will keep on doing all the time and that it is pretty much her environment and she will keep it messy that way. And of course, that we people do have messes in our room to some extent. This may be a lot for simply the look of a room but a lot can be said from just the setting of somebody's territory. I also really love the use of real images to blend of drawn images. It does not only look great but it makes it feel more closer to my reality.

Another thing I love about ""Whisper Of The Heart"" is that it subverts the myth that art comes from the pain of the author. Such things as going through depression does not actually make you a ""genius"". At best, it's just an obstacle to overcome in order to create good art and at worst, it just stops you from making the art in the first place. ""Whisper Of The Heart"" shows a accurate microcosm of how great art comes to exist, which is through a balance of life experiences, hard work and education. Simply being sad and suffering from panic attacks won't help you achieve art. Another thing I love about is how it also shows how sometimes, we have to learn to take criticism and feedback in order to become better in your work. Also, that you shouldn't worry much on your work being perfect at first because we will always start out making some mistakes and overtime, we become better and better. We just have to try. We cannot let our negativity overcome us. The film also shows a scene which I found very relatable onw which her parents talk to her about in the future that she will need to work and that she should get a ""real job"", which is exactly what happened with my mother when I dreamed of becoming good in my writing and becoming a good writer. To be able to do something I can proud about and which I could live with. Another thing that resonated with me is how the film shows the female protagonist's envy for the talent of the Seiji. Don't you sometimes just feel annoyed and so inferior that somebody has great talent and you haven't reached just yet? That the person is simply was just born better than you and there is no hoping of getting up there like him/her? When I see someone write and draw or just do something better than me, these feelings and thoughts go through my head and I really how the film shows that these kind of people aren't just born geniuses. They do work for it and do take their time. You can achieve it if you try and it is not impossible for you to reach that level and to become even better.

For a film that has rather the most mundane premise out of all of the Ghibli films I've had seen, this movie engaged more than Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away.

I love this film and it is one of those films which I would rarely considered to be ""underappreciated"" compared to other films. This is so far my 2nd Ghiblin film of all time and right behind ""Grave Of The Fireflies""."|Gattsu2000|False|https://redd.it/ek9xdi|0|0.43|0|1|1|movies

One of these films, which has become the recipient of well-earned acclaim, is Bong-Joon Ho’s Parasite. Naturally this film made me more interested in watching some of his previous releases, as I had been unfamiliar with his previous work. While Netflix and Amazon Prime do have access to some of his features, Memories of Murder is currently unavailable, not even even to rent/purchase.

This lead into me asking the broader question of how film nerds check out older films when they aren’t on Amazon Prime or Netflix. Do you use some other form of digital service, or do you go out of your way to purchase physical copies?

ejwgww|2020-01-04 13:10:50|The Lighthouse interpretetions|"So currently I have several theories about what might have ""really"" happened in the film.

1. Thomas Wake was an evil, sadistic man, who saw a man haunted by guilt, and instead of being kind to him, took advantage of his weakness, manipulated and abused him further until he completely lost his mind.
2. Thomas Howard was bat shit crazy from the get go. He was a bit more stable at first, but as time goes on he really loses it. We cannot rely on anything we hear Thomas Wake say as truth, because we view the events from Howards perspective, and it is a mad man's perspective and therefore exagerated at best. By this interpretetion, Wake was an ok guy. A bit rough perhaps but not an evil man. Every time we see Wake being evil or crazy or prophetic, It is all in fact happening in Howards mind.
3. The island is Thomas Howard's personal pergatory, which he was sentenced to for letting Ephrim Winslow die, or perhaps even killing him himself. In this version Thomas Wake is his own personal devil, there to torment him for his sin. It is only when he kills Wake, that he finally acknoledges what he really is. A killer. He then goes to the lighthouse to get his salvation, which is probably denied of him, and he is sentenced to have his guts eaten by the sea gulls as a final penance, before he is allowed release and perhaps eventually salvation.
4. Wake is indeed just a figment of Howard's mind. The denial part of his subconcious, attempting to distract him from what he has done with hard work and alcohol, yet the truth is trying to come out in Howards visions. That would explain why Wake doesn't want to hear Howard's confession. In this version of events, the lighthouse simbolizes awakening. It is only after he kills the menifastation of his denial, that he is able to awaken and fully see what he has done, and punish himself accordingly.

ejy9n6|2020-01-04 15:56:14|Anyone remembers an evil rat/squirrel movie?|"I've watched this film when I was just 7, I think, and I don't really remember much about it now. It's a horror movie, and the villains were these evil rats/squirrels that eats the people. 



Even as I kid, I thought it was stupid. But there is this scene that I will never forget, one that carved this film in my mind: I think it's right after a sex scene and the girl laid naked on the floor over some blankets, sheets over her body, when suddenly one of the rat/squirrel creatures slips under the covers and then goes inside her vagina. The critter started eating her from inside and then comes out of her mouth. Or perhaps her stomach. I don't really remember. But she was dead. 



Anyone knows what movie is this? Or at least has some ideas what it might be? 



Every answer will be appreciated. Thanks!"|KluxKluxSpy|False|https://redd.it/ejy9n6|5|0.56|0|11|1|movies

And lo and behold, it turned out to be the only good thing about the movie (well, this and the MGM logo, which was sort of like a teaser for this sequence). Everything else stunk.

This sequence was directed by Bob Kurtz at his company, Kurtz and Friends. They also did the animated title sequence for *George of the Jungle* and animated the character of Mr. DNA in *Jurassic Park*, among other things. In addition, one of the animators who worked on this was Disney animator Eric Goldberg!

ekcayy|2020-01-05 12:15:53|I rewatched Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, and its incredibly boring|"I thought maybe I was being too hard on this movie, so I decided to rewatch it.

It was still boring as hell. There's no plot, characters act strange...there's just a whole lot of nothing going on until the end. The end was fun and the ranch scene was intense, but aside from that this movie was a whole lot of fluff. It was incredibly stale.

I found Irishman and Ad Astra to be more engaging than this movie....and those movies are by their design, slow....

I think Tarantino relied too much on nostalgia bait. He hasn't had a true masterpiece since Pulp Fiction. Fair enough it's a high bar to clear. 

I'm glad this movie won't win Best Picture. Its between Marriage Story or Irishman, either of which are superior."|throwawaysgkwm|False|https://redd.it/ekcayy|0|0.44|0|85|1|movies
ejxbk0|2020-01-04 14:35:52|Am I missing something in Blade Runner 2049?|"I just watched it last night and I was left empty and underwhelmed. But everyone says that it's a masterpiece. I don't really get it, because I see some major problems with the film.

First let me say what I liked. It looked great, the world feels faithful to the original in terms of atmosphere, but more vibrant and interesting too. The continued world-building was pretty good. Um... that's about it.

I have some problems that I haven't seen anyone else address. Hopefully someone can explain to me why they may not be problems or what I am missing, because I want to understand what is so great about this film.

My biggest problem: why does it feel like K (or Joe) has little to no character growth? He kind of has an arc from retiring the farmer in the beginning to saving Harrison Ford, but beyond that I fail to see how he changes as a character. He loses his 'girlfriend' and never reacts. He tries to figure out if his memories were real, but they were fake as he suspected. There is something thrown in at the end about choosing a side between humans and replicants, but he chooses... both? In the 'climactic' fight between K and Wallace's assistant, he just kills her with no emotional struggle and saves Harrison Ford. I understand that he is a replicant so he is to act like a robot- so does that mean he shouldn't change throughout the film? Him being a replicant makes him an uninteresting character. He didn't even develop emotions like the rogue replicants from the original.

Second, the third act is weird and overstuffed:

They bring back Deckard really late in the film so this section feels like a new story. It feels like Deckard should have been introduced very early and been a major character.  The marketing certainly made him appear to be.  Almost like they felt obliged to finally reintroduce a character we know from the original.

Also, the part with Rachel is frustrating. Why does Wallace make another Rachel? To convince Deckard to bring him to the child? (I thought Deckard didn't know where she was?) I know that Wallace wants to make replicants that can reproduce, but I feel like I am missing something important here, so my misunderstanding might by my fault. Help me to understand. But it all feels like callback for the sake of callback.

Finally,  why are major characters and plot points introduced 2 hours in? We just find out that there are other rogue replicants and one of them was involved with Deckard and Rachel's daughter. And now they want K to kill Deckard? And start a war between humans and replicants? Again, too much, too late, in too little time. This feels like it, again, should have been introduced very early on.

One more thing: is Wallace the villian? Because he is only in 2 scenes where he acts all pretentious and prophetic. He's certainly a douchebag, but is he a villian? And his assistant is a replicant with no personality, so she can't really be the antagonist, can she?

Those are my problems with Blade Runner 2049. Mostly pacing and character issues. Again, I want to understand why this film is apparantly so good, so I thought I'd ask. I've yet to see these specific complaints with the film, so it would be nice to know if I am alone in my problems or not.  Also, sorry if this film is no longer relevant.

Thanks for reading this! :)

EDIT: Sorry, I just remembered one more issue I had: Deckard's boss says he has 48 hours to get out of the city. So time is of the essence. So why does he stop to have sex with his 'girlfriend' and go to sleep? It makes his problems feel less pressing and screws with the pacing.

ek51ln|2020-01-05 00:18:20|In celebration of truly terrible movies|"I love movies in general of all shapes and sizes. I'll watch anything. However, I Have a long-standing soft spot for bad movies. 

This covers the gamut from Speed Race to The Room. Last night for example I watched VelociPastor, which is about a pastor who turns into a dinosaur when he's angry and fights criminals. It's gloriously bad. 

Sometimes you get lucky and find a hidden gem. Mega Time Squad is like this. It's very low budget, but was funny and was clearly made with love. 

Other times you get full of ridiculousness, like Turbo Kid or Hobo With a Shotgun. These are typically cartoonishly violent, and are like a normal action movie on shrooms. I love them all.

I wanna see some unusual praise here but please let's try not to down vote people for simply having a harmless opinion. 

Like... is THE 6TH DAY (2000, but close enough) a classic for some of you? 

CON AIR (1997)?

UNDER SIEGE (1992)?

ENEMY OF THE STATE (1998)?

ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (1981)?

EVENT HORIZON (1997)?

Most of those are action but that wasn't really on purpose. Many of those are respected too but I want to see people make a high level claim for the quality of a movie... are any of those **masterpiece** level (however you personally define that) to you? Or any other movie from the 80s and 90s?

I believe it was from another movie about Communist China invading Tibet or some other country. I recall the scene went like:

There's a recently occupied fortress, or a wall, or some type of building with a gate and above the gate is a picture of Mao Zedong and there are some Chinese soldiers standing guard near and around it, and you can hear the echoes of someone speaking Chinese or Tibetan through a loudspeaker. Then what I assume is the main character is walking up to the building to meet another man walking out towards him. I recall the main character was a white man and the man he was talking to was someone native to the invaded country. The main character was angry at the man, I don't know exactly why, maybe because he thought the man was somehow responsible for the occupation succeeding or that the man was a pacifist and just stood by and didn't try to fight back the Chinese, so the main character beats the man to his knees in anger while the Chinese soldiers look on apathetically, not stopping or trying to intervene.

That's at least how I remember the scene. This was over a decade ago so I might be missing some details or not remembering correctly. I think the movie came out sometime in the 90s or 00s.

And I remember thinking, ‘Why am I watching this silly film? Look at her, she’s not a babe. My God! The shoes!’ Twenty minutes later I was sitting there with tears streaming down my face and I was in love with Celia Johnson, this girl with the sensible shoes… It just occurred to me that there were other things you were seeing when you looked at the painting, and they all affect you.""*

**Michael Apted on Ingmar Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES (1957)**:

> *""It’s what I saw when I was 15, and it showed me that films could be something more than just entertainment or going and staring at girls in the cinema or whatever, but film could have the kind of weight of a book or something like that... I grew up in a suburb of London, and I went to school in the middle of London, and that’s when I found myself, one wet afternoon, in an arthouse, and there was Wild Strawberries, and that, for me, was the beginning of it all. It had so many ideas, and it played with dreams, and I thought, 'Oh my God. This is quite something.' So it really was a kind of major event in my life.""*

That’s another movie I saw in theaters with my mom when it came out in 2001 [in the US], when I would have been 15. It changed my life... He stages the most perfect vignettes, and I think he has an entire month to build every set for every scene... If Jacques Tati merged with Ingmar Bergman and then got beaten up by Gary Larson, you'd have something approximating Andersson's sensibility – but it still wouldn't be anywhere near as wonderful.""*

**Richard Ayoade on Louis Malle's ZAZIE DANS LE METRO (1960)**:

Before I saw it, films were Hollywood to me. They didn't seem made by people.

A true story — I said, 'You know, when I was 15, I worked at Lucasfilm and I filed your Raiders of the Lost Ark storyboards. I saw the entire movie and I honestly thought it was going to suck.'

I couldn't remember much detail, just the sense of the movie itself. So powerful. Watching it was an event for me, a movie event. ... What is really extraordinary about Renoir, particularly in La Règle, is that he loves all his characters. He loves the goodies and baddies, the ones who make terrible mistakes. He loves the ones who are on screen for just two minutes. This is something I have always tried to do.""*

**Kathryn Bigelow on Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH (1969)**:

> *""I saw The Wild Bunch on a double bill with Mean Streets, midnight at the Waverly Place Cinema on Bleecker Street. Those two played on a double bill; I was in New York, I had a studio and I was basically a practicing artist, working with various art groups — Art & Language, kind of conceptual arts, political arts. We were doing environments, we were doing installations, performance pieces… and I stumbled into this incredible double bill. And it was a life-changing experience. I thought they were just extraordinary. Peckinpah for his muscularity, his immediacy, his sheer genius in his storytelling and characters. I was knocked out.*

Whoever programmed those two movies together… it was at a moment when, in an art context, I was beginning to make short films. So film was definitely becoming a medium that was intriguing to me, and I hadn’t quite made a complete transition yet, but I found those two films just extraordinary, and they opened up a kind of unimaginable landscape for me. That kind of great irreverence, and intensity, and strength of purpose in those characters.""*

**Peter Bogdanovich on Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE (1941)**:

> *""It's just not like any other movie you know. It's the first modern film: fragmented, not told straight ahead, jumping around. It anticipates everything that's being done now, and which is thought to be so modern. I first saw it when I was about fifteen. And it fucking flipped me out. It was like no other movie. It still isn't -- what movie is like it?""*

**Danny Boyle on Francis Ford Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW (1979)**:

> *""It is a master film. It's my own personal favorite; if I had to nail one film on my heart, this would be the one... It just fueled my obsession with experiences in the cinema, really, of trying to create. There are risks attached to it. You're trying to stretch things, but you are also fundamentally committed to getting as many people to see it as possible. And it's that battle, those two horses that [Coppola] rode, and I don't think anybody ever rode it quite like he rode it.""*

**James Cameron on Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968)**:

> *""It was probably five days after it opened, the summer of ’68. I watched [2001] from front row center in the balcony, which put me dead in line to the Star Gate [Jupiter trip sequence], right on the axis, so I felt like I was falling down through the Star Gate... It’s not a film that I like; it’s a film that I love. When I say I don’t like it, it’s that I don’t like the feel of the film. I don’t like its sterility. I like a film with a little more emotional balls, just as a movie, to get involved in. But as a work of art, I love [2001]. It had an enormous, enormous impact on me, at a certain point.”*

**John Carpenter on Fred M. Wilcox's FORBIDDEN PLANET (1956)**:

> *""I was eight years old, 1956, and went to a move called Forbidden Planet down at the Capital Theatre down in Bowling Green. That movie changed much of my life. One of the things that it changed was my idea of what music could be and was, because it had an all-electronic score done by [husband-and-wife duo] the Barrons. To this day… I can listen to it, the score to Forbidden Planet. I'd be transported beyond time and space. It was profound to me as a kid. I think that was a turning point for me in my life for many reasons. One, it made me want to be a movie director, and two, the potential of what I heard was so different than the orchestra or piano that my father played, or the violin he played, or any conventional music. It was literally, amazingly futuristic.""*

**Sylvain Chomet on Nick Park's CREATURE COMFORTS (1989)**:

> *""Films can change your day or change your week, but it's rare that you watch something that actually changes your life, something that sends you off in a completely different direction. But that's what Creature Comforts did for me. I first saw it at the Annecy animation festival. It was 1989 and I was living in London, doing animation for advertising but just to earn my living -- I wasn't thinking of making films. It was clever, well-crafted, amazingly funny and universal: kids would enjoy it as much as adults. It also told some fundamental truths and there was a bit of sadness in it, too. So many things; it was like watching fireworks. I saw the response it got from the audience and I said to myself: 'This is what I want to do.

It was kind of a life-changing experience because I was confronted with a kind of cinema that, with all the love that I have for movies, this was something different. And it had to do with the realities and the truthfulness of the story and situation. In Mexico when lower classes were portrayed, poverty was portrayed, it was always in a melodramatic, patronizing kind of way. This was a completely different experience.""*

ej4239|2020-01-02 20:50:24|Brokeback Mountain hit me really hard after finally seeing it yesterday.|"I hope I don’t get raged on for this...but I just have to share. This movie just changed my life and adjusted my outlook. I’ve never considered myself a homophobe, and I’ve certainly never hated anyone or wished them harm because of their sexual orientation...but I was certainly more ignorant than I gave myself credit for. This movie challenged me and changed me for good. 


Brokeback Mountain came out when I was a young teenager. At the time, I laughed about it and made fun of the concept. Gay cowboy movie, hur hur hur. Buttfuck Mountain, guhhhh huh huh. I refused to watch it. I resigned myself to the crowd mentality of a 13 year old boy. 

As I grew up, I would often be the one saying “why do they have to have a parade?” or “Why be so loud just because you like men?!”  or “Pride *Month*?! You’ve gotta be kidding me.”

Parades were for holidays, not sexual orientations. I really believed that. 

But there are also parades for veterans. There are weekends where we remember people who didn’t come back from war, and there are gay men who never came back from their own *personal* war. There are gay men that are fighting that war right now...and they feel alone and vulnerable in their foxhole. 

I couldn’t put the homosexual experience into the context of a real human life, like my own. I simply could not relate. Loving people, and caring about them is part of life. Part of knowing your family is knowing how certain knowledge will hurt them, and keeping it from them to avoid the mess. Dealing with the fallout when that secret becomes public can be massively stressful and emotionally draining, and damage control can be nearly impossible. 

I have kept secrets before, but I’ve never had to look my child in the eye and know that they probably wouldn’t exist if I had been honest with myself...and the world. Layer on top of that that I probably would be putting my *life* and their lives in danger by letting the secret out....I couldn’t even imagine the stress. 

Obviously, I’m late to the game with this movie, but if you haven’t seen it yet, I’d recommend putting it at the top of your list. It’s as visually stunning as movies like The Revenant and True Grit, and as good a love story as Casablanca or The Notebook. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I’ll never use the word “faggot” again.

**Short Version:**

He loves spoilers, I hate them. We both have different ways of enjoying movies. Does anyone have similar experiences or coop tips?

&#x200B;

**Detailed Version:**

Ok, so I had a discussion with my best friend a month ago.

\- I hate spoilers that gives away any part of a movie, so that includes articles, comments, trailers, etc; I live for the adrenaline rush you get from the surprise element. When I learn of any spoiler I feel it ruins part of the movie. This doesn't make sense to my best friend.

\- He loves spoilers and knowing the surprises of a movie before it comes, so obviously likes articles, comments, trailers, etc. He says that knowing about spoilers helps him enjoy a movie more. This does not make any sense for me.

Now just 15 min ago we finished watching a movie, I had seen it before, he had not. I really wanted to watch the movie again, I thought he would like it, and because the movie it so dramatic, I was really looking forward to seeing his reaction, especially to the end of the movie.

Throughout the movie he is saying to me how he thinks *such and such* is gonna happen, then says 'I told you so when he is correct'. Also, when we got to the last 20 min of the movie, he turned to me and exclaimed 'I saw the end of the movie, it was \_\_\_\_'. I ended up finishing the movie with him, but really just pissed me off and made me angry. I don't know why this upsets me, but it does.

Now I am not making this post to change his ways or anything, I am really just venting. Just expressing my thoughts and annoyances ....

Personally, I say The Batman. I'm very excited for both (they're my most anticipated movies of 2020/2021, respectively) but Batman is something that will always excite me. 

But above all else, I'm excited for Robert Pattinson to be finally shed his reputation as ""*that guy from Twilight""* and be embraced by mainstream audiences."|mrmonster459|False|https://redd.it/ejzwev|0|0.39|0|53|1|movies

ejgsm7|2020-01-03 15:22:13|Which Are Your Favorite Exposition Scenes In Film?|"I know that a lot of people hate these and stuff but I think that in some cases, exposition can be very engaging and informative if done right. 

I for example love each of the black and white scenes in Memento. I think they are very important in order to understand how Leonard's condition works. It also has hints to Leonard's motivations and backstory. Not to mention that Guy Pearce gives a fantastic performance so is very entertaining to see how he explains things and that him acting very informative, organized and analytical makes a lot sense due to his condition as he has to be able to maintain information and needs to be able to keep things in order to adapt to this lifestyle. It doesn't feel unnatural with how it is delivered.

I also love Psycho's scene where the psychologist explains the whole backstory to Norman Bates. I think the explanation of it all is very grabbing and that the actor playing the psychologist gave a very great performance. There's a lot of passion and charm to how he informs the characters and us, the audience, about everything. Hell, it is easily one of my favorite scenes in the movie, maybe even my favorite.

ek9esu|2020-01-05 06:39:10|Why I won't be watching movies anymore.|"I won't be watching movies or T.V. anymore for the 2020's. Peak television is already here, and I think ""peak cinema"" is right behind it. The democratization of media has made the entertainment industry just that, an industry. Movies no longer seem like art; they're just products catered to specific audiences. Even the good movies recently feel like some sort of ""film buff"" genre rather than anything really noteworthy or risk-taking. 

Technology, oversharing, and drama have also overtaken filmmaking. Needlessly high frame-rates and CGI James Deans are turning movies into a precise easy craft rather than an art form that used technological limitations to its advantage, forced to make something beautiful from the struggle. Movie studios, actors, and filmmakers also share way too much information deconstructing the filmmaking process to where you are rarely absorbed in a movie and instead thinking about everything on the periphery of it. If I was in charge of making a film, I would make everyone sign an N.D.A. where they'd be sued if they discussed the movie-making process on the internet. It also seems like Hollywood thrives of mostly contrived internet drama to bait people into seeing a movie. Remember when controversial entertainment made the history books? Now it's just everyday. Boring. There's no culture in the West anymore, so stop trying to be rebellious and edgy all the time. You have no enemy."|_blacksword_|False|https://redd.it/ek9esu|0|0.11|0|25|1|movies

There are long stretches of nothing scary happening in this movie. The “scary” parts are more disturbing than they are “frightening”. And the only “scary” parts really are when Peter bangs his head in the classroom, and when the mother chases Peter in the house. Everything else is nothing but a buildup it seems.

The idea was basically that Hollywood uses this shaking camera with 80 different cuts to mask the fact that the hits and kicks aren't actually landing with any power.  

It was contrasted with kung fu movies of times past where the camera was more of an installation in the room and it would simply pan as needed, capturing the action in a full shot.

While it was great, somewhere down the line I must’ve missed the mark with the ending. 

-What happen to Doctora? I guess the TV mentioned that help was coming, but seriously, that’s all we get? 

-What was significant about the shot with Lady and the kids under the table (brother protecting his sisters)? Were we suppose to believe it was Doctora at first? Is it trying to say Lady is going to kill the kids?

-Also what was so significant about zooming in on Rambo during the plane ride (very last scene)? 

The thing that irked me was that these kids are so unorganized and reckless, but when the older “higher ups” come to them, they turn into a bunch of little rambos out of nowhere. 

Overall it was a good movie, perhaps I hyped myself up too much though."|bxncwzz|False|https://redd.it/ejpfai|6|0.59|1|4|1|movies

ejujy3|2020-01-04 09:23:25|Most overlooked Al Pacino performances|"Two Bits:

As the sick and fragile grandpa of Gennaro, Al Pacino gives one of the most heartbreaking and beautifully subtle turns in his entire career. Even though he only appeared for a few scenes, those scenes were extremely memorable. This whole movie in general is great, but Pacino is the greatest thing of all about it.

S1m0ne:

Pacino is very sympathetic and amusing in this underrated satire of enhanced technology and celebrity obsession. You really feel for Viktor Taransky looking to be validated for his work, which he attempts to acheive with his new star Simone... but in the end all they really care about is Simone, not the actual content of his movies.

Manglehorn:

Worlds can't describe how much I love Pacino in this movie. He conveys so much emotion with just a look in his eyes, and perfectly portrays the loneliness and sorrow in Manglehorn's heart. I thought this was a excellent role which proved why he's still the greatest actor alive, but it's one that never gets noticed by the general public."|mattiasflgrtll6|False|https://redd.it/ejujy3|0|0.5|0|20|1|movies
ejn58j|2020-01-03 22:44:49|Three Classic Swedish 1970s/80s Movies Worth a Watch|"These are three classic Swedish movies from the 1970s/80s – a golden era of Swedish movie making. They are perhaps not so well-known outside of Sweden but are well worth a watch if you are able to find them with subtitles – or if you have a Swedish-speaking friend who can help with translation!    

Äppelkriget (”The Apple War”) is a fantasy comedy from 1971 about a group of greedy capitalists, industrialists, politicians and bureacrats who wish to destroy the homes of people in beautiful rural Änglamark – ”Angel Grounds” (a fictionalized version of the Österlen region in Scania) – in order to build a gigantic resort with amusement parks and casinoes for wealthy tourists under the name Deutschneyland. However, a group of odd and quirky local countrypeople set out to save their homes, nature, cultural heritage and simple way of life from exploitation and destruction – with a bit of help from some creatures from Norse mythology such as elves, giants, the neck and the huldra. The film is written by Hans Alfredson and Tage Danielsson, who were a very popular comedic duo in Sweden from the 1960s to the 1980s. Danielsson is also the movie's  director (he also directed e.g. the Swedish film version of the Swedish children's novel ”Ronja the Robber's Daughter”) and has a small non-speaking part, while Alfredson has a larger role in the film as an eccentric but clever inventor. The movie is star studded from a Swedish perspective. It stars e.g. Monica Zetterlund (a very famous Swedish singer at the time), and even Max von Sydow (from ”The Exorcist” and ”The Seventh Seal”) in a small comedic part. The soundtrack of the movie is written by Evert Taube, one of Sweden's greatest poets and singer/songwriters of all time – and includes the beautiful and touching theme song Änglamark, which became somewhat of a theme song of the Swedish environmentalist movement during the 1970s. Taube himself (who was very elderly at the time) has a cameo in the movie's last scene. The film also contains a lot of beautiful imagery of Sweden's nature and countryside. The special effects are laughably bad even for the time though – but that only really adds to the charming small-budget feel. On the whole, this is a very quirky and fun little movie with a very absurdist, almost Monty Pyhtonesque feel to it. It has a lot of heart and a lovely message which is just as relevant today. It is all a whimsical love letter to Sweden's nature, and a call for its protection – without ever becoming really serious.        

Sällskapsresan (”The Companionship Trip”) is a comedy from 1980 about a shy, nerdy and extremely socially awkward middle aged man named Stig-Helmer who goes on a trip to Spain with his jolly and outgoing Norwegian friend (being jolly but slightly dumb is a common Swedish stereotype about Norwegians...). There, they meet a lot of other Swedish people also on vacation, such as a couple of women who are there primarily on hunt for men (and who of course become interested in the nerd and his friend), an oppressed middle aged mama's boy who is there with his domineering old mother, and a couple of middle aged guys who are constantly drunk through the entire trip. And of course, everyone stay put by the hotel the entire time, and become more Swedish than ever when abroad – demanding access to Swedish coffee and cripsbread, and packing Swedish flags and wooden horses in their suitcases. The humour of the movie thrives off cringe – so be prepared for a whole lot of very cringy and awkward situations. It is also very much a satire of how normally emotionally repressed and inhibited Swedes and other northern Europeans completely change personalities and lose all inhibitions when going abroad to a warmer climate and are allowed to let go of their dull, grey and serious everyday lives for a bit. There isn't really any actual plot to the movie though. This is a bit of a cult movie in Sweden, and a lot of quotes from the movie are very well-known, such as ”Is there any Swedish coffee at the hotel?”, the nerd's phrase ”I can fly, I am not afraid” in order to conquer his fear of going on an airplane, the drunkards' catchphrase ”Mind the percentage”, and the party girls' list of trip essentials being ”passport, pesetas and pregnancy prevention pills”. The movie is written and directed by Lasse Åberg, who is also famous as an artist and writer in Sweden – and he also himself plays the lead role as the awkward nerd. On the whole this is a rather fun little movie which gives a fascinating glimpse into Swedish culture and norms.          

Dunderklumpen (”The Thunder Lump”) from 1974 is a partly live action and partly animated children's fantasy movie about a troll named Dunderklumpen who on a magical Midsummer's Eve bring some toys to life so that they can help him find a treasure that he is seeking. He is however followed by the boy from the house where he stole the toys – and the boy is in turn followed by his father who sets out after his son to bring him home. It all leads to a frantic chase through the wild forests and mountains. And in the end of course everyone learns that the true treasure is not money or gold – but a child's imagination! The movie is entirely set in the stunning and dramatic wild landscape of Jämtland in northern Sweden, and the landscape itself literally plays an integral part of the story, with talking island giants and waterfalls. The voice cast consists of many of Sweden's greatest actors at the time, and throughout the movie there are a lot of catchy songs, such as e.g. ”Storm över Jorm” (”Storm over Jorm”). The movie is directed by Per Åhlin, a very famous animator in Sweden at the time. And it is written by Beppe Wolgers, who also stars as the boy's father – and in fact the boy is also played by his real life son. Beppe Wolgers was a famous Swedish writer, comedian and actor, who e.g. played the father of Pippi Longstocking in the Swedish live action version of the books, and was the Swedish voice of Disney movie characters such as Baloo and Little John. Wolgers himself lived in Jämtland, and he wrote the movie largely as a love letter to the province's beautiful and mysterious landscape. This is a charming movie not just for children, but for everyone who loves a whimsical and fantastical fairy tale adventure."|Malthesse|False|https://redd.it/ejn58j|7|0.69|0|2|1|movies

I dunno, I expect a lot of downvotes for this, and I’ve thought about the idea that Jo is still happy and successful without her guy, and about how she was lonely and went through an arc of just blindly looking down on relationships to actually appreciating the good they can do, and I’ve even thought about the fact that the book editor was a living embodiment of such issues and acts as a kind of meta-commentary on the film’s message, but none of this changes the fact that it felt contradictory to me, and that it just didn’t feel like the natural progression of things. If the film had stuck to its guns and done as Jo herself said, and had her not end up with anyone, I just would’ve liked it more.

Happy to be proven wrong, just unsure about it all."|LancasterDodd777|False|https://redd.it/ek094t|0|0.37|0|15|1|movies

It was about a group of kids that got the knowledge that someone from their village went to search for a treasure in a cave.
the group of kids then went to look for the treasure themself.
Somehow they found their way in the cave and the way to the entrance collapsed. Moving further they found the dead body of the person who was there first.
If they wanted to leave the cave they had to jump in a hole where they lit a map on fire to see how deep they had to jump. 

eventually, they left and made a grave for the guy that died.

I hope this is enough of information, I've been wondering what the title is of this movie is for a long time. I hope someone knows the title.

ek1qzq|2020-01-04 20:12:55|A Quiet Place 2 might not be as good as the first one.|"I still remember seeing A Quiet Place (part 1) trailer for the first time and being mind blown by the silent setting. The film was unique in how the sound (or lack thereof) was part of the plot. The trailer for the second part didn't have one element that surprised me in a way the first one did.

The trailer screams bigger budget which is usually not a good sign for films like quiet place. An example would be ""IT chapter 2"" which was good but pales in comparison to ""IT Chapter 1"". IT 2 relied more heavily on CGI jump scare set pieces and it ended up being not as scary as IT 1 was.

The trailer also reminded me a bunch of other movies.

* The opening car scene in the trailer jarringly reminded me of the infamous continuously shot car sequence from Children of men.
* The chaos in Cillian Murphy's flash back reminded me of opening scenes of the Bird Box film.
* I dunno why but when Cillian Murphy whispered ""The people that are left, are not the kind of people worth saving"" all I could think of was Walking Dead.

Maybe Krasinski could be trying to pull off what James Cameron did with Aliens? Follow up a sci-fi horror film with a sci-fi action sequel.

Are there others who felt let down after the trailer? If not what aspect of the trailer appealed to you?

EDIT:

BTW there was one thing in the trailer that got me excited - During the car sequence when the kid mentioned, "" That's Dad! that's Dad!"". Atleast we will get to see Jim again."|SubManian|False|https://redd.it/ek1qzq|0|0.29|0|17|1|movies

ejz6gg|2020-01-04 17:05:58|The Lighthouse: I just don’t get it.|"I rarely go to the movies. I vastly prefer watching a film at home. It takes a lot to get me to go see something in the theater, but I made one of my infrequent trips to the local theater to see Robert Eggers' newest film, The Lighthouse. Ever since its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, this film has been wowing critics all over the world, receiving critical acclaim from everyone who saw it. The concept sounded interesting, and I enjoyed the trailer, so I decided to check it out as soon as possible.

The first thing many people are mentioning, and the thing that immediately hits you when the film begins, is the aspect ratio it was filmed in. The movie is shot in a boxy format, tossing aside the usual widescreen format in favor of a much more compact frame. This offers an immediate feeling of claustrophobia and gave me hope that I was in for an exciting movie experience.

Unfortunately, the atmosphere caused by the aspect ratio and the choice to shoot in black and white over color is where my praise for this movie begins and ends. I am not going to sugar coat it or go in half-way with backwards insults. To put it bluntly: I hated this movie. HATED. I hated everything about it. I hated what passed for a story. I hated the acting. I hated the actual shot composition in every way that wasn't involving the aspect ratio. I hated the damn foghorn that went off seemingly every 30 seconds for the entirety of the film's duration.

When I read the buzz on this movie, all I heard about was the amazing acting, the incredible cinematography, and the excellent story. Critics and audiences alike were falling over themselves as they heaped praise on this film, calling it a masterpiece. This leads me to think one of two things has happened here: Either A- I am too stupid to understand what I saw, or B-nobody understood this movie, and didn't want to admit it, so they figured if they found it overly confusing, it must be brilliant.

This movie is supposed to be a psychological thriller, following two isolated men's decent into madness, but it actually plays more like a parody of independent film. This movie is one long cliché from start to finish.

Black and white? Check

Big movie star in a small movie trying to get taken seriously as more than a tween heart throb? Check.

Older character actor in a prominent role? Check.

Dream sequences interspersed in such a way that you can't tell what is real and what is fantasy? Check

Atmospheric background ""music"" with zero melody? Check

Open ended, pretentious non-finale that answers zero questions and can be interpreted any number of ways by an audience too embarrassed to admit nothing they saw made any sense? Check and double check!

I would give a spoiler warning, but even though I sat through this movie, I still have no clue what happened. There was a lot of yelling. Foghorns. A lot of screaming. Foghorns. Rain. Foghorns. Fighting. Foghorns. Dream sequences. Rain. Foghorns. More fighting. More foghorns. More yelling. A fight scene between Robert Pattenson and a seagull. Foghorns. Some more fighting. Rain. And for good measure, foghorns. Then a horrible ending.

I have been racking my brain trying to figure out the best way to describe the experience of watching The Lighthouse and I think I have come up with the perfect way to do so. Have you ever had somebody try to describe a dream to you, but the dream made zero sense, and they barely remember it? They are rambling on, backtracking, trying to describe something that they themselves didn't understand, makes zero sense, and they don't actually remember? That painful conversation usually lasts about three minutes. Now have that conversation for an hour and forty five minutes, while a foghorn blasts in your ear over and over. That is what watching The Lighthouse is like.

There are two people credited with the screenplay for this movie, but I refuse to believe an actual script exists. I have put more thought into this movie review than the screenwriters did the actual movie. It is good that the movie is so dark and everything is hard to make out, because both Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson do so much over acting, that I am convinced the scenery had actual bite marks in it. Half of the movie is so confusingly shot, I could barely tell the two actors apart. Even the rain looked overly fake. I swear if the camera panned over a few feet to the side, you would see people with buckets and sprinklers at the ready. The only person who went above and beyond in their job performance in the making of this movie was whomever was responsible for sounding the foghorn. That person deserves a special Oscar for stamina.

The characters in this movie spend the majority of the story questioning their sanity, and I have to admit, I know exactly how they feel. I am highly selective in what I go to see, and as a result, I rarely see a movie I don't enjoy to some degree. Yet I absolutely hated every second of this movie. Am I that out of touch with my own tastes? Am I losing my sense of self? I no longer know what is real. Who am I? How could I have been so wrong? Why is a movie I flat out loathed getting such universal acclaim? Is there something I am missing? Have I become incapable of recognizing genius? Or are these critics just covering for the fact that they didn't understand this movie any more than anyone else in my theater did?

As I left, I was thinking to myself how I had just witnessed the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I was in stunned silence at being so wrong in thinking I would like this movie, when I overheard other people talking about the film. I felt a small measure of relief in the fact that every single one of them was talking about how terrible the movie was. I didn't hear one positive thing being said by the other movie-goers in my theater. So what did we all miss?

I am left with a feeling of confusion as I try to make sense of what I saw. At first, I thought it was not believable that two men would descend into madness over a period of only a few weeks, yet this movie managed to do it to me in less than two hours, so I guess it is more believable than I initially thought. Still, just because the movie was confusing and made me question my own relationship with myself, it did not do so in the way it intended. The only way I could see Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe going so crazy so quickly is if they were able to watch themselves in this movie, like the scene in Spaceballs where Rick Moranis is watching the VHS of the movie to figure out what is going on and gets to the part of the movie he is actually doing at that time.

Needless to say, I can not recommend this movie in any way. I went in excited, and left heartbroken. I thought this movie was going to be everything that I love about film making, but was instead, almost like a dark parody of it instead. This was (and I say this with all sincerity, and what I believe to be full command of my mental faculties) the worst movie I have ever seen."|MrJKFrostyTSMofPA|False|https://redd.it/ejz6gg|0|0.34|0|12|1|movies

There are 2 assistants for a high level corporate boss and the boss invites them to his house to compete for an executive level promotion, with the other losing their job. Major plot points I remember are that the husband and wife argue almost contantly and the husband ends up taking a bolt action rifle off the wall and shooting his wife in the head. After realizing what he has done, the boss asks the 2 assistants what they would do to get out of the situation. After debating over plans, they go to check if the wife is dead and it turns out the whole thing was an act and she is still alive. Eventually one assistant shoots the other in the hand because he thought there were blanks in the gun. Another thing that happens is the boss records one assistant talking shit about his girlfriend and then plays it back to her at a later time, obviously causing a dispute between them. The plot gets a little fuzzy there for me but the next thing I remember is this disabled kid in a wheelchair is rolled out and the boss and wife are pretty much abusing him by pouring liquor down his throat and other things. The girlfriend of one of the assistants finally has enough of the shit they're being put through, picks up the gun and shoots the boss in the chest. The wife of the boss tries to attack her but is also shot dead. As they head outside they are met in the driveway by a lot of old men in masks. The last thing I remember is them saying something along the lines of ""Do you know what you've just done? You've just cleared x million dollars off our payroll next year""

ejs0ab|2020-01-04 04:57:01|What do you like in the pre-TGBH Wes Anderson movies?|"After hearing good things about Wes Anderson for a long time, I decided to give his movies a go and decided on TGBH. It was brilliant and entered my favourites’ list.

The use of miniatures (and stop-motion) was very obvious, as if Anderson wanted us to know he’d used them and my experience was elevated hundredfold. It was like seeing a storybook/comic book in movie format.

The humour was top-notch.

The acting, especially by Ralph Fiennes was brilliant.

The ‘Society of Secret Keys’ (?) scene was innovative and extraordinarily.

And other charms and quirks I had never seen in another movie before.

Wes Anderson suddenly became my one of my favourite filmmakers and I decided to binge on his other movies. Now here’s the problem. 
His other movies were nowhere near TGBH in quirkiness (as far as I could discern anyway and I’m not an expert in movies).

I watched ‘The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou’. It was weird. The plot was meandering, there were plot conveniences, and Anderson’s use of stop-motion and animation to bring his sea animals to life made me cringe because it was as if he didn’t want you to notice he had done so, unlike in TGBH. The movie was a drama/comedy but really didn’t work on both fronts for me. I’ve seen movies in both drama and comedy and even in drama/comedy genres better than this movie. But still, it was quirky to a lesser degree in some aspect I can’t put my finger on.

I watched ‘Rushmore’. It was meh. It was hilarious at some points, but a bore most of the time and had nothing in it that distinguished Wes Anderson’s work from another director’s. A love-triangle with a predictable ending.

I watched ‘The Darjeeling Limited’ and I have to admit it resonated with me far more than the other two. The plot was better, drama was better and comedy more consistent and hilarious and good use of Indian soundtracks. It’s my number two Wes Anderson movie (so far) but it still had none of the extreme quirkiness of TGBH.

I still have to and will watch The Royal Tenenbaums and Battle Rocket but since my movie sense isn’t refined yet, wanted to ask you what you liked in his pre-TGBH movies since they aren’t so quirky and there are better films in their genres."|Karth_Kaz|False|https://redd.it/ejs0ab|0|0.29|0|12|1|movies

ejjxo2|2020-01-03 19:01:40|I kinda liked Cats|"First off, my history with the musical. Someone put on the first film version of the musical when I was 10 or so, and I had to turn it off within 15 minutes. Cats played by humans in skin tight suits was not my idea of a good time. I found it extremely unsettling. A couple years ago, I had a gf who was a huge fan of the musical/movie and made me watch it. Still found it quite unsettling, but was able to enjoy how ridiculous it was...for a while. Eventually, I couldn't follow what was going on, it seemed like there was no plot, just cats taking turns singing. Quite boring.

All this to say, that the unsettling weirdness and bare necessity plot are baked into the musical itself. Don't know how you'd get rid of that.

About the movie...first off the CGI. It's very, very strange, can't deny that. The cats have  entirely human hands, mouths and noses, and not only that but the flesh around their mouths is often a different skin tone. Jennifer Hudson's...I don't know what the fuck is going on. I really don't think this movie is made for ""so-bad-its good"" watching, but if there's one thing that may be so-bad-its good, is that aspect of it.

Now, on to the rest of it... it's totally fine. Every change that was made to the musical was one that was helpful to turning it into the movie. They added a lead character to it, and while she doesn't do all that much, it is useful to have that perspective to see the story from. They added a new song for her, which works, it's a good song, it adds something to the jennifer hudson character moments. They made the villain character do a little more throughout the movie, and changed up the end conflict a bit. Still, not much there, but there's a little bit of a plot now, which was necessary.

The best thing about it are the songs. Musical songs are often really irritating to me, but you kinda just have to let it go and appreciate the catchiness. There are some very good songs in Cats, and I'm still singing them today. Gus' song is great, Ian McKellan was very good, maybe better than the stage version. Jason Derulo did his cheesy Prince-esque song perfectly. Jennifer Hudson, did *alot,* but the middle aged women behind me in the theatre were crying, so it must have been good. Skimbleshanks is a fun song.

The London setting, with rain slicked cobblestone streets was beautiful. The ballet was as well, despite CGI. Without motion capture, you would lose the human element...I think this movie would have been awful with full CGI cats that look like actual cats. Honestly I kinda like the CGI weirdness, and yes I do think the cats looked pretty hot. Francesca Hayward and Taylor swift especially.

It's ridiculous, kinda stupid, and catchy. All that head rubbing at the end was hilarious. Tom Hooper is a good director. They're jellicles. What's not to like?"|ChemicalSand|False|https://redd.it/ejjxo2|0|0.51|0|5|1|movies

I am a huge comic book fan and always loved characters like flash, nightwing, and spiderman. I loved the classic comedic superhero, who uses comedy to cope with difficulties they encounter in their life. It seems strange to see a beloved character fought over like it was a commodity. Any more movies have focused less about telling a story, which leaves the audience asking questions about their own lives. Directors such as Hitchcock and Orson Welles did not create a movie with the sole goal of making money. They had a vision they wanted to share with the world. Whenever I watch a truly resounding movie I leave the theater believing there is something bigger than humanity. I belive that movies are another art form. Artists do not create art with money in mind. Cinema has changed drastically over the 200 years of it existing. I am afraid that movies will focus solely on making money and will prevent other great directors from sharing their vision with the world.

 I started off the 2020's by picking up a subscription to the Criterion Channel, just so I would have plenty to watch on the last few days of my holiday break. 

The first film I watched was Jean-Pierre Melville's 'Le Samouraï', a film that had been on my list for quite a while. After finishing it, I cannot recommend it enough.

This feels like the precursor to a *ton* of modern films. The DNA of films from 'Drive' to 'John Wick' and more clearly trace back to this movie. Le Samouraï itself pulls a lot from American Noir, but brings that European subtlety and slickness to make something very fresh.

A short synopsis: The film follows a contract killer who works to keep himself alive after he's witnessed performing a hit. 

It's simple, but thrives on it's tension and style. Alain Delon is the prototype for the many short-spoken professional characters we see nowadays. The violence rare, but explosive and gritty. 

Anyways, highly recommended. I don't think there are many people who would find this unenjoyable."|TheNicholasRage|False|https://redd.it/eiyjpq|188|0.91|0|61|1|movies
ejj3i4|2020-01-03 18:03:34|Man from U.N.C.L.E. has been reevaluated, let's also reopen the case for King Arthur|"I've been loving how often Man From Uncle comes up these days- it frequently comes up as an underrated gem and a movie deserving of a sequel. Most people seemed to miss it on its initial release, and even the critical response was lukewarm from those who saw it. I really loved it and it's become one of the most rewatchable movies released in the last decade.

With a new Guy Ritchie movie coming out, I'm seeing reviews again coming out strong with mentions on his directorial flourishes and stylistic choices. It seems like you either love or hate it, but to me they're what make his movies so much fun from Lock Stock, to Sherlock Holmes, and Man From Uncle. It's got me thinking back on King Arthur, which seems to be one of his most panned movies that's been largely forgotten to time. This thing only came out in 2017, but it feels like forever ago that we heard chatter of the  planned 5 movie series!

Just like Man From Uncle, I think this one seriously deserves some reevaluation. While not quite as perfect with pacing a bit choppier, it's still solid. It's this weird blend of fantasy, big battles, and street level shenanigans with some really great energy infused from Ritchie's cross cutting and playful back and forth through dialogue and montages. Daniel Pemberton turned in one of my favorite scores, with some great bangers to listen to when you want ta burst of energy. We have an interesting villainous turn from Jude Law, and Charlie Hunnam turns in a fun performance that's easily my favorite outside of Lost City of Z. 

I think there's really something there if you leave your expectation for what a King Arthur story has traditionally been, and by the end the pieces were in place for a very interesting sequel. Unfortunately I think the movie's biggest disservice to itself was leaving out the most interesting elements of the legend and saving them for later, but I really wish we could have seen Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere, and Merlin's later adventures through this interpretation.

TL,DR: If you enjoyed Man from Uncle and other Ritchie movies, try giving King Arthur a chance for another kinetic movie that went underrated"|scottland517|False|https://redd.it/ejj3i4|2|0.51|0|24|1|movies

Nicolas' character is recently out of jail for gang-related activities, and wants a fresh start. His gang doesn't like the fact that he wants to turn over a new leaf, so they kidnap Adam's wife and children, one of whom is pregnant, and demands a ransom and Nicolas' reinstatement in the gang in exchange.

ej65qw|2020-01-02 23:17:18|Movies that make the urban environment one of the main characters|"Michael Mann is probably the director who best understands how to put a city at the centre of his films. All of his films but especially **Thief**, **Heat**, **Collateral**, and  **Miami Vice** would not be the same if he hadn't made their urban environments such a core aspect of the films and a living, breathing, playground for their characters to commit crimes and catch bad guys in. Even **The Insider**, ostensibly a legal drama, is shot as if the city is simultaneously overwhelming and crushing Russell Crowe's character. 

Scorsese, of course, is another master of this. I'm sure I don't need to go into detail about **Taxi Driver** or **After Hours** or **Gangs of New York**; his handling of the urban environments in these films (and more) is apparent from the second you watch them. 

What other films successfully pull off this double whammy of incredible aesthetics and lifelike characterization? I find that even movies with amazing shots of cities and urban areas like **The Dark Knight** and **Blade Runner 2049** fail at the second part of this. The cities feel like backdrops or excuses to flex aesthetically (more than happy to hear opinions to the contrary though), but still firmly in the background. And then there's stuff like **The Town** where the city has a major role but is aesthetically nothing special. Films like Taxi Driver and Miami Vice go beyond that, they make the characters feel beholden to the city, making the city a living and breathing object, *and* look fantastic while doing it.

Hello redditors.

I watched a movie a few years ago about a group of teenagers that threw a house party. During the party, one of the girl claims to be raped and her friends beat the nerdy guy thinking he did it and end up killing him.

The movie takes place in 24 hours, it starts in the party and it ends the next day afternoon. I also think it's inside, at least 90% of the scenes are inside the house. It ends with them putting the body in a van.

I come across this list of ""every movie of the 2010's, ranked"" and figure it should be pretty interesting to see where some of my personal favorites rank according to this list.  Now I understand people are totally entitled to their own opinions yadda yadda yadda, and usually I don't particularly give a shit if someone doesn't have the same opinion on something that I do, but good lord this is bad.  So bad that I decided to take the time to tell a bunch of strangers on the internet about it.  The article said they ranked 5,279 movies and Wind River came in at... 5,230.  Hell or High Water (#13) and Wind River were definitely two of my favorite movies I've seen from this decade, and I thought they were both very powerful movies that were pretty similar in tone.  Is there anyone out there who actually agrees with this write-up?

## 5,230. Wind River

That Taylor Sheridan has managed to have work on both ends of this list speaks to his particular strengths as a filmmaker and what happens when he departs from them. Wind River is technically Sheridan’s second film as a director, and third as a screenwriter, and while it shares the machismo of Hell or High Water, it has none of the incisive accompanying critique or underlying sense of economic despair. Instead, it tells what it clearly wants to believe is a story about violence against Native-American women, but is in actuality a self-congratulatory cowboy fantasy starring Jeremy Renner as a near-superheroic avenger who kicks ass and takes names and then delivers a climactic speech on behalf of indigenous pain. And as his rookie FBI-agent sidekick, Elizabeth Olsen gets stuck being the action-movie equivalent of the romantic-comedy lead who falls down all the time because the writer believes it makes her approachable. —A.W."|bingo_bango_dongo|False|https://redd.it/ejizqy|0|0.4|0|14|1|movies

At first, Clemenza says that the carpet belongs to his friend and he (Clemenza) would gift it to Vito to return the favor - sounds good. But once they enter the house and Clemenza takes out his gun to shoot a police officer it becomes evident that Clemenza doesn't know the owner of the house and Vito is an accessory to burglary.

Why would Vito accept the gift and bring it to his home? This is especially odd given that in the previous scene Vito rejects a food basket from his ex-employer. Up until this scene, Vito comes off as a man of principles, who only cares about his family. On a x500 viewing of the movie, it struck me why would he jeopardize his family by stealing a carpet and bringing it to his house (surely the police could potentially find out that he stole it)?"|wisenheimer51|False|https://redd.it/ejcg3h|2|0.57|0|6|1|movies

It is a brilliantly crafted story and touches on the many aspects of a stereotypical high school life (at least at the time). I found that many of the ideas and themes have carried over into today's schools, and the film holds up with the times really well. In particular, the one scene at the end where they all discuss their issues in a circle really resonated and almost made me cry. It was a very relateable scene for me and evoked some fairly interesting emotions/reactions out of me. Overall, I really love this movie and can see myself watching it again in the future. This is one of the few classic movies I have on my watch list, and I'm excited to see what more of these classic films have to offer.

Vibrant performances, gorgeous cinematography, and pitch-perfect art direction. Meryl Streep  anchors an already solid production with her perfectly-rendered Aunt March. I found it to be a worthy, charming, and courageous retelling.|textfile|False|https://redd.it/eg3qfx|32|0.63|0|29|1|movies

e34fxa|2019-11-28 21:16:50|Tired of “Black pain porn” films. Let’s discuss positive black films and portrayals|"I’m writing this after watching the double feature of Queen and Slim and Waves yesterday. 

Hollywood is churning out “black pain porn.” What is a“black pain porn” film? They are depressing films which usually deal with the same old storyline remixed: black people are dealing with intense poverty/discrimination and/or being killed by cops, or white people, or white cops, and/or being sent to prison. Examples  of black pain porn films are: Harriet, Blindspotting, Queen and Slim, Waves, Birth of a Nation, Moonlight, Fruitvale Station, Precious, 12 Years a Slave, etc. Some of those films were beautifully shot and had amazing acting but all did two things for me as a black man: left me feeling depressed and traumatized. ***I am TIRED OF SEEING BLACK BODIES RIDDLED WITH BULLETS*** It is not okay.

Positive black portrayals: Little, Last Black Man in SF, Black Panther, Love and Basketball, Brown Sugar, The Pursuit of Happiness.

I’m done spending money to watch films where I leave it wondering why the world hates me for something I have no control over. So, I want to stop feeding that negativity. Let’s discuss positive films about black people. What did you like about the film?

Edit: thanks to whoever gave me the gold and platinum awards. I’m thankful to everyone who made a ***positive*** contribution to this thread and listed films I’ve never heard of. Looking forward to watching more positive representations of blackness!

Edit #2: I can’t not keep individually responding so:

1. Some of y’all are seriously missing the point of my post. ***IT IS TRAUMATIC FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO CONSTANTLY SEE BLACK  BODIES RIDDLED WITH BULLETS IN FILMS. It does something to your mental health.*** Your opinion about whether or not bpp need to exist isn’t the point, the shit is toxic for our mental health and creates a deep seated anxiety that is subconscious. ***We need more positive representations of blackness to combat all of the negative portrayals.*** I know that many of the films I listed are biopics and  that those stories “need” to be told, but black joy also exists, yet that story RARELY gets told. The media consistently paints the black experience as a constant struggle and it’s very easy to feel oppressed and disheartened if you don’t see other perspectives that let you know all black people arent struggling and some are happy and thriving!

2. For everyone saying I’m over exaggerating: it’s interesting that there aren’t a lot of suggestions for positive black films from 2019. Dolemite has been suggested, ***what other positive black films do you suggest from 2019?*** if there are sooo many positive portrayals of blackness from 2019, why aren’t people suggesting them?🤔

3. I’m not having anymore ***DRAINING*** conversations with y’all about race. Stop asking! Interested in race related conversations, then I recommend that you read books on ***intersectionality and post traumatic slave syndrome***  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Traumatic_Slave_Syndrome
Michelle Alexander has a great book about mass incarceration in our “post racial America.”
