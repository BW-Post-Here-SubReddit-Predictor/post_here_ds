e3ftbf|2019-11-29 15:03:21|Rules simplification|"Hello LPT subscribers, 

This community has existed for nine years and has more subscribers than some smaller countries have citizens. (Belgium has 11.4m) 

We find  that over time our rules have become bloated and unwieldy, making the subreddit hard to moderate and more importantly, difficult to post to. 

Each rule we have was added for a very good reason at the time. (In the sidebar there is a rule saying no tips about rubber snakes. A few years ago there was an issue with rubber snake tips.)

But over the years we have added rule after rule and never removed any and this resulted in rules creep,  a sort of nightmarish morass you guys need to navigate when you want to post here. 

This ends today. We're massively overhauling the rules, removing most of the restricted tip list and making participating here a  lot easier.

------------------------------------

**Rules that we will keep**

No tips about:

Legal, parenting, driving, tips that break the law, hygiene (including toilet), religious, relationship, troll/ joke.

And no ads. No tips that are really just recommending a product or service. No ""Get Disney+, it's great"". 

----------------------------------------

It's going to take some time to get all this arranged, especially automod is a complete disaster of rule upon rule and legacy code that requires detailed attention. During this transition some posts that are not technically against the rules anymore may still be removed. We also reserve the right to keep removing content under moderator discretion, when we feel it's not a good fit for the sub but is not codified in our existing ruleset. 

But in general we feel that this overhaul will make it much simpler and enjoyable to participate here.

This is the least you could do to reduce chances of collisions.

edit: seems like there are many comments advocating a lane switch. Just want to note that city roads and highways often have different laws. In city roads, you do not have to stay on a specific lane when you're not passing. Additonally, generally lane changes increase risk of accidents. A  third point is that turns are everywhere in the city, and you do not want to be switching lanes to let tailgaters pass, when you need to be on the current lane to make a turn.

edit2: while it is satisfying and feels powerful to frustrate tailgaters by doing _________ (e.g. brake check, slowing down to unreasonable speeds), that is not safe. Whatever sense of satisfaction gained from that is hardly worth the risk.

edit3: quoting u/foxtrotsierratango's great point.

>More time to react leaves out the important clarification: Make your actions much more gradual so the car behind you doesn't have to deal with a drastic change. Instead of coming up to a pack of cars and braking, take your foot off the accelerator and coast gently applying brakes as needed. Accelerate slowly and evenly.

Without a surface to stick to, your dishes won’t get as squeaky clean.
Consumer Reports offers another explanation. According to the product-testing magazine, newer dishwashers—those purchased within the last five years or so—won’t wash your dishes for very long if the sensors in the machine don’t detect much dirt in the water. “When that happens, the dishwasher gives them just a light wash, and items come out less than sparkling,” Consumer Reports's Ed Perratore wrote in 2016. “To avoid that lackluster result, don’t rinse; just scrape off bits of loose food.”"|sisyphushaditsoeasy|False|https://redd.it/ekwhgc|8|0.72|0|19|1|lifeprotips

ekffx2|2020-01-05 16:49:03|LPT: Can't seem to pull yourself away from Reddit, gaming, etc.? Try a series of decreasing-duration timers.|"Let's say you've found yourself sitting down and thinking, ""I'll do this for half an hour and then get up and go do something else"" and then, poof, you look at the clock and an hour and a half has passed.  Oops.

""Okay,"" you think, ""I'll give myself a deadline.""  So you set a timer for half an hour.  It rings...and you say ""I'm not quite done...just a couple more minutes,"" silence the alarm and go back to what you were doing.  Another hour passes.  :/

Here's one fix that works for me:

Set a first timer. ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes.""

It goes off.  Either get up or set a second one for half the time.  (""Alexa, set a timer for 15 minutes."")

Repeat.  The next timer is 7.5 minutes.  After that, it's 3 minutes and 45 seconds.

This approach is just intrusive enough to snap you out of whatever you're overly focused on, yet it allows you some choice at each decision point: set another timer or just get up and get on with your day.  Plus, when that 3:45 timer goes off, you're probably going to feel a little silly pondering ""what's half of 3:45, anyway? ... And do I really want to bother setting another timer for less than 2 more minutes?  I might as well just get up and get going.  After all, that was the whole point of the nonsense with the timers.""

Final note: it helps to have a specific, non-miserable plan to switch to.  If it's ""30 minutes and then I'll go start the taxes,"" well, good luck with that :) but ""30 minutes and then I'll take the dog for a walk"" is probably going to be much more doable."|ExNihiloAdInfinitum|False|https://redd.it/ekffx2|204|0.9|0|18|1|lifeprotips

What I mean is basically this: when I was 20 and I imagined different careers for myself, I essentially pictured myself at a party of some kind telling others what my job was. I never framed the question as ""here's the kinds of duties and tasks I'll have to do.  Would I enjoy doing things like that?""  And I have many peers who became lawyers or teachers because they wanted to *be* a lawyer or teacher, then actually got into the field and realized they hate the experience of actually performing the tasks of the job.

Here's a much better way to approach it, in my opinion: I get the most fulfilment at work when I'm solving difficult problems that I know impact the business.  I don't really want anyone to report to me and I want to go to as few meetings as possible.  I also prefer to interact with other employees rather than customers.  And I like shorter projects that don't hang over my head while I'm at home.

That's just me and I found a good niche for myself that checks all those boxes, but when framed that way, I realized that you could find roles like that in many different departments in many different kinds of businesses.

So I'm sure this has been said before in some shape, form, and/or fashion, but let me tell you how good these hackers are. Today I received a call from BBT. THE CALL CAME FROM BBT. From their* number I have personally called many times and have saved in my phone as BBT. It was their* fraud department and they wanted to let me know that there is suspicious activity on my account. A few minutes of verifying info and everything was cleared up. My account was locked and a new card was ordered. I was given a 1 time use login and password to re-setup my BBT online account and was told to allow 6-8 hours for everything to take effect.  Or so I thought. 
 
Within a few hours, I was wiped clean. $1.26 left in my bank. So I call BBT back to find out what's going on. I find out that I did not speak to BBT earlier today. I had instead been call spoofed by hackers and that I actually gave them all the info they needed (or better phrased, the last little bit of info they were looking for) to wipe my ass clean of all my money. I talked to the service guy for about 30mins. We hopefully have it official straighten out now. With my account actually locked and a legit new card on the way. There is a chance I may have to get a whole new account period. 
 
The one thing the service guy told me was that if I ever get a call from (my bank) to hang up and call back at a number I know is theirs. If it truly was them, they will know what the call was for. If they have no idea of any reason to call you, you were called by a hacker.
 
Edit: This has gained a massive amount of traction.

ejzgoi|2020-01-04 17:27:31|LPT. If you live anywhere that even occasionally gets wildfires, no matter the time of year or that you live in a city, you need to be prepared. So here's my family's list and method:|"Note: I was born and raised in Colorado. I have been evacuated because of and severely impacted by many fires. The two most notable being the Hayman fire in 2002 and Waldo Canyon in 2011. I have see it rain fire and ash and lived summers of smoke more that I can remember. My father was in search and rescue, and we are friends with firefighters, policeman and other personnel. 

Here is our method and list:

1. Get you renters/homeowners insurance in order. Get the best plan you can. It'll be worth it whether if you ever have to replace everything you own. Make sure it has provisions for covering a place to live/missed work.

2. Document everything. This is for several reasons. At a moment's notice, I can give my insurance a list of every item in my house and its value, should it ever need replacing. That is the largest value -- not the building but everything in it. Second, looting and robberies are very common in evacuation zones and while police may have blockades to evacuated neighborhoods they are often understaffed and not a priority (for obvious reasons).

3. Have all your important documents in a safe place. Mine reside in a fireproof safety deposit box with a bank who has measures to get our property quickly if the rest of the building burns. We also have other copies if needed.

4. Get a few, conspicuously marked (we put red tape on four boxes), boxes of anything important you can't bear to lose. Maybe baby pictures, family heirlooms etc. Make sure the amount is small enough that there is no having to Tetris your vehicle.

5. Make sure all family/household members know exactly what essentials to grab in a moment's notice. We have always been able to evacuate within 10 minutes.

6. For those with animals make sure they are microchipped and all information is updated and accurate. Keep important information pertaining to the, such as microchip number, name, breed, coloring, size, or anything other identifying information with your important documents. Remember, some animals, like cats will hide in the face of something like a fire and others are difficult to quickly transport. Make sure you have a plan in place for your pets.

7. Leave hoses/any material that could help firefights in conspicuous view but not so that it could be in their way. We also leave sprinklers on. We were once told that firefighters will try to save a house in a neighborhood wildfire up until the moment any of it catches fire. In that moment the focus is on protecting the undamaged structures and holding the line.

8. If there is any potential that an evacuation might be called DO NOT GO INTO WORK/LEAVE ANYONE AT HOME WHO HAS NO MEANS TO LEAVE ON THEIR OWN. Many police forces will not let anyone into a neighborhood once the order has begun. They will only let people leave.

9. Remember that most things can be replaced. Lives can't be. Put a plan in place.

*As for places to stay I'll note that we have generally stayed with family friends in other cities. I include pets with family.

Please let me know if I missed anything/you do anything different. I hope this is helpful.

This will unlock your motivation and stop you from procrastinating."|"One night, instead of fantasising on the many things I could do to drastically improve my life I decided to focus my attention on the reasons I can never do these things when the next day comes. I sat down and analysed why it is I will have zero motivation the next day to do these things. I was honest with myself and I came to a surprising and counter-intuitive conclusion.

The answer was simple, it's Fun! As in literally having fun and enjoying myself. In my midnight fantasies about the perfect life, I wasn't planning to have any fun, I was just planning for work and more boring ass work. Hit the gym, paint my house, buy a new carpet, get a bike, throw a party. Your brain reads this as HARD WORK, HARD WORK, WORK, HARD WORK, WORK. You can see why the mind defends it's self by making you recoil and procrastinate. Instead, what you need to do is VERY SIMPLE and it's simply, to plan for your FUN first and leave the other things unplanned. I'll give an example.

Today is Saturday, it's winter and it's cold outside... I want to plan my fun FIRST so, by 8:30pm I want to be on the couch, with a nice cup of herbal tea, Netflix is on and I want to see the Sully movie which I've been wanting to see for so long. That's it!

You will not believe how much of a motivation this will be for you. I tried it and WOW! I had the house cleaned, dinner cooked, I was shaved, showered, chores done, plants watered, odd jobs complete, I even did some push ups and called a few friends. WAS DONE WITH EVERYTHING BY 8:15! I CRACKED THE CODE! I had endless motivation and the closer the time came to 8:30pm the hard I worked.

I am posting this due to the LPT thread regarding banks earlier today. 

Many scammers WANT you to hang up, then call back your bank. This lulls you into a false sense of security which can cause you to give out information that can be used to steal your entire account. 

When someone calls you, they can forcibly keep the phone line connected and play the noises that make you assume that you have hung up and the dial tone/ringing is prerecorded. 

Make sure to call the bank after calling someone else first, and restarting your phone.  Make sure you haven't simply been connected to the same scammer.  

Be aware that your bank will not ask for sensitive information at any point over the phone. They do not need your email, address, account info if they called you at random the worker would have access to these details already."|lostallmyconnex|False|https://redd.it/ek4ts7|3|0.53|0|16|1|lifeprotips

Story time; I worked for an educational organizational for five years. The way the administration handled my position this year frustrated me to the point that I looked elsewhere for other employment. I quickly found a better paying position. They wanted me to start right away. I told them the only way I could accept the position was if I gave my old employer enough time to find someone to take over my responsibilities and give me time to train them (roughly 3 weeks.) They agreed. On my final day at the old job my boss told me straight out that she would be working on getting a new position created this summer that was above my previous position and would have me first in mind to fill it. Not only that but when I ran into my old boss during my first week at my new job her exact words were “we desperately miss you.” 

I could’ve easily walked out without notice. I was upset at how things turned out with my position. I felt incredibly unappreciated. But by not burning that bridge, I’ve kept a door open for myself in my career for a better position, networking and references.

The issue with this is the [expense ratio](https://www.morningstar.com/InvGlossary/expense_ratio.aspx) or amount charged to manage the fund is *significantly* higher than that of a S&P 500 index fund (a fund that tracks the performance of the largest companies), and the returns that target retirement funds bring are lower. 

**Example**

* Fidelity 2050 Target Retirement Fund [(FFFHX)](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315792416)
10 yr returns = +9.3% with a 0.75% Expense Ratio

10 yr returns = +13.54% with a 0.015% Expense Ratio

This means if you were invested in the retirement fund for the past 10 years, you paid an expense that was **50x more** than the cheaper total index fund that would have given you 4.24% higher returns.

You can even write down the very small things in life that people normally take for granted. And hopefully this will help you in general. 

Research has shown that people who write gratefulness lists before bed are 25% happier and more mindful than those who don’t. 

Here is an example of a gratefulness list, from me (I date them, as I make one every few days) 

~Things to be Grateful 01/02/2020 ~ 
1. Being able to sleep well at night 
2. Getting to work on time 
3. For Shane who gave me a stamp 
5. The coffee that Von brewed so I didn’t have to 
6. For the customers at work not being terrible today 
7. Being kept warm by my raincoat 
8. For getting home safely even with the rain 
9. Having time to watch The Witcher 

So this is just an example of things I could appreciate in my life. It ranges from more obvious things, like having enough time to watch Netflix, to smaller things like getting to work on time. 

Of course once again, this isn’t going to cure anybody,  but it’s a way to be more appreciative of your greater surroundings and I hope it’ll make you happier overall."|purpleoctodog|False|https://redd.it/ejn6m4|187|0.83|0|47|1|lifeprotips

They charged a fee due to some modifications and got me running within a week - with about $1000 I had a brand new heat furnace, i was quoated 2500-4000 by 5 other places.

eilqnx|2020-01-01 18:33:33|LPT: If someone you know suffered a great loss and you want to show support, here are some do's and don'ts|"I lost my wife a few weeks ago and received a whole lot of support messages. This may be a bit subjective, but seeing how I felt about most of these, and what I am going through since, I now know what I will and won't do when something similar happens to someone I know, so I wanted to share:

The first contact, right after you get the news, is important because it shows you care, but don't try to find the right words, or worse, don't state that there is no words that can ease their pain. This is obvious, and you are the 1000th one to say that. They know. They just need to know you're there.

Do not, in any case, state that if they need anything, they can call you. Yes, I need to talk to someone after the kids are asleep, I need the hedge trimmed, I need someone to look after the kids on Thursday, I need a second income to keep paying my bills, I need a friend with benefit to compensate for my brutal lack of physical interactions. Don't make them draw the line between what's reasonable and what's not. Don't make them chose who to call among the fifty people that were this vague in case they actually have a need they find reasonable.  If you think you can bring something specific, be specific. They need to know you are the one to call in this specific situation.

If the specific thing you have to offer is just to be available for a phone call when they need someone to talk to, then it is not enough to say it. One hundred people told me that I can call them whenever I need to talk, some of them specified ""even in the middle of the night"". It may be just me, but when I am trying to go on with my life and receive calls from different persons a couple of times a day, then I feel less alone. If I get nothing for a couple of days, then this situation is really depressing, and having a list of a hundred people I can interrupt in their daily lives to suck some comfort off, does not help at all. So just call them from time to time, weeks and even months after the fact. Show you think about them, don't make them call you out of despair.

&#x200B;

EDIT: before I go to bed, I just want to clarify a couple of things that induce misunderstandings that keep coming to my mailbox:

This is not a rant. I do not resent people that did the things I listed. As I stated in my first paragraph, I experienced the effect they had on me, I think I have learned things from this, I would like to share. I thought I was clear about this, but every support message I got was comforting. Some were just much more useful than others. 

The ""Do not, in any case"" intro is clearly horribly worded. Yes. My bad. What I mean is, when you say something so vague, it doesn't have any more effect than a simple ""sorry for your loss"". If you are genuinely willing to help, then this does not bring the message across.

The FWB part. Ok, I was illustrating how ""anything"" is completely useless in this context, because you make the person draw his own line between what is reasonable and what is not. To illustrate how this line was completely subjective, I gave several examples to illustrate the fact that you had to draw a line somewhere. Starting from something completely reasonable, finishing with something I thought everybody would consider unreasonable in this context. Three of these five examples are completely made up.

First, in order to start this, make sure you're **signed into Google using a Gmail account you've been using the longest**. The older the account, the more farther back you can look. Next go to [myactivity.google.com](https://myactivity.google.com) and you're almost there. Here where it may get creepy. It shows all your Google searches and how many times and at what times you visited any websites, searched anything on Google, and which apps you've opened. Yeah, pretty creepy. But whatever, I think you can delete it somewhere.

Next, you can click on the filter options, and just think back to when you created your Gmail account. I created mine sometime before 2012, so my account is perfect for this. Long story short, filter the options using only the dates and set it to January 1st, 20XX, whatever that might be for you. And there you go, look back to what you Googled and which apps you were using and whatnot. More often than not, this will be nostalgic, and a bit creepy. But whatever. After looking back for a bit, I started rememebering what video games I was playing, which YouTubers I used to watch, and what information I was Googling.

Stay safe and Happy New Years.

EDIT: It's organized in a very weird way. You cannot choose to view older information first. Newest is always at the top. Click ""Before"" instead of ""After"" and select the date to be January 20XX, being one year ahead of the year you wanna view. Also you must view newest to oldest and cannot change it. So you'll start on May 31st, all the way to May 1st. If you wanna look at it chronologically, you have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and scroll up slowly.

Allow me to clarify that obviously this isn't something that will work for everyone.  There are as many causes for depression as there are people suffering from it, and just as many things will cause highs and lows.  I'm sorry if you're suffering and you read this and it isn't something that works for you, but at the same time please don't dismiss it as a ""fix"" for someone who is ""just feeling down"".  In fact this isn't a fix by a long shot, but it can be a temporary reprieve for those it does work for, even if that reprieve only lasts a few hours. 

I'm going to speak from a personal perspective, but this is a tip from both perspnal experience and from counselling and speaking with others.

I've found that one of the first things to fall by the wayside when suffering from depression is personal hygiene.  At my worst I'd go weeks without a shower because I couldn't bring myself to make the effort.

The thing is, I also noticed that when I actually did shower I'd experience a peak in my energy and mood, and I'd actually feel better about myself.  Conversely, the longer I went without showering the worse I'd feel.  So if you find yourself feeling worse and realise you're kinda grimy, try taking a quick shower.  This may seem kinda obvious, but the brain works in weird ways under depression.

This works as a tip for those keeping an eye out for friends and family.  If you notice someone's hair suddenly looking more frequently greasy or not as tidy as you're used to seeing, check in with them and see how they're feeling.  Maybe it'll be nothing more than stress or not sleeping as much as usual, but if they're in a slump, or falling into one, you could provide a much needed support without even realising it."|IbramSkyheart|False|https://redd.it/eidrgg|180|0.77|0|56|1|lifeprotips

Password management, different usernames per service, obfuscated security question responses, MFA where possible, ideally not SMS based codes.


Password. Management. 

Not a spreadsheet. Not a sticky note. Not a notebook. A proper password manager.

[Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) 
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) 
[1Password](https://1password.com/) 

The list goes on.

Whichever you use, secure it! Pass phrases are CRITICAL, not a simple fifteen character password. My phrases are 5-8 groupings of letters, numbers, and symbols. Some words. Some not. 

2FA/MFA

Move away from SMS TOTP (Time-based One Time PIN). Phone numbers can be moved by a bad actor walking into a carrier store and requesting a new SIM, with your number.

At the very least use google authenticator (though there are many other applications that do TOTP, like Authy.
Think about integrating a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/)  into your security workflow.  NFC capable Yubikeys combined with your phone can very securely generate TOTPs, and are all but immune to compromise because they live on the key, not your device. 

Yubikeys and other security keys also support, where supported by your site/service, U2F/FIDO2, which is a challenge/response method of MFA

Usernames 

Think about, where possible, using a separate username per service. My online banking profile was partly compromised (but stopped by mandatory MFA on the part of my bank) because my username was dumped in a database breach of some service or other. At that point I started using unique usernames for almost everything, but especially high value/high security services.

Security questions.

You’re using a password manager, right? This means you already don’t worry about, or know, your usernames and passwords. Take that one step further and include security question responses. If you can’t be socially engineered out of responses to “what’s your cats name?” Then you’re much much better off. An example. Say my cats name was seventeen. My answer, stored in my pw manager, would be “6plusfive+six”.

Account PIN’s.

Things like your cellphone carriers account pin that you need to make changes on the account. It can be added as a secure note on the account, and most carriers require it when making changes in store."|rubles89|False|https://redd.it/eikubr|10|0.93|0|16|1|lifeprotips

ehnjae|2019-12-30 15:39:57|LPT: When you receive a hospital bill, ask them for an itemized bill and it will be much cheaper|"Example: You get an expensive bill for a $1,000 unfortunately. U.S. healthcare really shouldn’t be so expensive in the first place...but the first thing you should do is call and ask for a review of the level of care, and while on the phone the next thing you do is ask for an itemized bill with every single charge. 

They make bills unnecessarily expensive because in the backend of things, they rack up ridiculous charges like $37 for a bandaid. Once you call and request what I’ve mentioned, they’ll knock all the BS charges right off before sending you the itemized statement.
 
Some bills can go down from $500 to $45. It may not be that drastic for everyone, but many can be reduced by several hundreds of dollars.

If you or anyone you know has been to the ER recently, tell them to try this. It can majorly help!

You can try to even further this by looking for medical debt reconciliation companies. They make money by cutting down on your debt, even in cases like these.

If you have insurance, you can contact your insurance company and ask for a breakdown of what was billed as well.  Most services you were billed for likely weren’t even done. So yes ALWAYS ask for an itemized bill, they get scared and remove a whole bunch of items!

You can also apply for medical financial assistance (MFA). Every hospital has it, you just need to submit financial info and they will pay it all or half. Sometimes you can even get medicine and visits waived for 6 months or more. 

Another thing you can do for extra help is ask to apply for charity. The charity department will ask questions about your income situation however, but many people do lie about their income. There’s a chance you’ll get approved and your account is adjusted to zero balance.

EDIT: this may be a bit simplified and there’s some contradictory statements in the comments, but I don’t think you should be discouraged from trying it because it has 100% WORKED for many... such as people in this thread saying it reduced their bill firsthand, hospital employees confirming this, genuine comments on twitter of people sharing their experience with it and how much it lowered their bill, and other videos of people explaining their situation showing gratitude for having learned this info because it saved them a lot of money... no “propaganda” or angrily fueled desire to spread misinformation.

That means the zoom feature is what's called a digital zoom, which just zooms in on the image and doesn't actually manipulate the lenses to get a true zoom in on the object. That's why the quality degrades the closer you zoom in. 

Unless you have a newer phone with multiple cameras that are built to different focal lengths, zooming in just degrades the overall quality of the image. It also makes it harder to get a clean shot because the more you zoom in the more every little shake and tremble affects the image. 

**Solution:** the image will have the same quality whether you zoom in or not, so just stay zoomed out to eliminate the shake and when you go to crop it out you have a lot more real estate to work with. 

Got the idea after a friend of mine showed me his 6K camera and told me about how now he doesn't need multiple cameras or to mess with it to get different shots. This is because he just crops it out in the editor to be a 1080p video rather than a 6k video.

If you enroll in COBRA before the 60  days are up, your coverage is  then retroactive, as long as you pay the retroactive premiums. This  means that if you incur medical bills during  your ""election period,""  you can retroactively — and legally — elect  COBRA and have those bills  covered.

If you incur any medical  expenses during those 60 days, find out is it cheaper to pay out of  pocket, or it is cheaper to pay back  premiums+deductibles+copays+coinsurance of your COBRA. Act accordingly.

Then  you have another 45 days to pay. This means you can retroactively  activate COBRA during 105 days total if you need it. Or just save money  if you don't. This may be a bit trickier, as this will be behind ACA  deadline of 60 days to get a plan through exchange.

This  way, have all your COBRA paperwork ready, filled out, in the envelope.  Tell your wife/roommate/realtive - if something happens to you, they  need to mail this.

TL:DR; when you’re a bystander in a victim/harasser conflict, a good way to de escalate and show support is to engage in friendly conversation with the victim. Especially if you aren’t comfortable engaging the aggressor. 

At the checkout line, the cashier was a little inexperienced and was having trouble with her machine. As she waited for help I smiled at her and patiently waited, noticing that she was becoming more flustered as people began queuing behind me. An older gentleman put his groceries on the belt and began to complain loudly and rudely about how long this was taking. I don’t normally think of a good way to approach awkward social situations but something in my brain clicked that day. As she became more uncomfortable and flustered I shifted slightly between them and began complimenting the cashier’s curly hair (mine is naturally curly as well and it can be a pain). I kept her engaged in conversation until a manager arrived and fixed her computer.  You don’t have to engage the harasser to show someone you have their back.

Edit; For those in the comments saying I should have called the guy out; I am 5 feet tall and somewhat introverted. Confronting this person for his rude behavior was not something I could have handled well.  I do not trust people to not be violent and I preferred not to draw any attention to myself.
