ekw0mt|2020-01-06 16:02:11|My mother started playing Witcher III|"I never tried to encourage her, because she gets vertigo watching me play Skyrim, just told her about the Witcher Netflix series.

She started to get curious, after I showed her a clip of Geralt and Jaskier. She likes dry humor and Fantasy. 

Then I saw her watching a Let's Play of Witcher III on the TV. She told me she was surprised she doesn't get dizzy watching it. She then wanted to try it herself and looked up prices. 

Told her she doesn't need to buy it. I had it already. She got all excited and literally pushed me towards her laptop to install it. 

Now she has a Steam account and I share my library with her. I gave her my controller, so she can sit further away to avoid vertigo. She killed Geralt in the tutorial and runs against every wall, but she will figure it out. 

She loves the landscape, Roach and the story. She is retired and in her early sixties, so she has got time to explore.

ekrk1w|2020-01-06 09:02:13|I‚Äôm a 33 year old life long gamer and I live on Maui. Today my heart broke. The digital age is it.|"I live on maui and I always have. I was born here and have always lived and gamed here for the most part. My First gaming system was a gameboy. Contrary to the title of this post, we actually lived in Australia when I got my gameboy. My mother was a glass blower and my father was a fisherman. My mom would blow glass and we would travel to do craft shows to make money. I hated it but I absolutely fell in love with my gameboy. It let me escape. I don‚Äôt know why I hated the traveling life, because it was a pretty cool life thinking back. We ended up coming back home to maui and I reunited with my friend who had also been gifted a gameboy. It was a weird experience but it was how we connected, the first handheld consoles we owned and we were absolutely consumed. 

Years went by and we stayed up endless nights playing sega genesis and Super Nintendo. We each owned one and had specific games we played on each system. It gives me good feelings thinking about those times. I remember playing sega saturn and that VR version of sega saturn that had the tennis game? What the heck was that? It was aweeaome. There was sega dream cast and that fighting game. PlayStation one and metal gear solid. My first true gaming experience with a story. I got that for Christmas. Nintendo 64 Mario. Mario Kart and Mario party. PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo cube and wii. PS3 and 4 and everything that I have played.... has become a part of me. 

The house I currently live in for the the last 5 years doesn‚Äôt have internet access. That‚Äôs fine, I play games for the stories they tell. They have an emotional attachment to me. Sometimes games are released with a day one patch.. that sucks but that‚Äôs fine I take
My PlayStation to work and hook it up in my office, I use a seperate screen and WiFi to download the day one patch to play a game I have been waiting for.. sometimes it‚Äôs not necessary but sometimes it is.

I‚Äôve always had hard copies of my games, I like to bring them in and trade them for other games. Game stop has always been good like that. Today I went to the one of two GameStop‚Äôs that I have always gone to for years and found out they were closing. I was kind of devastated. More devastated than I thought I would have been. Mainly because I realized I was a 33 year old man in a dying age... the employees were sad and had found jobs elsewhere already but my heart was broken and I browsed the ps4 used section and didn‚Äôt find anything for the first time ever... I knew that I was being selfish but I also realized that my way was old and coming to an end."|MonkandBeer|False|https://redd.it/ekrk1w|17|0.7|0|20|1|gaming

Let me start off by apologizing because I am not a gamer. I'm sorry if I use the wrong words, as I dont knownthe lingo, but please correct me and let me know so that I can at least know what I'm talking about/looking for. I'm also on mobile so I also apologize for any formatting/spelling errors.

So my nephew is turning 12 years old and he loves to be on his new PC. He just bought extra memory so it holds something like 4 Terrabytes for all his computer games. He is super smart and goes to a coding class twice a week. He also loves minecraft, however, I think he has played the crap out of that game. He also just got something like $200 in steam gift cards for Christmas. 

Just as a side note, he is diabetic and has asthma so sports/physical activity really isn't in his ball park.

I really appreciate any advise/suggestions and, again, if this isn't allowed or if I need to fix anything, please let me know."|supportivegrandma|False|https://redd.it/ekvjl6|3|1.0|0|10|1|gaming

eku388|2020-01-06 13:22:50|Ghost Recon Breakpoint Full Review 2020|"Tom Clancy‚Äôs Ghost Recon Breakpoint Full Review:

-Gameplay: This part rips the smooth run and gunplay system from Wildlands and doesn‚Äôt change it, and it‚Äôs for the better since it‚Äôs a well done shooting system, however when it comes to stealth, the game also utilizes nearly every aspect from Wildlands but adds some gadgets that are meant to aid you in stealth, however most enemies are oddly placed far from each other + weird inconsistent AI that‚Äôs human like at times and blind at others results with a generally easy stealth system, with gadgets that should‚Äôve worked but felt irrelevant instead. The driving is decent this time, with some improvements over vehicle control however it is inconsistent with some vehicle types.

Story: The story starts off strong with some creative ideas, however after the 3 hour mark, it falls into being extremely repetitive with 2-3 mission designs, yes, they have 3 mission types, and each mission is based on getting to a base, killing/sneaking/shooting your way into the base to complete an objective and so on till the end. The cutscenes feel odd and most of the game-rendered scenes are inconsistent, the main villain himself is decent, he puts up a good performance and the flashbacks are interesting, however the screentime he‚Äôs put in is little and his motives aren‚Äôt clear, the acting on the other-hand by the main cast is great, Nomad (female) is good and Jon bernthal does an excellent job, overall the story is better than Wildlands but is a poor story overall.

Loot/Tier/Skill systems: Breakpoint tries to copy a lot from other games, but most of the additions don‚Äôt fit the game and are put in a unfinished matter, leveled clothes and weapons only make you vulnerable to higher level machines while human enemies are kill-able by headshots so it doesn‚Äôt work much here. The guns spread around have very similar sounds and lack much variety in terms of how they feel put they do play good. The skill tree feels more of ‚Äúmaking the gameplay‚Äù easier than actually adding something to enhance the experience.

(haven‚Äôt played online yet)

The world and graphics: the world is actually one thing they‚Äôve nailed for such a type of a game, the enemy bases are a lot and all of them are designed in an excellent manner, providing variety and the architecture is stunning. The graphics are decent, nothing special, but are good to look at times and majorly are just fine.

Bugs and UI: the game didn‚Äôt have much bugs in ordinary gameplay however going down and up slopes was extremely glitchy, it felt like a slog doing that, the animations were repetitive and felt like they didn‚Äôt connect 60% of time. The UI is odd, it‚Äôs fine for me, but it could‚Äôve been majorly better.

Overall, I had fun with breakpoint, however the stealth isn‚Äôt challenging and the story doesn‚Äôt have much to keep you engaged, but the large bases can encourage you to explore and infiltrate more, this isn‚Äôt the direction I wanted the series to go through, but this game wasn‚Äôt as bad as many said, it did however ruin the clean image Ubisoft has had since 2016 and it was overall a lower quality standard game compared to other titles.

ekvjgw|2020-01-06 15:25:51|Really need help finding Johnny Megatone (and other old TV games from the early 2000's)|" 

Back in the day I used to play a little game called Johnny Megatone (and it's sequels) on a tv channel that had a bunch of games on it you could play with your remote called Playin' TV. I know this channel has also gone by other names, but this is what it was called when I would play on it. In Johnny Megatone you played as the titular character on a mission to stop an evil doctor Z and retrieve your girlfriend. It was a platformer where you used a gun and bombs to progress your way to the exit. There were 3 large-scale levels in every iteration/sequel of the game and often had secrets scattered around. Other notable games on this channel included one called Carrot Mania, where you were a rabbit who had to collect carrots to progress to the next level. Below is a link to a Youtube video where a fellow like myself has collected all media he has been able to find about this game to hopefully help in some way:

ekvdh4|2020-01-06 15:12:58|Can't focus on the game|"I'll try to explain it in the shortest way possible.

Basically when I play, and I am focused (not in the flow, but still really focused), I can easily kill people, my aim is insanely good. When I am not, I cannot kill anyone. So it's either at the top or at the bottom, no inbetween (well, very rarely). When I achieve flow (once or twice a week, max, and I play for 8+ hrs a day), I become unstoppable, reactions, aim, just headshotting people.  
When I want to win and concentrate, I just can't. I think about concentration instead of thinking about the game, and when I try not to think about concentration I notice everything around me, how my monitor stands, my keyboard and the mouse movement. I get more concentrated as I get more kills. I don't want to enter auto-pilot, as my reactions and aim are good then, but I am not thinking strategically. And, again, If I try to concentrate, I end up concentrating on my mouse movement, my sorroundings, instead of my game, or keep concentrating on WANTING to concentrate. It just takes away a lot of plays for me, as I have the skill, just not the right mindset. I've been struggling with this for years."|RandomGuy2611|False|https://redd.it/ekvdh4|1|0.6|0|2|1|gaming

ekrvwu|2020-01-06 09:39:02|Grand Theft Auto 3 and the Case of the Major Plot Hole|"Hello. I'd like to tell you all about the curious case of Grand Theft Auto 3 and the Major Plot Hole.

In GTA3 we're treated to an opening scene where we are on a prison transport. The prison transport is hit by the Colombian cartel allowing an opportunity to escape. While we're watching this unfold we're treated to a radio broadcast discussing the sophistication of the hit - including a cyberattack erasing criminal records from government computers.

Now why did the Colombians hit the transport?

***To kidnap the old Asian gentleman that was on the transport with you and 8-ball.***

Later on we meet up with Donald Love, billionaire and owner of Love Media. He has you retrieve the old Asian gentleman for him only to disappear leaving behind a simple open box. We never see what is in the box, but Claude does, and then he immediately leaves.

***This is possibly the largest major plot hole of any Grand Theft Auto game ever released.***

The entire basis of the game hinges upon this one aspect, it's the entire reason you got busted out of the transport, and it is never explored further. We even get significant portions of backstory for Love in games like Vice City, where he hangs out with Avery Carrington, and in Liberty City Stories, where he ***eats*** Avery Carrington.

***Rockstar has even gone so far as to state that we will never know what happens to Donald Love or the old Asian gentleman.***

This kind of story-abandonment occupies my thoughts sometimes. Why did they abandon it? Why are they adamant about refusing to continue the story? I just don't understand, and I hope that you, too, will find the whole situation as curious as I do.

ektpcc|2020-01-06 12:46:22|Is bhphotovideo(dot)com safe for an oversees purchase of the Nintendo Switch?|"Context: I am from India, Nintendo doesn't have an official presence here and their consoles are only available in the grey market. They offer no warranty either, so if you get the Joy con drift, you're screwed. $300 is a huge sum of money for me or largely any person. The rent for an entire house is $250 at a prime location in the city. 



Amazon and Flipkart sellers are selling the switch for a bloated price tag of ‚Çπ30K ($420) even though it costs ‚Çπ21K ($299) the USA. Even after accounting ‚Çπ2K ($30) for shipping duty and taxes, it is still way too much. And they don't even have any sort of warranty except their 10 day return period. 




In the search for a cheaper alternative, I stumbled upon a website bhphotovideo(dot)com. Apparently it is the go to website for buying photography related equipments in the USA and it has good reviews. Yet I am quite wary about its services in India. They even offer a 3 year seller warranty for an extra ‚Çπ4K ($51). All in all, they are offering a Nintendo Switch V2 at a price tag of ‚Çπ28K ($390) WITH a 3 year warranty and for 24K ($335) without any warranty. Can anyone here vouch for the website?




And also how does the warranty work? I read on their page that they cover manufacturer warranty. The switch already has a 12 month warranty, then would they ship it back to Nintendo for free?"|Volatile_Walker|False|https://redd.it/ektpcc|0|0.5|0|13|1|gaming

ekt31z|2020-01-06 11:46:30|A Plague Tale|"So I know this game has gotten great reviews. I picked it up during the winter sale on steam and I have not yet finished it so NO SPOILERS PLEASE. I will mention spoilersi just don't want anything late game ruined.

I just wanted to give the game some praise. This isn't intended to be a review really just more of a my current thoughts.

So I don't usually play single player games often besides big rpgs like elder scrolls, fallout, Witcher. But I've been trying to give single player a go again since I have free time and no steady internet. And I especially don't play stealth games.

I just got to chapter 15 which I believe is fairly close towards the end and the game has blown me away. Looks stunning in 1080 60fs ultra. One of the best looking games I've played. The aesthetic is also a very nice touch. Have had no real issues running the game and while I feel maybe my laptop is underperforming a little it's never go e below 60 outside of maybe the first mission where shit is gorgeous it dipped to 55 at times for a few seconds but for me not noticable really.

The story of this game has pulled me in. Glorified escort mission lol but it never really feels like that. The mechanics are super simple and there isn't much variety on that side imo but the fact you aren't helpless and can fight back is a big plus for me. I like that you're a one hit kill which shows you really shouldn't engage anyone if you can avoid it. The little sort of boss fights have been fun and the puzzles are mostly not super complicated. However the one in the courtyard of the castle was driving me insane for a half hour lol. Also had a hell of a time escaping the one camp. I'm not a big fan of games that have puzzles but they did it right. Room for error in all of them but mostly straightforward. 

The game feels good in terms of movement and such. I use controller and I'm a big fan of how strong the aim assist is in the game. Besides that there's a fair bit of variety of you do have to fight an enemy. Such as the melting helmets to be able to kill a guard.

The story though is definitely where the game shines. Now the way I know I'm involved in good storytelling is there is foreshadowing that is effective however it doesn't tell you the whole truth. I could kind of figure out the boy would have some sort of special immunity or such with the rats. That being said I wasn't expecting him to have the ability to actually control them and didn't realize as he progresses it's actually a positive in a sense. I figured they wanted him for that however after just completing the mission to rescue your mom and use his ability the story has put me in a real are we the assholes? Type of thing.

At the base of it it seems like wanting the boy is to help cure the bite which is a positive goal. Of course the methods this far are very questionable at best and I've yet to determine if we're wrong for trying to keep Hugo away and slow the Macula. This is what makes a good story to me. No definitive evil imo is present in this game yet. Yes they are doing evil things but then the question pops up again as to whether everything is a necessary sacrifice. On the surface you could argue hiding Hugo is gonna fuck the world over or that the (templars, inquisitions? Can't rember what the enemies are) are doing what is best overall for the world. It honestly has me questioning myself as to whether or not I'm in the wrong. That is good storytelling.

The rats are fucking awesome as well. It's very odd to be impressed but swarms of rats with glowing eyes lol but it's just badass in some way haha.

Also small detail but I liked that when playing as Hugo it's actually a smaller FOV. Makes shit a bit more annoying not being able to easily peak over stuff when sneaking around which makes sense since you're a child.

Sound is very good as well. I like the voice acting and just the overall sound of the rats swarming, lighting lanterns and such.

The game also does a great job withpacing of both story elements and actual gameplay. When I have to fucking book it it legit makes me anxious as shit and gets my heart pumping. When it's slower there's moments that are nice and somber and then others where I'm losing it hiding behind a barrel as a guard walks right by me. It switches it up often enough i don't get bored sneaking all the time. It's a good balance.

Now some cons. Maybe it's just me but I have felt like I maybe get seen a few times when I do not feel like I should have. At the same time the hiding can feel like it's a bit of a gimme where any normal person would notice me. Notably Hugo hiding under desks right next to someone with perfect line of sight of where he is. The game isn't riddled with all of this but it does happen often enough i do notice it. My biggest con would be the fact that the sneaking or puzzles involving light is usually fairly limited in variety. Most puzzles involving light at hardly puzzles at all and more or less just feel like something extra to do before advancing. There are times where it will allow you to find hidden supplies and such that is useful but it is a bit bland in terms of the variety involved with the lights or just sneaking around.

Obviously no game is perfect and you could find flaws with any. But yeah if you aren't just waiting for a guard to walk somewhere so you can go there the only other thing you'd really do is Chuck a rock somewhere to distract a guard or break a lantern. I know it's a stealth game but I feel like it's a little too straight forward in how you approach situations. Doesn't seem like there's many options from point A to B but again that may just be a me thing that i haven't noticed. Also along with that the game is incredibly linear. This is in addition to not much variety in his to approach a lot of situations but the game is very linear with the only time you'd ever really get off track is by finding a section with some supplies. 

Overall I'm liking the game and can't wait to continue and beat it sometime soon. 

Just wanted to shed some more light on this game because I don't see much talk about it. Online it may be just because it came out earlier in 2019 or I'm just not seeing many posts anywhere involving it outside of awards. I know basically all my friends haven't heard about it until I mentioned it to them.

Let me know what you guys felt about the game and again please don't talk about chapter 15 and beyond (right after you use Hugo's power to manipulate rats)

And again this isn't intended as like a full review. I know there's probably a lot of good things I didn't mention and some bad things I haven't experienced or noticed.

Also I definitely recommend you get the game if you were on the fence. I'd likely wait for another sale to come around because it is fairly short I think I read about 10 hours or so for main story. If you really do not like stealth though I'd say maybe pass. I never play any stealth games and I'm loving it but if you are someone who just can't do stealth the game may be hard to get in to."|LovableKyle24|False|https://redd.it/ekt31z|1|1.0|0|0|1|gaming

ekihpp|2020-01-05 20:22:16|I played PS4 for the first time|"I was pretty much a Nintendo guy. I grew up with the Wii, the Wii U, the DS, 3DS. Not to mention the constant exposure to Pokemon and Mario as a Kid through other media. My knowlede in gaming is pretty much comprised of Nintendo characters with a little bit of tekken and sonic mixed in. 

I did have a PSP for a certain period of time which gave me a glimpse of stuff like god of war and GTA and the likes of that. But at that time I was also very much into anime so you can just imagine the type of games I play.

Ayway after years of that, I got myself a ps4 a few days ago. I tried Fallout (i think it was 4?) And spiderman. First thing that got me: I was definitely not expecting the long waiting times from the Loading and Downloading (from what I understood the console does 50/50 with the disc to run the games.)
 I was more used to the ""pop the disc in and start the game"" kinda setup. So in this aspect I prefer its competitor.

I have to say though the visuals (both spiderman and fallout) are amazing. So far I've seen more of the cartoonish styles if not the ps1-ps2 kind of graphics from Nintendo. I am very much aware of the PS' capabilities but still, seeing for myself and interacting with the games themselves is a different experience.

So far the games, or atleast the ones I tried are very ""big"" to the point Where It's a bit overwhelming (and I have played BoTW). The amount of content that goes in these games is incredible. Well I guess the PS and Xbox are known for these so it shouldn't be unexpected.

Anyways that's all I have. If you have any ps4 recommendations let me know but I'll be immersing myself in spiderman for quite a while lol"|Pennarello_BonBon|False|https://redd.it/ekihpp|10|0.75|0|22|1|gaming

Over the past 3 days I completed again for the first time in about 8ish years and it was just as amazing as when I first played it. When I was younger I remember how advanced the games was for it's time and it's crazy how far technology and visuals in gaming have come. 
I'm planning to replay other games from the older consoles, but even just looking through all the games just takes me back to the pleasant experiences I've had with games over the years.

""To live in peace and power until the two thousandth year when we will return for the new chosen and worship once again at the peak of mount shann.""

Then at some point in time possibly mt Shann got renamed and with modern changes for the ski lift altered the appearance slightly but is still the focal point for the alien mystery. Possibly also why now on Mt Chilliad there is a locked door because someone or the gov. found out the secret and trying to hide it?)

ekqj2q|2020-01-06 07:11:13|Why mobile games are bad|"Oh boy. The most accessable corner of gaming also happens to be the worst part of it also. Now before I go on further, this is opinion, which means you can disagree with me also.

Anyways, why are mobile games bad? Well let's take a look.

1. Cloning. Yeah game genres exist, I know not every game has to be exactly different. But here, a ton of games actually do feel the exact same. It's dry and unoriginal. It seriously hinders the experience.

2. Controls. Tapping glass just doesn't feel right to me. It leads to not as good control over the game, so fast paces action games do not work as well. The simpler ones are a bit better though.

3. Shovelware. The cloning aspect kind of applies here. It's the ones like those ""stack"" or ""block break"" games, etc. They just aren't enjoyable, it seems like they were whipped up in a couple of hours. Also this is about 90% of new mobile games as well.

4. False advertising. Oh god I've seen this so many times. You know, the ads that advertise something that looks really cool, but then the actual game looks COMPLETELY different. Game of Sultans and Mafia City are the worst offenders here. I'm also lumping in these ""You can't get past level 3!"" or the ""noob vs pro vs hacker"" ads, they kind of fit in in some ways.

5. (This is the worst part) The fact that almost ALL mobile games are blatant cash grabs. Oh god. Oh dear god. This aspect is the absolute worst. This defines the hellhole that mobile games are in. Intrusive unskippable ads and microtransactions. They are in almost EVERY game and there is no way around them. Games are very grindy and almost force you to spend money. Here's a tip; if you see ""contains ads"" and/or ""in app purchases"", it's probably not worth your time. Skip out on it.

ekjrnz|2020-01-05 22:04:52|Theory: What is the hardest video game?|"Something I've always thought about in the back of mind was the hardest video game ever made. Of course, you could say difficulty is subjective, but many games are made with difficulty in mind. You might immediately think Dark Souls, but there's a series of games that'd make Dark Souls look easy in comparison.

The Kaizo Mario games are infamous for their insane difficulty. They are rom hacks of mainly Super Mario World made to be extremely brutal. It takes the most skilled SMW players hundreds of hours to beat them. A personal favorite of mine is Invictus, it's really fun to watch someone play it live and it has amazing music.

However, I think you could go a little deeper then that. There are SMW hacks which are meant to be even harder then Kaizo, so hard they are impossible for a human to beat. The Item Abuse series makes use of a lot of precise frame perfect inputs and glitches which a human couldn't do. Only a tool assisted speedrun could beat an Item Abuse game, and even then it's apparently very difficult to make a TAS for them. Therefore, I believe the Item Abuse series to be the most difficult, yet still theoretically possible to beat games ever made, as long as you're a robot or are really good at memorizing thousands of frame perfect precise inputs."|ArielMJD|False|https://redd.it/ekjrnz|5|0.86|0|24|1|gaming

If someone is curious about this topic, here are these that I already know about: Neverwinter Nights>!(I think there was an option like this, I played a long time ago)!<, Dark Souls>!(Dual zweihanders for the true chad)!<, Elona+ RPG>!(you can either gene engineer yourself a couple of new limbs or lighten up your heavy OP weapons)!<, Tales of Maj'Eyal>!(Giants have a racial ability that allows them to do that, I wish humans could do that too at some point for RP reasons)!<. Also, The Last Remnant: you have a 4-armed catpeople there to suit all your weeb needs and a thirst of going full Asura on your opponents.

And that's it. 

Let me know if there's more or share your thoughts about **HOW COOL THAT IS**."|The_One_Who_Slays|False|https://redd.it/ekp7dy|0|0.56|0|20|1|gaming

ekp5ji|2020-01-06 04:59:44|Lets compare The Evil Within 1 with Dark Souls (But different)|"I know, you can't hear dark souls-comparisons anymore.

But this comparison is not about the Game, it's about the reception.

Dark Souls 1 is considered as a 'Flawed Masterpiece' (which i agree with).

(Without dsfix, which was made by fans) Terrible frame-rate, terrible controls on PC, some bad bosses, some bad areas. This game has many flaws, but why is it still a Masterpiece for me and so many others? 

Because it makes up for it. Some of the best level design in videogame-history. A cleverly connected World, maybe a bit clunky but super fun and rewarding combat, and a cryptic story which let fans put the pieces togheter.

Now, let's look at the Evil Within 1.

You see much hate about this game. You hear it has flaws. But other than in Dark Souls, people seem to not look through its flaws and Highlight the Good, at least Not as they do in Dark Souls.

A threatining, dirty look, linear but clever level design, the constant fear of traps, fun bosses, good weapon feeling, good sound design, huge variety in terms of Gameplay, not many people will argue that what i just listed is completly false.

But still they hate the game for stuff like 'the trial and error difficulty', bad framerate, glitches, the short amount of time you can run (which i dont consider a flaw btw).

They don't want to look behind its flaws for some reason.

If You hear someone saying he does Not like dark souls it will mostly be because he does Not like rpg's or he does Not like the cruel difficulty and maybe confusing world.

Now lets compare the Situation from the reception of dark souls 2 and the evil within 2.

There's a lot of hate for Dark Souls 2. And i can understand every single point"" even if i still like the game Quite a bit. The stupid idea of a stat that makes the dodge-roll more effective, linear as hell level design, many boring bosses, bad graphics, lame final Boss and ending, unfair enemy ganks.

There is a Lot.

The evil within 2 gets praised for beeing alot better than 1 , and while i also enjoyed it quite a lot, i can't understand it. Kinda empty open world, no more variety in Gameplay, no more clever level design for me most part, clunky combat controls, boring plot, almost no more traps, no more matches, worse bosses, no more dirty and threatining look.

Finally my question: Why is this? As you can see, i do not compare the games, but the Situation. For me, it's quite interessting to look at. Now, discuss guys, that's why we're here!"|TGSYAS|False|https://redd.it/ekp5ji|1|0.6|0|5|1|gaming

ekj9wh|2020-01-05 21:22:47|Sid Meier's Pirates...|Hey there. Just wondering if there's a community for this game. My friend and I are creating a mod for it. Turns out this game from 2004 was made using a modified Gamebryo engine. Currently Bethesda Studios has a Creation tool kit which is sourced from the Gamebryo as well. We're still comparing the source codes but with luck, time, and faith.... We hope to create an updated texture pack + a mod fixing a few major bugs (for example) ---> your ship getting stuck in the land and not being able to move out. Another annoying thing not a bug but a nuisance I'd like to address is after winning a sea battle... The other ship raises the white flag but your ship becomes slow and requires a tedious motion to get close enough to capture. I want to modify this and make it so when the white flag is raised, that is it.... You win the battle and seize the ship or whatever you want to do with it (next animation shows up).... Again just for our fun, but wondering if there's a community for this game still. Not too sure on any rules here, I'm still fairly new and I have not used this in awhile. Apologies. Also not self promoting whatever that means... Oh last thing, might post on steamworks modshop if there's a community for this game. I honestly don't know how that part of steam works but I'm sure my friend or I can figure that part out. Cheers guys.|vancityvlogger|False|https://redd.it/ekj9wh|3|0.7|0|2|1|gaming
ekrbg9|2020-01-06 08:35:47|Why do you have to wait before using online features?|"Hello everyone.
It's a question I don't really know the answer to, and hopefully I'm in the right place to ask it.

Some games prevent you to use certain online features for some time and after this 'some time' has passed you have complete access to the feature.

For example: Rocket League prevents you from trading the in-game paid currency for a week after you buy some, but after a week you can trade it normally.

Some other games prevent you to play online unless you reach a certain level in single-player (such as R6 if I remember correctly).
Some others even only allow you to play online after some days you first try to access the online gameplay.

Now, I read that it's to prevent hacking or stuff like that, but I'm not sure how this discourages cheaters. Does anyone have a better reply to the whole thing?"|Smn42|False|https://redd.it/ekrbg9|0|0.25|0|5|1|gaming
ekhdrk|2020-01-05 19:05:41|Should I give Breath of the Wild another try?|"Well I am apparently the only person on earth who did not like Breath of the Wild. I played it for a few hours, basically enough time to climb a couple towers, enter a couple temples, and wander aimlessly into Kakariko Village. 

My four favorite Zelda games were consecutively released on major systems: Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, and Twilight Princess, in that order. I suppose I enjoyed the accessibility of Wind Waker and when I see people play Breath of the Wild it just seems like a chore. Maybe it's also because I really have an issue with weapons that cannot be repaired. In Morrowind and Fallout games, weapons do degrade with use but they can be repaired. I heard that in BotW even the f'ing Master Sword can become temporarily useless? Eh...

I'm not trying to be edgy or contrarian, I guess maybe I just wasn't going about the game the right way when I first played it. Should I give it another try?

Here are my current specs:

I7-7700 @ 4.00ghz

1060 6gb

16gb ram

I mainly play GTA 5 and RDR2 for the moment.

My cpu hits 100% on Red Dead and my gpu goes to about 68c

On GTA, I have low FPS, just like red dead, but my gpu does not hit 100% and stays at about 50-80% and my gpu stays at about 50c

Personally, I wanted to upgrade my GPU but I fou d that my CPU was staying at a high %. Also, I know these games are open world so most likely more demanding on my CPU."|Solorax|False|https://redd.it/ekjdir|0|0.5|0|11|1|gaming

ekim6o|2020-01-05 20:31:05|I hate Shadow Fight 3|"I hate Shadow Fight 3

Why do I hate Shadow Fight 3? Easy, I came to that game for Shadow Fighting, like in SF2 and didn‚Äôt met the expectations at all. Let‚Äôs start with the animation and CGI, I don‚Äôt like them they look crappy and sloppy, I can‚Äôt get past that animation. Then we have gameplay, it isn‚Äôt enjoyable all that dynamic movement of SF2 disappeared on this game, on the last game I jumped, punched and kicked in a lots of ways but in this game, the jumping seems limited and the character movement doesn‚Äôt gives me the same sensation of SF2. In SF2 I had a reason to do stuff in this one even though I have I don‚Äôt feel it. The powers here doesn‚Äôt helps the game I hate the shadow form. 

The things that I liked are: none

And probably I wouldn‚Äôt be doing this and just didn‚Äôt play the game if it wasn‚Äôt named Shadow Fight 3 but of course that name was just to lure fans from SF2

Edit: The bosses are real worst than SF2 because comparing the first boss of each game we can see that Lynx makes a challenge that you want to beat because you know that he‚Äôs a threat to the world, in SF3 you want to beat him to finished the damn game to finish your suffering, and the intro, in SF2 it really you what you‚Äôre doing, why your doing it and let‚Äôs you know the threat here. But, SF3 you see some random people fighting then you start the game"|1Destro|False|https://redd.it/ekim6o|0|0.55|0|5|1|gaming

ekf2fa|2020-01-05 16:21:59|What Classic PS/PS2 Era game could (mostly hope) we expect to be announced/released this time around?|"Before in the early 2010s it seemed like we had a trend of remakes and remasters. Now as of 2017, it seems like that trend moved onto remastering games from the PS/PS2 era starting with Crash Bandicoot. Then in 2018 we got Spyro. 2019 we saw Crash Team Racing and MediEvil. Maybe Sony and Activision are keen on continuing this trend? Is so, what could we possibly hope to get reworked this time around?

Personally, I wouldnt even know where to begin what to think. And although it doesnt fit the category, Im hoping for a reboot of Jak & Daxter, or continuation of Sly Cooper.
