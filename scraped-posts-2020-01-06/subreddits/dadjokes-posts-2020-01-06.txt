ejvi6d|2020-01-04 11:17:47|A dad story. If you read till the end of this one, I promise you'll hate it.|"

Have I ever told you about the time I nearly died in a plane crash? Well...


One dark and stormy night, our cargo plane was loaded with supermarket goods. But we were in trouble! A freak storm had showed up, and our plane was struggling against the hurricane-force winds.


After a terrifying hour of this, we lost navigational controls. The pilot had descended to 10,000 feet, and was attempting to search for a safe place to make an emergency landing. 


But the plane was no match for the fury of the storm. The aircraft was tossed to and fro and the wind threatened to crumple it like a ball of foil. 


Our fuel was now nearly gone, and the engines were sputtering. As far as we could tell, we were now over some large city. But that was no consolation to us, as we were hurtling to our certain deaths.


The captain announced over the comms that everyone should prepare for the worst...


The morale of the crewmembers had now drastically fallen. Some of us lay crying in a corner, others had passed out from sheer fear or dread, and still others screamed out desperate prayers in their despair.


Everyone, even the captain, had lost hope. Everyone, that is, except for the cargo bay janitor, Steve. Steve just stood there amidst the chaos, rolling with the punches of the relentless wind. As I lay there with my crewmembers, Steve somehow remained standing, and not far off, seemingly without a care in the world.


Suddenly, the wind tore a hole in the cargo bay, and four pallets of frozen meat exploded out of it, scattering over the city below.
I looked on in horror, imagining the huge slabs of meat destroying rooftops, or smashing pets, children, and vehicles.


Steve just watched it all with a smirk. I looked at him, and he, noticing my gaze, turned back with that same wry grin and said:
