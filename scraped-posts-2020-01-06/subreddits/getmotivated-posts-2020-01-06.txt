ekx1ox|2020-01-06 17:16:28|[Discussion] Finding the motivation to do better, especially when failure seems to always throw you off your target. Here's how to leverage Maslow's hierarchy of needs to keep you going.|"Doing some research on motivations and how they relate to our needs and desires, here are some of my conclusions...

Principle: **Hire level goals & desires can influence and override lower level habits & desires.**  
(See Maslow's hierarchy of needs here: [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Maslows-Hierarchy-of-Needs-Pyramid-Gargasz-2010-Love-Belongingness-Needs-once-the\_fig1\_321267309](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Maslows-Hierarchy-of-Needs-Pyramid-Gargasz-2010-Love-Belongingness-Needs-once-the_fig1_321267309))  
If you’re having a hard time making a change a behavior, habit, or desire...

\[1\] look at where it is in the Maslow's needs hierarchy.  
\[2\] meditate on the levels above it, how can they be leveraged to motivate the desired change?  
\[3\] define what goals in the higher levels of needs override the needs in the lower levels.  
\[4\] work continually to move your personal desires to higher and higher levels.  
\[5\] resolve conflicts at lower levels that do not support your higher-level goals.

This works for both curbing desires/habits you consider to be negative and also helping to support desire/habits you wish you could better implement and stick to in your life.

**Curbing desires/habits example...**

Let's say you're unhappy with your personal relationships. Maybe you're single and have exciting flings that lead nowhere and fizzle out after 'the rose glasses' fade, or are addicted to porn, or simply don't feel deeply connected with your friends.

So you're looking to 'clean up' the third tier in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

✅ **Looking up the pyramid...** What goals can you set that relate to 'self-actualization' & 'esteem needs'?

Esteem Goal: Determine to be 'more interesting' by allocating time to learn new things you can share with others you wish to connect with; both in discussions & in activities. Maybe try 1 new hobby per month and invite someone to learn it with you. Maybe find an interesting book and ask someone to read it as well so you can discuss it. Maybe commit to only being intimate with someone who you feel an emotional connection with vs. just an exciting connection with.

On the 'Self Actualization' level... consider what values, when you've applied them regularly, actually give you fulfillment. Do you feel more empowered when you demonstrate 'self-control'? Then commit to doing your utmost to demonstrate that value in your life (a very good reason to perhaps quit porn). The confidence that self-control gives you will do wonders for your confidence around other people and is an attribute that they will find attractive. Can you look to your goal to demonstrate self-control in your life to help motivate you when you fail, or when you feel overwhelmed? Of course, you can.

✅ **Looking down the pyramid...** What basic needs do you need to address that are lacking in your life to help support your higher-level goals?

Now that you've meditated on the higher levels and set some goals now look down the pyramid and consider these aspects in your life.

Are you consistently stressed by a lack of security (income, overspending, lack of a budget)? This stress can lead you to self medicate with 'pleasure now' activities that stress relationships and don't foster good relationships.

What actions can you take to help address these stresses? -- New job? Better budget? Simplify your living arrangements?

The higher-level goals you've set will help you to stay motivated to change these lower-level habits as well.

\--- end example ---

Another important aspect is addressing your relationship with failure. You will fail regularly, but that is part of the process, and your reaction to it will improve overtime as you practice reframing your reactions to it.

The more you fail, the easier it will get to bounce back from the failure.

Understanding that your default reaction to failure will very likely be negative, especially in the beginning, but understand this: this reaction is a defense mechanism, not reality. Your brain is trying to protect you from feeling bad, but in turn is making you feel bad... it's a tough thing to battle. You need to, with practice, demonstrate to your brain that the changes you're making are actually good. The only way to do that is to summon your rational thought in moments of failure - telling yourself that this is a natural part of the process, and reminding yourself that the pain will soon pass; that the failure is something that happened, it is not who you are.

\-- Ok that's just some morning pondering, I know this isn't incredibly sourced and isn't designed to be a research paper... I'm happy to modify based on any suggestions in the comments or clarify elements if they seem to be too convoluted. Hope this gives some practical steps for those looking for them.

**To answer an FAQ I'm sure will come up:** *how do I get started if I have no motivation to even think about this stuff? --* My answer? **Go to therapy**, but do so with the end goal of starting the process, not just to treat symptoms. This is often the first step for individuals who have no life experience with starting, well, anything. **Sometimes you need someone to help lift your leg for the first step if all you've done your whole life is lay on the ground.**"|ironicart|False|https://redd.it/ekx1ox|6|0.84|0|0|1|getmotivated

ekt244|2020-01-06 11:43:48|[Discussion] How to figure out what you actually want from life?|"Hello, this is my first thread on reddit ever so I hope this is ok! I feel like this generally fits the rest of the subreddit but please delete/let me know if not.

Basically, I have a lot of the issues that people on here post about - procrastination, lack of productivity, feeling lazy when you want so hard to accomplish something, etc. Some of the advice has been great and has helped with getting certain mundane tasks done, but a lot of the more general advice about living your life in a productive way and working towards your goals is really hard for me to follow because....... I don't know what I want. When someone says 'just do one thing towards your big goal/project every day', it's less that I lack the motivation to work towards it and more that I'm generally aimless and having nothing to give me motivation in the first place.

I don't know what I want from life. When I try to picture an ideal future situation/self, I come up blank. I can't imagine what long-term scenario will make me happy or how I would spend my days if money were no object.  My life feels so empty but I don't have any particular passion to pursue. I'm 27F, in a job I don't hate but don't love and have no interest in going further on this career path, living with my parents while I save enough to move out. Don't get me wrong, I have a loving family, great friends (though we all live kinda far apart) and I have a LOT of hobbies. I draw, I write, I play video games, I like photography and baking, I've dabbled in things like archery and playing instruments. But I don't do any of those things particularly well and I don't know if I can envision making any of them my career. I tend to cycle through each one every few months.

I do have a couple of mental health problems like anxiety and ADHD (and depression for a few years, though I think I'm pretty much out of the woods with that now), so I wonder if maybe I just lost all sense of what makes me happy while I was busy dealing with all that all these years.

Btw , I feel like I should point out that I'm fully aware no one can tell me what I want! Only I can figure that out. But I would be interested to know if anyone else here has experienced anything similar and if you eventually figured out what you wanted from life, particularly if you made any conscious steps to do so.

Thank you guys so much."|magelaw|False|https://redd.it/ekt244|5|0.9|0|3|1|getmotivated

Some people will make the mistake of seeing obstacles as problems.

By doing so, these people will leave with a significant handicap in their state of mind.

In the end, they will not be able to overcome the obstacle in question and will not be able to move forward in life.

Successful people always choose to see problems as opportunities.

This is because other people may have the same problem as you do and the same difficulties in overcoming certain obstacles, so this is an opportunity for you.

You can address this problem and help other people if you can overcome this obstacle and turn it into an opportunity at the same time.

Do you know why Jeff Bezos created Amazon?

Simply because he couldn't find an online bookstore at the beginning of the Internet.

So he decided to respond to this problem with a solution.

The problem became an opportunity and he executed perfectly to achieve immense success with Amazon.

ejhp5p|2020-01-03 16:25:56|[Tool] I created a free reminder app where you can motivate yourself using your own recorded motivational notifications or alarms! (Includes location based reminders!)|"Hello everyone! Like a lot of people here I struggle with waking up and having the motivation to get out of bed or to go to the gym a minimum of 3 days a week. I am also super forgetful and constantly use reminders on my phone.

I developed the app [Voice Reminder - Recordable Notification and Alarm](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.customtodoreminder.customtodoremindernotificationandalarm) since I wanted a reminder app that could do more than just the simple default ringtone you hear when a notification goes off. That sound could be for anything and you still have to check your phone. My app will let you know immediately what the reminder is even if you don't have your phone in your hands.

What makes my app unique is the ability to record your own notification or alarm. So instead of the normal system sounds, you can remind yourself using anything you want or say! Of course you can still select from the system's default ringtones if you want. 

Instead of waking up to the same boring alarm sound, why not wake up to a recording of yourself yelling, ""WAKE UP YOU FILTHY ANIMAL, POUND DOWN THAT COFFEE, AND JUMP INTO A COLD SHOWER! Sounds a lot better and more motivating than just a ding right? Now replace your typical reminder ding to hit the gym with the meme ""JUST DO IT!"" Whatever else you need motivation in, just meme yourself into productivity!

I also recently added location based reminders. Now you can set a reminder to go off once you enter a store. You walk in, and instead of the typical ""ding"" you now here ""Don't forget to grab milk!"" Or arriving home you hear a recording of yourself saying, ""Bring the trash bins in from the road!""

Hopefully some of you can find it productive to use in lieu of a regular reminder system. E.g. taking out the trash, taking medication, shopping, cleaning the house, waking up or working out, homework/studying, walking the dog, all with a personalized reminder. I hope it can help organize and motivate your life and keep reminders more personal at the same time!

Just  the fact that I'm writing about my problems here, give me a bit of  anxiety, it took me a long time till i decided to write here on Reddit,  and its not because something changed, is just that i cant cope any more  with my situation.

In the most  crucial moments of my life, i had people that were close to me dying,  and i think over time, i start losing interest in my goals and i stop  cultivating myself to a degree where the only way i felt good was by  playing games over and over, that was my escape from reality for a  really long time my childhood included.I went to college,i still am, but  i have been here for 7 years and i did almost nothing, games helped me  go trough the day without having to worry to fix my problems.

I  only had one gf in my life and that was 10 years ago, my low  self-esteem is kicking harder and harder, my depression is rock bottom. Making friends seems hard to me now, but female friends is another  story, since i left school i dont remember having a female friend, i  just don't know how to, i try to behave with them as i do with my  friends but for some reason i scare them away, that's when i have that  voice in my head called low self-esteem saying that im too ugly and unworthy for them to like me, deep down i know they can see through my  insecurities but there is nothing i can do.

3 months ago i finally stop enjoying playing games and all my problems  came to ground, since then i have been trying to meet people online, i  did meet a wonderful smart woman who i started to develop some interest,  the thing is, she is working and she has a stable life and im ashamed  of still being dependent of my parents and still have a college degree  to complete from scratch, but we kept talking 4 or 5 hours per day till we start developing feelings, for one week we shared how much we like each other but i felt something was wrong she was not sharing something with me, after a couple of days insisting she told me she cant be with me because she is married and im till today depressed, i don't know how to handle this situation any more, she says she loves me but don't know what to do, and i wonder if this is honesty or manipulation

I  cant find any motivation to learn new things, study, be more social or  chase my goals.One week ago i did my first step and went to my college  psychiatry because its free but, she only asked me questions, it was me  talking the whole time, i don't know if its suppose to be like that but i  don't feel any improvement at all,  the only thing that i  realized was  how big my problems actually are but i see no light in the end of the  tunnel.

The only thing that helps  me through the day is reading motivational e-books and read about  psychology, it helps me have a better sense of me and raise my awareness  to deal with life the best and most comfortable way i can, but one  thing is understanding the concept and another is apply it in real life,  i don't have money to go out, my money is just for college and food and  some occasionally coffees with friends, the few i still have because  most of them next year will finish college and i will find myself alone.

I  hate that i waste so many time of my life playing games instead of  fixing my problems, i hate that i no longer feel motivated to learn  stuff and i can see how that  harmed my social interactions because most  of times im the guy who only listen and i feel like i have nothing to  say hence, i feel im dumb as hell i lost my ability to engage in smart  conversations because i know nothing about the topic and people just  loss interest in me.

ejglwp|2020-01-03 15:08:25|How Do I Balance Staying Positive with Being Terrified? [Discussion]|"33 y/o (F) American here. (Also I hope I’m in the right place because I didn’t see a more fitting subreddit to go to with this.)

I’ve always been a pretty serious, depressed person. I have a bad habit of overthinking, becoming anxious, and generally only seeing the negative side of things. I have strong emotions and have found that a lot of times they are not warranted for what’s going on. 

I’ve taken many baby steps to better myself and outlook- I went to counseling, started habits to maintain better quality of life, etc. Over the past 5 years I’d say I’ve made great strides in becoming a more mentally healthy person and seeing more good in my life and in the world. 

It’s a bit confusing though, because sometimes I question if my emotions and worries are ever really warranted. Which brings me to the “terrified” part. 

I hear about something horrible someone has done at least twice a week- you know, something jaw-droppingly bad. It might be a court ruling, a mass shooting, a tweet from my President, or seeing a general uprising of white supremacy thinking, etc.  

I keep up with news and am constantly seeing stubbornness to change things for our environment, or that yet another part of the world has caught on fire and has been on fire for weeks, or that we could possibly be going to war (again). 

I want to continue being a positive person, but I literally don’t understand how- my intense emotions of helplessness and hopelessness surrounding these issues are just too much. 

I understand that as an American I am most certainly being more self-centered. There’s a lot more going on in the world than I could ever realize. 

But how am I supposed to attempt to live a “normal” life with all these horrible things going on? I don’t want to be Chicken Little here, but at what point should I be outraged/terrified that the world is in this state and I feel like I literally cannot affect it positively at all? All I see is dangerous people in power, people living in fear, and the planet pretty much exploding into flames everywhere. 

Sorry for being long-winded. I hope that all made sense."|irishrose86|False|https://redd.it/ejglwp|9|0.72|0|7|1|getmotivated
ejezu2|2020-01-03 12:49:58|[Text] How I stay self-motivated|Hi everyone, this seems an appropriate place to share this. I often get asked by friends, family, clients how I manage to stay motivated despite everything (everything being what we all go through on a regular basis). I get a lot of projects done, pretty proficient on many hobby interests, I finished my degree on time with 3 jobs and all the standard drama you get in college, I work and keep focused even when I'm depressed, I started a business, and I kick my own butt in gear on personal health goals - just to give myself a little credibility. I spent last year thinking about this and put my musings into a blog post. I like to write so that's mostly why I do these but if it can be helpful to people at the same time then great. Last time I wrote about social anxiety, I had people reach out to me for months telling me how much the post helped them. This blog post is a bit long though. I tried to get it down shorter but it's a topic that kinda needs deeper investigation to make any sense. Tldr; Find the Why.

ej4pej|2020-01-02 21:35:09|Truth [Text]|"It’s always where you aren’t looking. I’ve found that to be true for many things in life. Grandpa would ‘hide my nose’ when I was a child. Turns out, it was never between his thumb and wrinkled forefinger. It was right there on my concerned little face, the whole time. 

We often look for the truth in very illogical places. At the bottom of a glass, inside the moral ambiguity and agenda of religious and political leaders; or within the unconditional loving gaze of our mother’s biased eyes. One day I forced myself to take a long, hard look into ‘the mirror which flatters not’. Therein the truth reluctantly revealed itself to me. 

At times what I saw was gritty and unpolished. Despite the reality of this rough appraisal, I needed it to witness an unfiltered self-portrait. It was the only way to improve and progress past my own narcissism. Ego, pride, and personal denial try to convince us that our character flaws are somehow a positive attribute.

Negative personality traits defend themselves from valid criticism like a festering wound which doesn’t want to heal. They take evasive measures to insulate themselves. I decided it was time to strip back the shiny, saccharine veneer of denial and gaze upon the flawed, impure essence of who I really am. 

The thing is, there’s always a struggle to maintain the status quo. Two steps toward truth, followed by three hard-won steps backward. The pattern is as relentless, as it is predictable. Our ego doesn’t like to yield ground or lose but it’s a worthy battle to fight because it is the undeniable ‘arch enemy’ of truth. 

Wear the truth like a badge of honor. Never polish it with flattery or self-deceit. Recognize it’s true essence. The luster you see will set you free."|OpinionatedIMO|False|https://redd.it/ej4pej|9|0.87|0|4|1|getmotivated

1. Be Strong But Not Rude
2. Be Humble But Not Timid
3. Be Brave But Not Reckless
4. Be Proud But Not Arrogant
5. Be Kind But Not Weak

eikf4n|2020-01-01 16:51:59|[Discussion] 2020 Another day or A New Beginning? - You Choose|"2020 Might be a year to set new goals, resolutions and whatnot - but for some it's just another typical day.  It's all about choosing the right goal, saying your going to lose 100 pounds, read 20 books or exercise 4 times a week - you'll start to feel too overwhelmed if you haven't done the first steps. It's about progress - small steps, not huge leaps.

Two things, quick tips:

**Fighting Procrastination**

The dreaded monster inside of us which we can't seem to control.

Tips

* Focusing on completing tasks rather than postponing them to better take advantage of your free time. 
* Spend some of your free time on activities that guarantee value and personal growth 
* Identify your Bermuda triangle (3 social media accounts you spend most time on) to understand how your time is spent. 
* Make a simple To-Do-List to track your various tasks, to avoid forgetting and accumulating unexpected work – as well as completing them one by one. 
* If things still aren’t going as well as they might, make a schedule to properly manage your time and keep yourself structured and organised. 
* Distinguish and separate when you use time for work, free time & free time with added value and growth. 
* Use some free time to produce (create anything that's completely your own: a paper, a video, an audio, painting...) rather than consume. 
* Find a passion to develop and don’t worry if it changes overtime.

**Setting and achieving your Goal**

We are lost, we don't have any clear goal or set unrealistic goals with little to no tangible progress

Tips

* Write your goal on a piece of paper to begin to visualize it.
* Take action and complete small tasks, mastering one and continuing to the next. 
* Be consistent and make it a habit, over time – results will appear. 
* Practice mindfulness (being in the present) for stress reduction, happiness and a clear state of mind. 
* Don’t run after money. When you create value, money will eventually come.  
* Build your foundation from bottom to top, with solid blocks representing small, smart steps. 
* Invest in yourself and influence others. 

Don't worry about completing each and every point, start with a few and start progressing. Imagine your goal being reaching the top of a building, with each staircase representing progress and each step being obstacles or hurdles. The essential thing and only thing you need to do **is to not remain stagnant** going left and right within the same step, but progress step by step reaching your goal.

eiidpb|2020-01-01 13:34:05|Peter Sagal - Do It Anyway [Story]|" 

From his twitter, [Peter Sagal](https://twitter.com/petersagal):

I was moping about thinking about everything I haven't accomplished this last decade -- it's my nature -- when I suddenly thought of something I did in 2010 that I no longer do -- wander into my office alone, open up the laptop, and type the word HELP into the search box.

In August of that year, I was hit by a car and was laid up for a few weeks. Like a lot of people with near-death experiences, I thought about changing my life: because I didn't want the situation I was in to be the only thing I knew until the day when I would know nothing.

Changing it was terrifying, and I was afraid by doing so, I would lose everything. So I put it off for a few years. But things continued to be unbearable, and I decided to take the risk: things were so terrible, how could they get worse? I took a breath and then the plunge.

Things got worse. Much, much worse. Worse in ways I still can't quite believe.

And then, they got better. Or I should say: ""things"" didn't get better. Those things, they stayed terrible. New things, though, arose. When something is destroyed, space is created for something else, something new to grow.

So this is my New Year's message for those who will be starting this decade the way I started the last one: trapped, unhappy, typing in ""HELP"" into search bars, terrified that attempting to make a change will bring with it strife and misery and loss. It probably will.

Do it anyway."|wake3d|False|https://redd.it/eiidpb|8|0.91|0|4|1|getmotivated

eibj3s|2020-01-01 00:41:29|[Text] I have had so much input from books, podcasts and forums like these, I thought I´d summarise what I took away from all of it. I read it every now and again, and it has helped me in 2019, maybe it can be helpful for someone else in 2020. Happy new decade!|"I will be ok.  	

I don´t need to know what the future holds  

there is no certainty, and chasing after it is a waste of energy  

I will be fine. Life will be better one day  

live day by day, one step after another  

travel on your journey, this is YOUR life  

You are o.k., you will continue to be o.k.  

Be present.  

don´t be afraid to make decisions, you will be fine either way  

Work for your goals, but detach yourself from the outcome  

and from the things you can´t control  

You will find love or love will find you  

You will be able to unfold your potential one day  

Continue walking your path, stay steady  

Life will not always be a daily fight for survival  

it WILL get better, but worrying has never changed anything, at least not for the better.  

Surround yourself with your friends, make an effort.  

You might be more welcome than you think  

If someone doesn´t treat you right, move on.  

You don´t have to put up with shitty behavior in order not to be alone. You won´t be.  

Just do you  

If you stay on your path, the right people will cross.  

Some will wave and smile, some will point you in the right direction when you lose your orientation, 

some will share their resources with you to keep you going. Some will walk with you,   

for a while, then go in another direction.  

That´s fine. You cannot join them on their path any more than they can continue with you.   

And already someone new will come along.   

And some people will walk parallel to you. some will stay.  

But remember that you will never walk alone.  

And you might discover that you carry a lot of stuff with you  

Get rid of the things that weigh you down,

and outdated maps.

Be prepared to leave things behind that you never thought you would part with, and you struggle to let go.  

But you have to  

Create space for the things that nourish you,   

and the things you have got to give.  

Go steady, take pause if you have to. Take in the view  

and don´t waste your time worrying what's behind this hill or that horizon.   

It does not matter.  

This is your path.  

It is made for you.  

And because it is yours, there won´t be any obstacles that you can´t overcome.  

Some will take time, some effort, but it will work out and you will be fine  

and there are beautiful things ahead, and sometimes the travel will feel easy,  

you will have a spring in your step, and you will enjoy it.  

And you will be okay in the end  

I promise. You will be fine."|Nafur|False|https://redd.it/eibj3s|32|0.98|0|4|1|getmotivated

eikwp8|2020-01-01 17:30:09|[Discussion] How Do I Motivate Myself To Create Content When I Get Demotivated By Getting Low Exposure/Traffice To It...?|"So as the topic title says.

I feel like I have a LOT to offer to the world amongst a VARIETY of different topics. And I DO offer it to those in and around me in person, for example my friends, family, the clients that come into my gym etc etc.

Despite having the ability to make EVEN BETTER and more fantastic content, with preparation, I tend to either put if off or just don't make as much as I should because I don't know how or where to post to get traffic and find the folks that would be interested and/or looking for my content. This ends up making me NOT wanting to create content in the first place because of the 'oh if no one watches it why should I bother putting in SO much effort?'

I already know that this line of thinking is faulty, I mean if I don't even create the content how can I even POSSIBLY expect to get more exposure at some point in time down the line when let's say a certain single topic or video goes Viral, and then brings in a LOT more traffic that I could hop off of since I would have other QUALITY content already created and ready for consumption.


I guess my getting demotivated occurs because of not knowing the easiest, smoothest least time detracting (from creating content) ways of getting traffic to my Youtube/Instagram/Blog etc.

Has anyone ever been in a situation similar to mine and knows how to address/fix it by any chance?

Here are some of my links so maybe someone can take a quick look over them and let me know where and how I could optimize my traffic for the same.

ehpmhn|2019-12-30 18:11:44|[Story] I Wish You Enough|"\*Adapted from Paulo Coelho's blog\*

Recently I overheard a father and daughter in their last moments together at the airport. They had announced the departure.  
Standing near the security gate, they hugged and the father said, ‘I love you, and I wish you enough.’

They kissed and the daughter left. The father walked over to the window where I was seated. I tried not to intrude on his privacy, but I could not refrain from asking:  
‘When you were saying good-bye, I heard you say, ‘I wish you enough.’ May I ask what that means?’

He began to smile. ‘That’s a wish that has been handed down from other generations. My parents used to say it to everyone.’  
He paused a moment and looked up as if trying to remember it in detail, and he smiled even more.  
‘When we said, ‘I wish you enough,’ we were wanting the other person to have a life filled with just enough good things to sustain them.’  
Then turning toward me, he shared the following as if he were reciting it from memory.

I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright no matter how gray the day may appear.

I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun even more..

I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive and everlasting.

I wish you enough pain so that even the smallest of joys in life may appear bigger.

I wish you enough gain to satisfy your wanting…  
I wish you enough loss to appreciate all that you possess.

I wish you enough hellos to get you through the final good- bye."|RicePaddyFarmer69|False|https://redd.it/ehpmhn|30|0.92|0|8|1|getmotivated

&#x200B;

We both know exactly what will happen, don't we? We have both been down this road before.

Sure, you will go to the gym for the first few days, you'll spend an entire day without eating junk food. You may even start using that meditation app.

But how long will this last?

You will miss a day, or you will be imperfect on another one, and then, slowly, the same old bad habits will start creeping in.

Same old excuses, same old justifications, the same old sensation of feeling like a failure.

&#x200B;

January 1st, 2020 is an arbitrary day; there is nothing special about it. But there is a day that is actually much better & more special:

It's called 'today'.

Today is all you have. The future doesn't exist. The only thing that you will experience through your entire life is this present moment. And your entire future depends on what you do right now.

Now, today, right here, with only what you have.

&#x200B;

Start very, very small, but keep it going. Just don't quit! A consistent yet imperfect workout session is better than any perfect yet inconsistent one.

You don't have to get jacked in 3 weeks. Just take a long walk. Meditate for 30 seconds. Read just one paragraph. Just be 1% better than yesterday.

&#x200B;

If you want your future to be better, but you don't change how you act in the present moment, you, my friend, are a fool.

ehdj3n|2019-12-29 23:36:23|[Discussion] When Your Find Your Purpose, You Take Care Of Motivation. But Things Always Get In The Way|"Hey all, this is my first post here so I hope that I'm doing this right. So i'm just like every one else who is trying to figure out if they are depressed, insane or insecure. Maybe insane was to powerful to say. But I do feel as though insecure I can resonate with. I've never been this way. A bit about me. I'm a cyclist by heart and passion. For work I'm a videographer and digital creative guy. I've had my run in the insecure department for around 3 years now. How did I get this way? I think it was when I found out that my ex girlfriend cheated on me. I was devastated. I wont get all into that but for 2 years after that happened I was single and by myself. Lot's has happened between those 2 years. I went on a road trip by myself, I started a cycling YouTube channel, and then I met the girl of my dreams. I felt like I redefined myself and became a new person during this time since I have experienced so much during that 2 years by myself.

Then my girlfriend and I began kicking it and then I found myself getting even more insecure with situations. I began to view her in a negative light living in fear that she will cheat on me like my previous girlfriend did. It really screwed me up because I realized that I wasn't present in the moment. My girlfriend would always assure me that I was ok and that I have nothing to worry about. She told me I was the best thing that ever happened to her. But I was still inside my head. I would get weird when she went away with her girlfriends on vacations, work trips etc. It was bad.

Outside of this I wasn't performing YouTube videos anymore, I got bigger and put on more weight at the gym thinking that this will disguise who and what I was really feeling inside. Then just a few weeks ago I stoped my cycling. It felt so weird as I was just letting go and felt completely unmotivated.

I then realized that happiness is just a choice in the moment. And you can decide if you want to feel negative thoughts or positive ones. I got my road bike back and cleaned it up. I went for a bike ride last weekend and this weekend full throttle. I then decided to film a YouTube video for my channel and thought about getting back into racing when the season starts. I began eating healthier foods, and bought some of my favorite fruit organic from whole foods which are papaya, pineapple, bananas. I know that I am no where near insane but struggle still with negative thoughts that something bad may happen. And what you entertain that idea, it will happen.

I'm not sure if this may provide value for some people. But I still have a lot to work on. I think that when you find your purpose in life, you take care of motivation. And when you're not motivated on that purpose it's most likely due to distractions. This year 2020 and forward I decided to be razor focus on my passions and continue to shoe unconditional love to people. Also to get fitter, faster and stronger inside and out. I also want to take a break from reddit and social media to recite my problems. I know this is a long post, I hope someone finds good in all this.

eh1zrv|2019-12-29 05:17:30|[Text] Was watching a strong-man competition on the tv in between serving tables at work and it taught a valuable life lesson|"These men were buff, I'm talkin The height of human strength. The didn't ""look"" muscular, and they didn't have to because they were doing incredible feats. 

There was one in particular where this man was pulling a double decker bus down a short track, trying to get the fastest time from point A to point B. It was incredible to watch, watching his facial expressions, his muscles and body tense and shake, shouting and turning red as he pulled this huge piece of metal behind him. He made his mark in roughly 30-some seconds and When he reached the finish line, he collapsed exhausted and barely able to move.

Here I am blown away at this man's physical abilities to be able to tow something behind himself that was never meant to be carried by a human being,

But...

Arnt we all in a sense towing something behind us? that was and is not somthing meant to be carried, not in a physical way, but in a mental or emotional one? What is your symbolic double decker bus your carrying behind you at this moment?

See, the thing is, success wasnt measured on whether he collapsed from the amount of effort it took to fight. They all did that. What was measured was ""how far can he carry this without giving up, in a better time than the last competitor""? 

Your success isn't measured on whether you collapse or fall into exhaustion, like for example into redoing a habbit or addiction that you are attempting to quit. Your success isn't even defined if you grow tired and give up for a short while emotionally or mentally in life. Your success is measured, like this strong-man with his physical strength by how far he carried it, by instead in a mental or emotional way of how far you carry *your* burden.

Note another point,
There is no other contestants in this personal contest, no one else to compare your success or fall with. The only person you are competing against is yourself, and who you were the previous day. Not who you want to be, not who you are, *but who you were.* Each new day is like another opportunity to beat your best or worst attempt. ""The last guy"" so to speak.

You do not fail or am deemed successful based on your finishing or collapsing, but by your endurance in carrying this struggle behind you. 

Regardless if it is the size of a double decker bus. Regardless if like this man who won first place because of his resolve, even though collapsing of exhaustion after only 30-some seconds later (and he was in peak physical condition!) And Like these strongmen, just because you don't have the appearance of strength..doesn't mean you are not strong.

Be kind to yourself emotionally but tough enough to motivate yourself to keep on pushing forward, and continue to struggle. It means you are succeeding. If it's easy or not difficult...well, that could mean your just not pulling yet, or not at all. Keep on enduring. You won't realize you crossed the finish line until you get there, and what a personal joyful moment that will be.

When it came to stories about the success of Steve Jobs, Elon Musk or Bill Gates, you thought that was normal because they were extraordinary people and you didn’t try to follow their example.

For the stories of these people, it’s different. You see that these people are normal just like you are. Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that they are like you, they have achieved significant success. So you begin to think that you, in turn, can achieve similar success.

Often you see only the tip of the iceberg. In fact, you only see these people at the top of the mountain. You want to reach the top of the mountain in your own domain but you forget how far these people have come to reach the top of the mountain.

So you make the mistake of focusing only on the results and forgetting the whole process of achieving incredible results.

Personally, I think that above all you need to focus on the process rather than the results as I explain in detail here:  [**https://medium.com/@ssaurel/stop-focusing-on-the-mountain-top-and-start-enjoying-your-climb-15cbec584d2e**](https://medium.com/@ssaurel/stop-focusing-on-the-mountain-top-and-start-enjoying-your-climb-15cbec584d2e) 

The process or ascent to stay in the metaphor of the ascent of a mountain is controllable while the results are not.

Focusing only on results will never allow you to be truly fulfilled in life for me.

I love games. I love random number generation. I also view myself as a person who has a rather strong self-discipline, in general. So, as long as I have a clear goal,  a good chunk of gamification and rewards interesting enough, I can try to reach whatever is on my mind.  
These are the main reasons why Habitica works on me.

I have also learned that what comes to new habits, you should:  
1. start with way too easy and 2. raise the goal little by little.  
Let's take an example. Run 5K. It would go something like this: On day one you put your clothes on. On day 2 you walk out the door and back in. On day 3 you walk to the nearest lamp post. On day 4 you walk a little further; say, 10 meters more. Then, slowly, you add more meters. When you start jogging at some point, remember to bring down the meters to 10-100. Then raise meters slowly up, drop them again when you start to run and so on.  
With this method I have gained at least two new habits.

I found out about Habitica years ago. Started to use it right away. At some point I got bored with it so I reset it and had a long break. I don't remember, what benefits I got back then.

&#x200B;

But now I'm back in business. And so far, I have had lots of benefits.

1. Thanks to Habitica, I have lessened sweets.  
Can you imagine - I have sweets as my rewards in there, and it's the reward I have used the most, and still I have managed to lessen it!

2. I have eaten a bit more healthy.  
Food is the biggest challenge of my life. I don't have the energy and discipline on that. Cooking is the necessary evil for me, and I still fight with it. I don't cook much - in fact, my girlfriend has been doing the cooking, and I have dealt with cleaning. Buuut she's probably about to break up with me, so that'll be a bigger fight for me, if that happens.  
So, all in all, with Habitica, I have still managed to have a (somewhat) decent main course, almost every day, and I have also eaten (the minimum amount of) vegetables  and/or fruits almost every day.

3. I have exercised more.  
I like skipping rope. I like cardio. It gives good stuff to almost the whole body. It trains muscles, does good to bones, circulation, lungs. I have jumped about 70 times every day.  
I have also started to do bodyweight exercises.

4. I have started meditating.  
This is more of a contribute of Kurzgesagt, Headspace and Habitica. Many things I love and feel important about had given me the space needed for it. Now I meditate 3-10 minutes per day, every day.  
(My current \[first\] run streak is 23 days, and I have meditated a total of 3 hours, with the average duration of 7 minutes.)

5. I have slept longer.  
I didn't have big problems with sleep anyway (6-8 hours), but now I tend to sleep 8-8,5 hours every night.

6. I have brought Habitica to strengthen my habit of staying away from the computer.  
I love hanging at the computer. It's my favourite - and almost the only - hobby. I may easily sit the whole day at the computer if I have no school or work. With Habitica and the knowledge of making a new habit I have lessened my computer time with one more minute each week. So far I am at 42 minutes. This gives me so much more time to do things I usually wouldn't do otherwise (like cleaning and meditating)!

7. I have spent much more time on cleaning.  
I had a lot of fights with my girlfriend about this. At long last I found a solution and created a cleaning list among my other Dailies. She has whined much less now.  
Win-Win!

8. I have gotten to do most of my Dailies, almost every day  
Thanks to the power of randomness, I get to throw a die each time there are two or less Dailies left to be done before the day changes. The die brings some random flavour to my days, being it more coins, more meditation I need to do or some health I lose.

&#x200B;

These are the biggest changes I came up with now.

&#x200B;

So. Be it games, a list to show you the things you need to do, some powerful music (I use this too! I listen only to the best music when I clean!), getting a massage from your partner, eating sweets, watching a good show on the TV - think about what you are good at, what rewards you, what hobbies you like to do the most and what you need to do, and eventually you might find your own cheat codes to your life, to make things work out much easier!

The biggest difference I've made was to surround myself with people whom I admired and looked up to. When all your friends and acquaintances are motivated and driven, it's hard not to be yourself. I've heard this explained as ""you're the average of everyone around you"".

Not gonna lie I have had a lot of setbacks recently. Family members in hospital, relationships failed, efforts for naught. But I still don't want to give up. I think in the rest of my alloted timespan I still can do at least some of what I want to do. (like publish all the books I wrote!) Most of my friends have had the idealism beaten out of them by life but I'm still a foolish dreamer...in some respects.

But I'm sure as you know some days are easier/harder than others.

What keeps you going? I hope we can support each other. I've read all the inspirational stuff like today's failure is tomorrow's success, you can only join the dots looking backwards etc. I guess I have to just trust at this point? My therapist would tell me that my intellect is looking for evidence, but you can't 100% know the future.

Or maybe I'm just being impatient and I just gotta keep working the plan day by day. Sorry for rambling lol.

But I still live in hope. Great things have happened to me out of nowhere before. (bad things too but hey that's life right) Maybe this post will inspire someone!

efqnza|2019-12-26 04:17:42|[Discussion] I need a light and motivation|"I have posted earlier today about loosing my first love. I lost her once already, before last summer (last day of june). It was the saddest month of my life, I couldn't sleep at all. All my hobbies suddenly turned into the most saddest activities. But thankfully I went to Erasmus to different country, and people there made my head completely busy for 24/7. I have travelled a lot, met new people. Tried to do anything to keep me not thinking about her.


When I have returned, she was trying to contact me, we met and I was kinda over with it, despite knowing that deeply I still love her and wanna be with her. We both cried at her place, where I was saying no to another attempt as she will do it again, that she will leave me once again and I will be saddest person. For the next 3 months, we were chatting, meeting, talking, and it looked like she really is into it this time. She is the girl who never fight for anything and rather quits. So I started to believe it again.
For a while it looked like it could work, however things happened. I organised nice dinner, wanted to surprise her with roses and simply make it a nice day. She has canceled this when I was on the way to pick her up. For the very next day she didn't wanna meet me as well. She said that she doesn't feel like meeting and blocked my number.

List everything that you want to improve about yourself whether it be fitness related, breaking bad habits and replacing them with good ones, or achieving a more enlightened way of life. Anything goes. 

Now that you have your list, develop a game plan for each item on the list. Simply saying '' I'm going to work out more "" isn't going to cut it because there aren't specifics on how you are going to achieve this goal. This is the reason that most new years resolutions fail. Try using the S.M.A.R.T (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely) goal method that we learned back in grade school for the items on your list. It's actually extremely helpful. Now the goal of working out more turns into ""I will go to the gym 3 times per week and work on xyz in order to lose x amount of weight by xdate. By tailoring your goals to your own needs, and planning it out in the firm of a step by step process, the goals become much more attainable and are more likely to be followed through. 

Next, plan out what you will work on first. Self improvement is a long process and can't be done by flipping a switch. Develop a goal tracking spreadsheet or a system for creating a long term plan to your journey. The goal is to turn these resolutions into habits that will stick with you for the rest of your life. 

Hold yourself to your goals and use some self discipline. A good way to do this is to share your goals with others to help keep you accountable. 

So, with all that being said, what is your vision for this upcoming year and the upcoming decade? Where do you imagine yourself in 10 years? What are your goals?"|thatblondkidalex|False|https://redd.it/ef6qyr|3|0.71|0|10|1|getmotivated
