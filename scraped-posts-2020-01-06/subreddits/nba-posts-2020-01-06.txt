ekyyp1|2020-01-06 19:33:31|"Coach Beilein takes blame for Kevin Love's on-court outburst: ""He had Chris Paul posted up, I didn’t see it. It was on me, I called something else"""|"As Collin Sexton dribbled the ball and the shot clock dwindled, Kevin Love walked closer to Sexton with his hands raised, clapped his hands in motion for the ball and Sexton passed to him. Then Love heaved a pass to Cedi Osman, who shot a 3-pointer and missed.

“Yeah, I felt we were making a play call and at the end of the second half we were in the bonus and I had Chris Paul on me. Felt swing it to me and try to throw it in the post, see if they double-team me and get a shot out of that, but that’s not what we did. Yeah, I was frustrated,” Love said.

Coach John Beilein acknowledged his mistake on the play and took the blame for the call.

“That was my mistake. I was trying to get us to slow down and try to get, not the last shot, but close to the last shot. He had Chris Paul posted up, I didn’t see it. It was on me, I called something else,” Beilein said. “I told him after. I said, ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t see it.’ I just wanted us to … we’re playing at a pace where I was afraid we weren’t going to get a great shot at time. Took my complete eyes off who he was posting up.”

This all came after a report from The Athletic on Saturday evening that Love had an emotional outburst toward general manager Koby Altman after shootaround earlier in the day. Beilein said he did not speak to Love about the report before the game.

It wasn’t just Love, though, who demonstrated frustration. It came from other players across the spectrum. It was in the way Darius Garland threw the ball toward the baseline when he had two free throws with three minutes to play. It was the way in which they all walked toward the bench, heads down. It was the way in which guys addressed each other on the bench in timeouts. There were moments of clear frustration throughout the game.

Beilein acknowledged the need to have individual conversations with players about moments of frustration.

“It’s a constant work in progress for us to get people to understand everybody is watching you out there,” he said. “As frustrated as the coach gets, as frustrated as … we can’t display that on the floor. But I think it’s been all year long, it’s difficult for some of our guys who don’t want to lose, and they want to play and they want to play better, and we just keep working on it.”

Beilein continued:

“If I do it, if anyone does it, it really doesn’t make you a better player or a better coach at that time. It’s like carrying a suitcase around with you that you have extra baggage. We don’t need to do that. So, as it’s pointed out to them or we see it, we try to address it as much as we can. The best we can, is the word I should say,” he said.

Rockets are 10-2 in this span with losses to the Kings(Buzzer beater 3 from half court) and a beat down from the Warriors(lol)

His rebounding and pace pushing style is what the rockets really needed. It adds another dynamic in their offense which makes them less predictable.

The main contributor is that almost half of his FGAs over last month have been in restricted area. He is 47/28/86 in this span.

I like reading old /r/nba threads. A lot of them are fascinating. Here’s a fun one that I stumbled across recently.

**The Original Post.**

> Nearly five years had passed between Kobe and Carmelo's 60 point game. Before them only Shaquille O'Neil, Tracy McGrady, Allen Iverson, and Gilbert Arenas had 60 point games since 2000.

>So who do you think has the best chances to drop 60 in the future? I'm not asking when you think it will happen, but what players have the best chance?

>I think obviously Kevin Durant, and Carmelo Anthony are the best scorers in the NBA so they will definitely be high on my list. LeBron is such a freak in terms of size and talent and strength he is definitely up there as well. I think that Russell and Harden could drop 60 as well, dependent on who they are playing. And lastly I think that Curry could drop 60, potentially.

>I think that Wade and Kobe might not be able to due to declines. I think they might hit upper 40s and 50, but I think 60 is a stretch for even Kobe now.

**Most recent 40+ games at the time.**

The original thread was posted on the 25th January 2014, the day after Melo’s 62pt game against Charlotte. It was his thirty-fifth career 40+pt game at that point in time.

Here are the most recent big games (at the time) from the candidates mentioned in the OP.

Durant has thirty-six career 40+pts games at that point in time. In the three weeks prior to this post, KD has scored 48pts vs Minnesota, 48pts vs Utah, 54pts vs Golden State and 46 vs Portland.

Lebron has sixty-one career 40+pt games at that point in time. His last two big games was against Boston when he put up 45 in game 6 of the 2012 ECF and when he put up 40pts vs Sacramento in March 2013.

Westbrook has five career 40+pt games at that point in time. His last two big games was against Miami when he put up 43pts in game 4 of the 2012 Finals and when he put up 45pts vs Minnesota in March 2012.

Harden has three career 40+pt games at that point in time. His last two big games was against Oklahoma when he put up 46pts in April 2013 and when he put up 45pts vs Atlanta in November 2012.

Steph has four career 40+pt games at that point in time. His last two big games was against Charlotte when he put up 43pts in December 2013 and when he put up 47pts vs Lakers in April 2013.

**Added context:**

This is KD’s MVP year.

 Russ missed a lot of time this season due to knee surgery. 

Harden has been at Houston for a season and a half. 

Steph was breaking out and would make his first all-NBA team. 

This is Lebron’s last year with Wade. Wade only played 54 games this season. 

Kobe had returned from his Achilles injury already but had injured his knee vs Memphis in the previous month. 

**So what’s the answer?** 

Here is every 60+pt game since Melo’s 2014 game. The answer to the question was actually Lebron two months later but it’s interesting to see who else has (and hasn’t) hit the 60pt mark in the last six years.

**Would that list be surprising to people in 2014?**

Steph, KD, Harden, Lebron and Melo were popular/common answers and all were recognised as having the potential to put up big numbers in 2014. Harden’s done it four times, Lebron has done it once but Steph and KD both share a career high of 54pts so far. Melo would only hit the 40pt mark five more times in his career and never came close to 60pts again.

Obviously Booker hadn't been drafted yet, but what about Kobe, Klay and Dame? Did anyone see those performances coming in 2014? 

Actually, yes.

--------------------------------

For Dame, someone posted

> Damian Lillard. He has a bright future. 

And another said

> I think Lillard has a better shot at it if he's killing it from 3. I don't see either him or Aldridge actually doing it though

-----------------------------------

For Klay, /u/MarioTheGoat posted

>Dark horse is Klay Thompson. He's a fucking assassin and doesn't get enough recognition because IMHO he has the best shooter in the world on his team. 

And another said

> Klay Thompson. 20-25 from three

---------------------------------

Kobe was actually a really popular choice.

Someone said 

> I'd love to see Kobe just try to do it once before he retires. I think if he REALLY wanted to, he could, on like 50 shots.

And someone else said

> I honestly wouldn't be that shocked if Kobe hit 60 again. Obviously he needs to be healthy, and really just needs a game where they are down (Lakers aren't really that great right now and no one would blame Kobe for taking all the shots with the teammates he has right now) and he's feeling it which happens a lot considering how long he has been playing. Kobe won't shy away from shooting the shit out of the ball so I could see it happening.

----------------------------------------------

And as a final conclusion, here’s an interesting comment from /u/andthatssometrainshit.

>Kevin Durant is an obvious choice, particularly if he plays on a team without Westbrook or another solid number 2 option at some point in his career. Curry, too. Westbrook and Harden can probably do it, but they would need to be on worse teams. Consider the 60 point games that have occurred since 2000-2001. The best record of any of those teams was 45-37 (the 06-07 Lakers), and even that was probably a little high for their personnel. The others: 42-40 (05-06 Lakers), 43-39 (04-05 Sixers), 41-41 (06-07 Wizards), and 21-61 (03-04 Magic). In today's NBA, if you're on a 50-win team, it's near impossible to score 60."|hedonistolid|False|https://redd.it/ekyrnq|52|1.0|0|31|1|nba

>“I think there’s teams that would do it,” said Windhorst. “One of the things that’s been remarkable to me as I’ve talked to some people around the league about Kevin in the last 48-72 hours is there’s a lot of people who really, really value him and really like him, but the problem is because of the contract, it’s a difficult to come up with a trade for. Because the Cavs are viewing trading an All-Star level player. The other teams are saying ‘Yeah, he’s a good player but we’re taking on this money.’ They think they’re bailing the Cavs out.”

ekx52u|2020-01-06 17:23:05|Despite their 12-24 record, the Pelicans have slightly outscored opponents when neither Okafor or Melli is on the floor (which is most of the time)|"According to Cleaning the Glass, which filters out garbage time:

Pelicans overall (3637 possessions): 109.1 Ortg/112.0 Drtg, -2.9 Net rating

Pelicans without Okafor or Melli (2297 possessions): 111.6 Ortg/110.2 Drtg, +1.4 Net rtg

Pelicans with Okafor and/or Melli (1340 possessions): 104.8 Ortg/115.1 Drtg, -10.3 Net rtg

I don't think this is entirely on those two players (the Pels might just have a very weak bench lineup), but when you look at it lineup by lineup, it's clear how much the Pels have been hurt by not having a real rim protector on defense, or a solid, low turnover roll man who can screen in offense.

Also on this note, I don't think I'm alone in being pleasantly surprised by Hayes. His general feel for the game and BBIQ is a lot better than what was expected form him at this stage."|BEE_REAL_|False|https://redd.it/ekx52u|29|0.88|0|24|1|nba

ekxicz|2020-01-06 17:50:02|There is now a 7 team race for the 8th seed in the West, who is going to get it?|"I think the Thunder are pretty much a playoff lock now since two teams would have to overtake them(currently 5-6 wins ahead of the pack).

**Spurs/Grizz/Blazers/Wolves/Suns/Kings/Pelicans** are left to fight for the 8th seed and all are at 12-15 wins right now. 

-Spurs/Blazers are the favorites since they have the veteran players. 

-Wolves/Suns had a hot start but cooled down significantly.

-Kings had a terrible start, looked alive, then sucked again. 

-Pelicans had a terrible start but are starting to look alive. Pelicans might be interesting w/ Zion back soon and Lonzo is looking good. 

-Grizz might be too young but they are by far the most entertaining team to watch out of these 7 so far(Zion should bump the Pelicans entertainment value up a lot). 

So who you got making it? I'll go with the homer answer and pick the current 14th seed baby Laker-Pelicans with how well they've been playing recently and the debut of Zion coming up."|badpizzaisstillgood|False|https://redd.it/ekxicz|22|0.9|0|43|1|nba

 Joel Embiid, despite probably being the best player out of three, has had most of his numbers drop slightly this year and the 76ers as team haven't been playing as well as predicated as they're currently the 5th/6th seed in the East

eki90s|2020-01-05 20:06:05|[OC] The Small-Market Spotlight for January 2020 - shining a light on the more ignored teams in /r/NBA|"[Small-Market Spotlight for December 2019](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/e534fi/oc_the_smallmarket_spotlight_for_december_2019/)

**[I don't expect anyone to read the entire thing lol. Feel free to check out the teams that you're curious about and ignore the ones that you aren't]**

So as a break from the constant chatter about the Lakers, Rockets, Clippers, Luka, Raptors, Celtics and Sixers: here's a brief report on the 23 other teams that /r/nba tends to ignore. I’ve gone into every team subreddit in search of three things that might seem interesting/surprising to a non-fan and summarized them down below.

This is mainly a surface level reading of what's going on though, so I hope that other fans will come in and correct me if I'm super offbase or elaborate on the things that I've chosen to summarise.

*Bucks and Jazz fans protested about being ignored in the last thread so I’m experimenting with being over-inclusive this month hence the length.

--------------------------------------------------

#THE EASTERN CONFERENCE

**Magic**

- Current record: 16-20 and 8th in the Eastern Conference.

- Orlando Magic are 6-9 in their last 15 games with Vucevic putting up 20/10 with 2 stocks. Their fans REALLY enjoyed the wins against the Heat and the Sixers. As of today, they are 2 games ahead of 9th placed Charlotte and seem well-placed to make the playoffs again this season. 

- Except injury woes have struck with their entire wing rotation currently being out. The worst, of course, being Johnathan Isaac who was making a push for All-Defence being injured for two months. Gordon, Okeke and Aminu just make it worse for Magic fans.

- For those curious about Mo Bamba: “He’s raw af, decent shot blocker, better than expected 3pt shooter. He’s probably 3 years away from starting for this team. He shows the signs — but like many young players, he’s yet to do it consistently. He’s improved compared to where he was from the start of the season though.”

**Pacers**

- Current record: 22-14 and 6th in the Eastern Conference.

- Pacers have beaten Philly, Lakers, Celtics, Toronto and Jazz this season and could finish with a home seed this season. Why are they so good? “imagine having to face a 7 footer who bullies the fuck out of people in the paint and is top 5 in the league in rebounds, while also having to face a 7 footer who shoots the 3 at 38% and averages over 2.0 blocks a game. not to mention the former ROY and MIP in the same starting lineup with one of the most underrated scorers in the league (TJ Warren).”

- Recent WojBomb:’ Pacers All-Star Victor Oladipo hopeful for a late January/early February return from ruptured quad tendon’

- There is a growing worry that Indiana won’t have any All-Star representation in the upcoming All-Star game. Sabonis is behind Hayward, Blake and Vince in fan voting while Brogdon didn’t even make the top 10. Tacko Fall has double the votes of Sabonis and /r/pacers is willing to riot if he ends up a starter.

**Hornets:**

- Current record: 15-23 and 8th in the Eastern Conference.

- Terry Rozier is 1 year older than Kendrick Nunn, producing the same numbers as Fred Vanvleet and Jamal Murray on the same pay as Jeff Teague and Reggie Jackson. /r/hornets is dividing on Scary Terry with some saying that he is empty stats and others saying that he is better than expected.

- PJ Washington has returned from injury and has continued his nice form. In his last 5 games, he is averaging 15.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 9 of 17 from 3-point range in that time. Some believe he’s been a top 5 rookie this year.

- /r/hornets has been discussing realistic trade targets. While most seem to want 1st round picks to help shore up their young squad, others mentioned names like Poetl, Dunn and Beasley as guys who fit in with what they’re trying to do.

**Pistons:**

- Current record: 13-23 and 11th in the Eastern Conference.

- While are sad about Drummond leaving, most are excited about the idea of a full rebuild where they’ll finally be moving in the right direction. Hawks are the frontrunners but new reports say that Portland and Charlotte might be interested. If any decent offers come in for Blake and Rose, fans seem comfortable with losing them too.

- Did you know Detroit had a young core? Me neither. Their names are Sekou Doumbouya, Bruce Brown, Christian Wood, Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and Luke Kennard. Most will already know Kennard but Sekou is a 19yo rookie who’s started to see serious minutes. He has a double double in his last two games and /r/DetroitPistons are getting excited.

- The Lions, Tigers and Red Wings are still all below .500 too so life is still pretty rough right now for Detroits sports fans.

**Cavs:**

- Current record: 10-25 and 13th in the Eastern Conference.

- Kevin Love is throwing major tantrums right now but what does Cleveland fans think? Reactions are mixed but my favourite comment is this one: “120 mil for getting carried by LeBron, and he still not happy”. This story is already in the limelight so not much to add here.

- 2nd year Collin Sexton is currently in the firing line. Hes upped his PPG, RPG, FG% all while playing less minutes than last year so far. But he needs to get back to shooting 3s efficiently because hes had a major decline from behind the arc. He was at 40% from 3 last year but has only made 27% of his 3s this year. Some find his tunnel vision infuriating while others argue that he’s a scapegoat for a weak roster and terrible FO. For those who are curious, Sexton putting up 18/2 on a rookie contract. To compare, Jamal Murray is putting up 18/5 on $33m a year.

- Cavs have 14 games left in January with only 4 of them being .500 teams. Considering 90% of their wins have come against other teams with a losing record, don’t be surprised if the Cavs go on a winning streak sometime soon.

**Bucks:**

- Current record: 32-5 and 1st in the Eastern Conference.

- Acting like the team with the best record in the NBA and the reigning MVP is ignored is silly so I’ll just highlight some non-Giannis content to appease the Bucks fans. Here’s [a pic from Eric Bledsoe’s birthday party](https://i.imgur.com/A5Yl8DQ.jpg). 

- Everyone knows Giannis dominates inside the paint but [Middleton has everywhere else absolutely covered](https://i.imgur.com/Pdno20h.jpg)

- Bucks have the best record and that’s not going to change this month. The only .500 teams they face this month are Boston and Denver but the big event for Milwaukee is their game against the Hornets in Paris. Due to the travel probably. This will be their only game between the 20th and the 28th of the month.

**Nets:**

- Current record: 16-18 and 7th in the Eastern Conference.

- Yes, Kyrie and  is injured but quick summary of the rest of the squad. Levert has just returned from injury and played 15 minutes yesterday. David Nwaba is loved and missed.. Taurean Prince is ass. Theo Pinson is ass. Kenny Atkinson may or may not be ass.

- The Nets All-Decade team is Dinwiddie/D-Lo/Johnson/Thad Young/Brook which I found interesting. How well do you reckon that team would do in today’s Eastern Conference? Maybe they get a first-round upset.

- The Nets have the biggest active losing streak in the NBA. They’ve lost their last 5 with three of them coming against Houston, Toronto and Dallas, one being an OT loss to Minnesota and a loss to local rival, the Knicks. The schedule for the rest of the month is pretty tough with games coming up against Utah, Miami, 2x Philly, Milwaukee, and Lakers. If they slip up against any of the teams below .500, don’t be surprised if they drop out of the playoff spots.

**Bulls:**

- Current record: 13-23 and 10th in the Eastern Conference.

- The average age of Chicago’s 8 man rotation yesterday was 23.75 years old. “ Kris Dunn, Thad Young and Satoransky are just stop gap players. The real core is Coby, Lavine, Markkannen, WCJ and Gafford”. Also, Daniel Gafford may prove to be the steal of the 2019 draft as he leads his draft class with 1.22 blocks per game while only averaging 11 minutes.

- After a poor start to the season, Markkannen’s form is finally picking up. In December, Lauri Markkannen averaged 17.6/6.1/1.4 in 65% TS. Some are frustrated that he only gets 12 shots a game while others believe that his terrible chemistry with Lavine is why he hasn’t taken a leap yet. Still, there’s little reason to lose faith and he seems due for a couple big performances.

- The Bulls have the 4th best defence in the NBA. To quote their sub, “We're 14th in the NBA in netrtg at -0.4.This means that we have the best netrtg of any team below .500. And simultaneously have a better netrtg than both the 7th and the 8th seed in the East. We’re the best shit team in the NBA.”


**Wizards:**

- Current record: 11-24 and 12th in the Eastern Conference.

- There doesn’t seem to be a lot going on in the Wizards sub. Bertans good. Rui injured. Beal beal. Everyone seems to accept that they’re redshirting right now but are ‘ happy with the direction for next year of Wall/Beal/Troy/Rui/Thomas Bryant + our lottery pick + Bertans/Ish/Admiral/Wagner/McRae bench’.

- [John Wall is practicing full contact 1v1 and is nearing a return soon.](https://streamable.com/c8m3d)

- Can’t find any other interesting things on the subreddit so let me just remind everyone that Bertans is shooting 43% on 8.6 3s a game.

**Knicks:**

- Current record: 10-25 and 14th in the Eastern Conference.

- “Mike Miller is 6-6 in his first 12 games as Knicks head coach, David Fizdale was there for 104 games and he never had a 12 game stretch as good”. After 12 games, it seems like all the things that Knicks fans thought was dumb about Fizdale was actually dumb. Using Randle and Portis as ball handlers, trying to make Kevin Knox a 2, throwing out random DNPs for no reason. Miller’s sorted all of that out and the Knicks record has improved.

- The mood is improving on /r/nyknicks. Their vets like Morris/Randle/Elfrid are being utilized properly, their young core of RJ/Frank/Knox/Mitch seem to be in good hands and their offseason targets of Zion, Kyrie and KD were a lot riskier than they first anticipated.

- Knicks next 11 games are fucking tough. In order, Clippers, Lakers, Jazz, resurgent Pelicans, Heat, Bucks, healthy Suns, Philadelphia, Cavs, Lakers, Raptors. If the Knicks can go through this stretch without being blown out by 30 once, then it’ll be a huge impovement.

**Hawks:**

- Current record: 8-28 and 15th in the Eastern Conference.

- All season, Hawks fans have been shouting about their team desperately needs a backup ballhandler because their offence straight-up dies when Trae is off the floor. Enter 2nd year Brandon Goodwin. In the last 3 games, Goodwin has averaged 12/3/3 in 76% TS. And the Hawks record in those games? Ws over the Pacers and the Magic and a last second L to the Celtics. 7 of the Hawks next 13 games are against .500 teams, so don’t expect them to be a run together just yet.

- Advanced stats no longer say that Trae Young is the worst defender in the NBA. That title now belongs to Bradley Beal who now lies at the bottom of DRPM and DRAPTOR. In fact, DRAPTOR has Trae currently as a better defender than Fox, Kennard, D’Lo, Booker, Derozan and IT as well. Please update your circlejerks accordingly.

- Quick summary of everything else. John Collins is back. Huerter is hitting good form. Hunter looks promising. Jury’s still out on Reddish. Reaction is mixed on Drummond.

------------------------------------------------------

#THE WESTERN CONFERENCE

**Thunder**

- Current record: 20-15 and 7th in the Western Conference.

- People are generally aware of how well CP3 is doing on the court, but what he’s doing off the court is going under the radar. Just from glancing at the sub, he’s bought the entire roster custom suits, is gifting floor tickets to random families, being a clear mentor for SGA and is paying for the team to go watch NFL games. Naturally, /r/okc loves this fucking guy.

- A month ago, 6 of OKC’s 8 wins come against Golden State and the Pelicans and people weren’t sure about how good they are. Now they are 9-1 in their last 10 games with notable wins over Toronto, Dallas and the Clippers. They are 2 games behind Luka and have a month where more than half of their games are against teams lower than .500. It’s not ridiculous to think that this team could finish in the top 6. 

- Though, naturally that’s only going to happen if they keep CP3, Adams, Schroder and Gallinari around. General feeling from OKC fans is that they want to ride this fun season out, make the playoffs and then accumulate more picks in the summer. Also, everyone (including me) would love to see a Rockets/OKC first round series.

**Nuggets**

- Current record: 24-11 and 2nd in the Western Conference.

- After a 3 game losing streak that culminated in a disappointing loss to Philadelphia, Denver Nuggets then went on a 10-3 streak where they racked up Ws over Lakers and Pacers. In that run, Jokic finally hit form and averaged 22/9/7,  Michael Porter Jr started his first ever game and got 25pts in 23 minutes and Gary Harris continued his All-Defence campaign.

- It’s only a minority but some people are growing concerned that Jamal Murray hasn’t taken a leap. He’s signed a max extension and his numbers have gome from 17/4 in his sophomore year to 18/5 on average efficiency in 2020. The Nuggets are still winning with him and he’s shown to be a good fit with Jokic but some fans believe their team’s ceiling is capped unless Murray becomes a biggger contributor.

- There’s a lot of Jokic content on their subreddit so here are some stray Jokic facts: Jokic is tied with Bob Cousy for 10th most triple doubles ever, he’s passed Melo to become 9th in Denver assists and BR ranked him the 35th best player of the 2010s.

**Grizzlies**

- Current record: 14-22 and 11th in the Western Conference.

- We are approaching the All-Star Break and the Grizzlies are 1 game away from the 8th seed. Do they trade Valanciunas to try and secure a lottery pick? Or do they skip this draft and aim to become the youngest playoff team in history? It’s a good problem to have and fans seem fine with either option.

- RECYCLE: They’re a contender for the most promising young core in the league. Ja, JJJ, Clarke, Anderson, Caboclo, Brooks are all 24 and under, with 27 year-old JV serving as the elder statesman. Apart from JJJ’s inability to stay out of foul trouble, there are no serious concerns.

- RECYCLE: Fans don’t seem confident about nabbing anyone in free agency or via trades. Their 2020 pick is top-6 protected and the top priority seems to be a wing that will complement Ja and JJJ.

**Jazz**

- Current record: 23-12 and 5th in the Western Conference.

- Clippers, Mavericks and the Nuggets all lose and now Utah Jazz are one game away from being the 2nd seed in the West. After a torrid run, where they went 6-2 in December, Jazz have gone 10-1 in their last 11 games with their only .500 win in that stretch coming over the Clippers. Their next 7 games are all against teams below .500 so expect this run to continue.

- Coincidentally Mike Conley has missed 13 of their last 14 games via injury. Mitchell has stepped in as PG and he looks good. Mitchell is putting up 27/6 in the Jazz’s last 5 games and the Jazz have 5 Ws. Though their schedule recently has been soft, would they have won all those games with Conley too? /r/UtahJazz thinks they definitely would have and aren’t willing to entertain discussion of trading Conley yet. 

- So far, fans are loving the Clarkson/Exum trade and they’re seeing the bench improvement already. Georges Niang is starting to get buckets. Joe Ingles has been balling out. Gobert might threepeat the DPOY. Jazz fans are having a good time right now.

**Trailblazers**

- Current record: 15-21 and 8th in the Western Conference.

- /r/trailblazers is ANNOYED that people don’t understand just how injured they are. “Portland are missing 3 starters, two of which were key defensive pieces in Collins and Nurkic, Hood who was an extremely efficient scoring option that could create his own shot, as well as now the backup center in Skal who gave valuable minutes when Hassan sat.”

- Even though they’re 8th, there’s no passion for a playoff push due to their current injuries. Nurkic and Collins aren’t expected back so several fans would rather miss out entirely than be 1st round fodder for the Lakers.

- Their sub has a massive trade thread. Summary, Love is bad because of huge contract and injury prone.Love is good because he’s a good fit and a hometown guy. Some say they shouldn’t trade but instead should get healthy and reassess. Aaron Gordon’s name also came up multiple times.

**Spurs**

- Current record: 14-20 and 9th in the Western Conference.

- Spurs were the 8th seed 5 days ago and the hunger to keep up their playoffs streak is real. Ideal scenario is a first round war against the Clippers. In terms of prospect, the subreddit is kinda low on Dejounte Murray and very high on Lonnie Walker IV. They’re desperate for him to get more minutes and think they’ve got someone potentially special on their hands. Also, it might be time for Derrick White to return to the starting five.

- In his last 7 games, Derozan is averaging 25.7pts on a nice 69% TS. Contract talks are happening soon and /r/nbaspurs are open to resigning him as long as it’s nowhere near the max. Also, there doesn’t seem to be much interesting in trading Aldridge either. They’d like to trade Forbes and Belinelli too but feel like their stock is currently low so they won’t get any value in return.

- On the Spurs’ recent decline, someone commented “I think we greatly underestimated how much losing FO people & our assistants over the years would hurt us & I think it's starting to take it's toll. Guys like Bud definitely had a great impact on our offense & losing guys like Sean Marks has hurt our FO cause they're definitely not the same either.

**Suns**

- Current record: 14-21 and 10th in the Western Conference.

- Deandre Ayton’s favourite player is Kevin Garnett and what has Monty Williams decided to do? Play Ayton at the 4. Sort of. To put it simply, on offense Baynes is 4, Ayton 5 but on defense they switch. The lineup reportedly looked good against the Knicks but fans’ only issue is who’s gonna be the bigman in the second unit. Hopefully Check Diallo can hold it down until Kaminsky comes back from injury.

-  2nd year Mikal Bridges is a minor unsung hero of Phoenix. ‘He has the highest net ratg of any player on their team and has legit All-Defence potential and will probably be underpaid for the entirety of his career due to lack of splashiness’. Fans think he doesn’t play enough minutes but he seems like a big part of the Sun’s future.  

- After an 8-game losing streak, the Suns are now 3-1 in their last four with 2 wins coming against 8th seed rivals, Sacramento and Portland. In that run, Ayton has played great defence, Oubre Jr is averaging 26/8/3 and Booker is averaging 33/8/4. 6 of their next opponents are below .500 so we’ll start to have a sense of how good this Suns team really is.

**Timberwolves**

- Current record: 13-21 and 12th in the Western Conference.

- “The #Twolves are not moving KAT anytime soon. Stories like this create discussion, and selfishly, are good for business, whether for radio or TV. But just know that Wolves folks would tell you that KAT more than anything wants to win here. Year 1 of 5 offers time.” Trading for D’Lo discussions have started up again but having 3 max contracts of D’Lo, Wiggins and Towns isn’t going to scare anyone in the playoffs, so it seems like they’d have to get rid of Wiggins somehow too. 

- It seems that the Embiid beef, trade rumours and being a 7 foot Steph Curry has done wonders for his popularity this season. From being behind an injured Boogie in All-Star voting last year, Towns is now 5th behind Lebron, AD, Kawhi and PG despite his team’s losing record.

- Goddamn, it’s close at the bottom of the West! After an 11 game losing streak, The Timberwolves find themselves 1 game out from the 8th seed. They are 3-2 in their last 5 with 8 of their next 13 games coming against .500 teams. Do Timberwolves fans dare to believe they can make the 8th seed? No. Most of them have no faith at all.

**Kings**

- Current record: 12-24 and 13th in the Western Conference.

- Of all the teams battling for the 8th seed, the Kings subreddit is the angriest. They’ve soured on Buddy Hield, they’re shitting on their FO, they’re pining for Boogie, Shump and Joerger, they want Luke fired now. It is bad. And they’re only two games out from the 8th seed! 

- But why are Kings fans so angry? Because they’re 1-9 in their last 10 and fans believe they could be pushing for the 4th/5th seed if certain things were different. 4 of those losses came against Pacers, Rockets, Nuggets, Clippers while another 4 losses came against 8th seed rivals, Grizzlies, Suns, Timberwolves, Pelicans. Of their next 12, 6 are against .500 teams and another two are huge games against Suns and Timberwolves. January is a huge month for them.

- Who does Kings trade for to get better? No-one. Common sentiment seems to be ‘Just hold steady and get a good draft pick and hope the young guys start developing.” 

**Pelicans**

- Current record: 12-24 and 14th in the Western Conference.

- The New Orleans Pelicans can still make the playoffs. “An amazing 14 of their final 15 games are against teams with losing records, nine of them are at home, and the one winning team (Philadelphia, which visits April 11) may end up sitting players to rest for the playoffs. For those of you tracking such things this early, the Pels will also own the tie-break with Portland if they win either of the teams’ final two meetings.” They have currently won 6 of their last 8 games. Derrick Favors has returned and is balling out. The fans (and the media) would love a first round series against the Lakers.

- What about Zion? Isn’t he redshirting? Not according to /r/NOLApelicans. That’s a dumb narrative people are selling to get clicks. Reports say that the team is just being extra conservative with their #1 pick and they expect him to debut this year. General sentiment is that “If he’s injury prone, then he’s injury prone. Sitting healthy players does not benefit the player. Zion will only get better at basketball if he plays. He will only get in true NBA basketball shape, if he plays basketball. Sitting an extra 30 games this season isn’t going to extend his longevity.”

- Lonzo ‘is a bust’ Ball is averaging 25/8 in his last three games on 65% TS. What do Pelicans’ fans attribute such a crazy turnaround to? The introduction of Favors helps but also, “Lonzo has been saying that he feels healthier than ever, and these last few games his bounce has been WAY more noticeable as he's been dunking it more often - he had an insane tip dunk in the blazers game. So the reason for his lack of aggressiveness issues might have been also related to health - he's looked way more athletic these past few games. His 3 has been falling much more, he has been driving more - more aggressive overall and PATIENT - he's also looked more athletic, that in summary makes the current lonzo current.”"|hedonistolid|False|https://redd.it/eki90s|383|0.96|0|65|1|nba

ekwn1n|2020-01-06 16:48:15|[OC] Western All-Star Starters Discussion|"Western All-Star Discussion Starter 

	If I wasn’t writing this for reddit and for my archival purposes I’d bother with a relatively unfunny introduction or a rant about the monotony of the All-Star game, but since I am let’s just get straight into it shall we?

Western Starters

	For the Western All-Star starters there should be (but probably aren’t if the early returns from the fan vote published on Jan 2 are anything to go by) 4 locks. In no particular order, those players are: Lebron James (LAL), James Harden (HOU), Anthony Davis (LAL), and Luka Dončić (DAL). Why? Well, while the answer to that could question could be as simple as “they’re 4 of the 5 front-runners for the MVP award” or so long that they deserve their own post, I feel like the arguments for the spots as starters is pretty obvious. So instead of re-hashing or re-stating the aforementioned obvious in great detail, I’m just going to keep things simple and stick to bullet points.   

Lebron James (at age 35 mind you)
•	Is averaging a career high in APG (11.0 PG) while sustaining an Assist to Turnover Ratio of 2.9
•	Ranks 4th in NBA Math’s TPA (219.79), 1st in ESPN’s RPM (9.71), and 4th in BBall Index’s PIPM (6.04)
•	Has led the Los Angeles Lakers to 1st seed in the West and the 2nd best record across the league 
•	Over the course of 1229 minutes this season, has earned a NetRtg of 12.27 (even more impressive though is the 11.61 he’s managed with Anthony Davis off the floor)

James Harden 
•	Is averaging a career high in PPG (38.4), which also happens to be the 4th highest total of all time (behind 3 seasons from the likely never-to-be-matched Wilt Chamberlain) 
•	Is currently on pace to record the 2nd highest OBPM in history (behind Stephen Curry’s consensus MVP winning 2015-16 season)
•	Is also on pace to record career highs in PER, OBPM, & Win Shares per 48
•	Has earned a NetRtg of 8.57 and 12.33 in the minutes he’s played and those he’s played without Russell Westbrook respectively (more on that later)
•	Currently leads the league in PPP (points per possession) for isolation plays 1.19, and is doing so while 14.6 such possessions per game

Anthony Davis* 
•	Along with James, has turned the Los Angeles Lakers into NBA finals front-runners
•	Is averaging a per game stat-line of 27.7PTS/3.2AST/9.5TRB/1.5STL/2.6BLK on 50.7/29.9/86.2 shooting splits
•	Ranks 6th in NBA Math’s TPA (157.63) & 5th in BBall Index’s PIPM (5.15)
•	Is a leading DPOY candidate

*If there is an argument to be made against Davis’ spot as an All-Star starter, it starts and ends with his On/Off splits, which suggest that without James on the floor, Davis is leading a losing a team.  

Luka Dončić (at age 20 mind you)
•	Has led the Mavericks to the 6th seed and a 22-13 record in the west, surpassing even the most optimistic of projections and all while Kristaps Porzingis continues to look inconsistent after a sustained period of injury
•	Is 3rd in the league in PPG, 3rd in APG, and 18th in RPG all while averaging per game stat-line of 29.4PTS/8.9AST/9.7TRB on 47.0/32.5/81.3 shooting splits
•	Ranks 3rd in NBA Math’s TPA (273.75), 17th in ESPN’s RPM, 2nd in BBall Index’s PIPM, and 3rd in PER
•	Most impressive of all though, is as of writing, the Dončić Mavs possess the highest team Offensive Rtg (an estimate of points scored by a team per 100 possessions) in history (116.6)

And now, with the formalities out of the way, we can begin our discussion in earnest, starting with the awarding of the final front court starting spot…

The case for Nikola Jokić (DEN) as the final front court starter for the Western All-Stars is an interesting one. At the beginning of the season, most of the discussion surrounding Jokić was pretty negative, with many citing an obvious lack of conditioning and an apparent lack of enthusiasm as the main factors in his mediocre (by his standards) play. That being said, as of early December Jokić has really rounded (rimshot) into form, failing to record a single digit outing in points since a Dec 6 loss to the Boston Celtics. As a result, the Nuggets too have looked a whole new team, climbing to 2nd in the Western Conference despite failing to play their best basketball for the first 2 months of the year. 

As for why Jokić deserves the spot over the rest of the field, I would argue there are 3 other contenders for the sport worth discussing:

As of writing, Karl-Anthony Towns (MIN) and Paul George (LAC) have played 23 & 26 games respectively, for a grand total of 779 & 799 minutes. Meanwhile, Jokić has played in all 35 games his Nuggets have played, for a grand total of 1084 minutes. Now, while availability matters less and less for awards like these the higher your tier of NBA stardom (Jokić, Towns & George all belonging in that 2nd tier, 5th-15th best players in the world range), it does matter. And while Towns has probably been the better player when available, injuries have cost him a significant part of the season. 

Speaking of availability, there is also the case of Kawhi Leonard to consider, who to his credit is both a 1st tier star and has played more than Towns and George (28 games and 893 minutes). So, if not availability, what separates Jokić and Leonard? Well, not much really. With regards to their counting stats, Leonard averages more points (25.3 to 18.1) and steals (1.8 to 0.9) per game while Jokić averages more assists (6.4 to 5.1) and rebounds (9.8 to 7.6), and both average the same number of blocks (0.5). As for some of the more common advanced metrics, while Leonard pipes Jokić in PER (24.4 to 23.3), Jokić bests Leonard in WS/48, BPM, & VORP. 
Even their respective team-wide impact appears similar. This season, Leonard is showing massive strides in his playmaking, proving capable of making interior and cross-court passes he previously would have seen, but thrown too late or early. Granted, he still doesn’t sniff Jokić’s level as a playmaker, as is obvious when watching the two play (and backed by their respective 1.5 & 2.5 Assist-to-Turnover Ratio’s). All that being said, when one takes a look at their respective NetRtg’s, the numbers show two players who have immensely positive impacts on their team performance. The Clippers have a 11.72 NetRtg with Leonard on the floor compared to a -2.80 with him off, while Denver has a 7.49 NetRtg with Jokić on the floor and a -2.86 with him off it. And then there are their team’s records (Den is 24-11 & LAC are 26-12). 
Ultimately though, I would give the edge to Jokić, as while both have played through bouts of inconsistently to record impressive seasons, one has done so with a far less-loaded supporting cast. 

TL; DR:

Back Court: James Harden (Duh)
Back Court: Luka Dončić (Duh)
Front Court: Lebron James (Duh)
Front Court: Anthony Davis (Duh)
Front Court: Nikola Jokić (Towns & George haven’t played enough/Leonard has been just as inconsistent, but Jokić has really rounded into form)"|SnyperTheillfinger|False|https://redd.it/ekwn1n|5|0.8|0|14|1|nba

Some teams have galloped out to great starts -- some teams have stumbled out of the gates -- and some teams look like a horse who broke his leg and needs to get sent to the glue factory.

Our intention with this new series to focus on some of those ailing squads and offer some possible [remedies](https://images.app.goo.gl/rcL9anxwmLw4uAJw7) for their long-term health. We already took a look at one team in dire need of help with the [New York Knicks](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/e89900/oc_dr_zans_cure_for_what_ails_ya_the_sick_sick/?st=k519i1ew&sh=505ba0df), and now we're going to examine a team that's not living up to their potential yet.

######**The PHILADELPHIA 76ers**

**Misdiagnosis: Rotten Core**

To be clear, the Philadelphia 76ers are a good basketball team. They're coming off two 50-win seasons, and are on pace for yet another 50-win season this year (currently at 23-14.)

However, this isn't a franchise or fan base that will be content with 50-win seasons forever. The end goal of this ""Process"" was always a championship ring, or at the very least a Finals appearance or two. And at the moment, that trip to the Finals is no guarantee. The Sixers have lost 4 in a row and have stumbled to the 6th seed. There's a tight pack in that 2-6 range, but all five of those teams appear to be a notch below the Milwaukee Bucks. 

More and more, we're hearing grumblings about the roster construction. About the fit of Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons as the core duo. Does this team need to -- *gasp* -- blow it up???

Personally, I'm not as much of a pyromaniac as others who love to see that dynamite and those smoldering flames. Consider me a pacifist. Someone who favors tweaks and adjustments rather than starting from scratch.

Because, I would submit, this foundation is NOT fundamentally flawed. Sure, Ben Simmons is not the type of player who can fit seamlessly on any roster (in the same way a shooting wing like a Kevin Durant or Paul George might.) Sure, there's some clunkiness to the halfcourt offense with both stars in the lineup. But at the end of the day, there are more positives than negatives here. They're both young. They both have great size for their position. They both play tough D. Together, that gives the Sixers an edge and identity over most teams. 

However, to take that next step from good to great, the team is going to have to take a hard look in the mirror. When I look at this team myself, here are the flaws and possible fixes that I see. 

---

**Actual Diagnosis: Rotten Rotation**

The pairing between Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid can work. However, because they're such unique and specific talents, it becomes paramount that the *rest* of the roster fit together like a glove around them. That's a challenge for Elton Brand and any GM. In theory, it's easy to say -- ""add a bunch of 3+D wings!"" -- then it is to actually *find* those wings.

This summer, the Philadelphia 76ers lost forward Jimmy Butler to free agency, but replaced him with another star: Al Horford. Although Horford is now 33, he's still a very good addition to any roster. He's a high-IQ player who's still a good defender, a good ball mover (3.7 assists per game this season), and a capable stretch big.

However, you can quibble about the ""fit"" on this specific Sixers team. Horford fancies himself a power forward (which was possibly part of the draw to Philly), but sliding over to that spot negates some of his advantages. For a center, he's a good shooter. For a power forward? He's about average. He's been below average this year, hitting just 33.8% of his threes and netting a true shooting of only 52.2%. 

Horford's shooting will likely bounce back to some degree this season, but in the long term, he's going to be in decline. And that's a big concern. Horford is good at 33 years old, but will he still be good at 34? At 35? Brand and the Sixers took a sizable gamble on him, locking him in for a 4-year deal at near $25M a season. It's looking more and more likely that contract will get ugly in the back half of its life.

In the meantime, and in the future, the Sixers should think about possibly staggering Horford and Embiid as much as possible. Their offense isn't on track right now, grading as only the 16th best in the NBA according to basketball reference. Perhaps sliding Horford to a 6th man role (and still playing him 30 minutes a night) would work, presuming you can slot in a good wing in the starting lineup in his place.

And that brings us to the second (and bigger) problem on the team. There simply aren't a lot of options. The top 5 is strong, but the bench is woefully thin. Furkan Korkmaz is OK, but nothing special. Mattise Thybulle is promising, but still a rookie. Second-year players like Zhaire Smith, Shake Milton, and Jonah Bolden haven't broken out yet. Veterans Mike Scott and James Ennis are aging more like Chris Tucker than P.J. Tucker. 

Not only does the limited options hurt the Sixers in terms of their offensive firepower, but it hurts in terms of their flexibility as well. Coach Brett Brown can't tinker with too many lineups or strategies because he's got limited cards in his hand. If we can give him some more weapons, then perhaps this team can be more dangerous in turn.

---

**Prescription: A new 6th man**

The Philadelphia 76ers will make the playoffs. And as long as Joel Embiid is 100% healthy, then it won't matter much who their 9th or 10th man will be. Rotations will shrink, and their lack of depth will become less of an issue than usual. They'll only need a strong 8 man rotation to make some real noise out East.

The Sixers aren't too far away from that. As mentioned, Furkan Korkmaz is playable. Backup PG Trey Burke is decent, and Matisse Thybulle has some real upside as a 3+D player. But still, you'd like to see an upgrade here. You'd like a real difference maker who can either anchor the second unit as a scorer, or a plug-in 5th pseudo-starter who would allow them to stagger their current stars more often (whether that results in Al Horford coming off the bench or not.)

The hard part of this prescription is that the Sixers don't have many means to purchase it. Their salary cap is bloated, slotted to pay out over $130M over the next few years. Their cupboard of trade assets is also limited, with no R1 pick this year. They're also lacking mid-range contracts that can work as fillers -- with no one in the $6-10M range that they can toss into a deal.

If the Sixers do make a trade for a better 6th-7th man, they'll have to be creative. They don't have a R1 pick, but they own Atlanta and New York's R2 pick. And as luck would have it, those are two of the worst teams in the NBA right now. Those picks should be in the 30-35 range, which gives them moderate value. Those picks, along with Zhaire Smith, represent their best chance at cobbling together a compelling trade package.

What's out there for that modest price? Let's take a look.

**Meds On the Market**

**SG J.J. REDICK, New Orleans Pelicans**

*as a player*

Philadelphia 76ers fans are more than familiar with Mr. Jonathan Clay Redick, who must have added the extra ""J"" in his name because of his shooting stroke. In his first season with Philadelphia (at age 33), Redick set a career high with 17.1 points per game. He followed that up by setting *another* career high with 18.1 PPG last season. Still, Redick’s performance in the playoffs left the team wanting more from the position, which resulted in a parting of the ways in free agency. 

Now in New Orleans, Redick has kept on chugging. The Pelicans' season hasn't gone according to plan, but Redick is giving the team exactly what you'd expect. He hasn't lost his shooting touch at all; in fact, he's blazing at 46.0% from three this season. 

Bringing Redick back to Philadelphia wouldn't be admitting to a mistake; it made sense to try and find a better defensive player in the starting lineup. Rather, Redick would contribute to the team in a different way. If he returns to Philly, he'd come off the bench and play about 25 minutes a night. In that role, he could give the second unit some pop and prevent any prolonged scoring/shooting slumps. There's very little risk of growing pains or adjustment either because he'd obviously be familiar with the system.

*as an asset*

The biggest issue with Redick right now is his age (35) and his sagging defensive performance. He's not cheap either, scheduled to get paid $13.5M this season and $13.5M the next. Unfortunately for the Pelicans, the team isn't likely to make waves in the Western Conference by the time that contract expires. 

Despite that, I doubt that the Pelicans would dump Redick for nothing. He serves as a good mentor for them, and will make their young stars Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson more effective with his spacing. However, if a team came to David Griffin with a genuine asset (let's say Zhaire Smith + contract filler), he'd have to listen. The Sixers would have to add up a bunch of contracts to make the math work (Zhaire + Mike Scott + Kyle O'Quinn + James Ennis, etc). That could be a risk because it'd test their already-tenuous depth. However, the goal isn't to have a strong 12-man depth chart; you want a strong 7-8 man rotation to make your playoff push.

**SG E'TWAUN MOORE, New Orleans Pelicans**

*as a player*

When the New Orleans Pelicans signed E'Twaun Moore to a sizable contract a few years ago, the reaction of most fans was... *who?* And even now, that's still the consensus take on Moore.

However, savvy NBA fans know that Moore has been an effective player for New Orleans. In a sense, he's what teams want in a ""3+D"" wing. He's shot over 42% from three in each of the past three seasons. Defensively, he's a little undersized in terms of his height (6'4""), but he's aided by a 6'9"" wingspan that allows him to guard SGs and SFs effectively.

E'Twaun Moore's minutes are down this season (from 30 to 20, basically), due to increased depth and some injuries. However, when he's back to 100%, he can be an effective 5th starter or a high-level backup. Philadelphia could debate starting Moore (and sliding Horford to a 6th man role), or simply use him as a SG/SF backup to soak up minutes.

*as an asset*

If the New Orleans Pelicans decide to hold a garage sale, the Sixers and all contenders should be eyeing E'Twaun Moore. He's on the final year of a contract that will pay him $8.5M over the course of this season. It doesn't appear like Moore (age 30) will be a big part of the Pelicans' future, so they should theoretically be open to dealing him for future assets.

A deal here could be as simple as contract filler (like Kyle O'Quinn, Raul Neto, James Ennis, etc) plus one of those high R2 picks. Again, the Sixers' R2 picks will be at the top of the round, so they're not much different from a late first rounder.

---

**PF MARVIN WILLIAMS, Charlotte Hornets**

*as a player*

Historically, Marvin Williams may be best known as the hyped-up freshman who came off the bench for UNC and somehow managed to get drafted at # 2 ahead of the likes of Chris Paul. However, he's quietly hung around the league for years and years, becoming a solid starter in the process. He's played in 1046 games and started 827 of them.

The key for Williams' longevity has been his increased range and his effectiveness as a stretch four. Last season, he would have averaged 12.8 points and 6.9 rebounds per 36 minutes, hitting 36.6% of his threes in the process. That may not be anything to write home about, but it's enough to be a serviceable starter. Williams is also known as a good teammate, adding to his credibility as a reliable veteran.

Unfortunately for Williams, ""reliable veteran"" is not what the rebuilding Charlotte Hornets are looking for right now. His minutes have dropped from 28 to 20 this season, and he hasn't started a game all year (after starting 75/75 last season.) Now 33, Williams is past his prime, but he can still be a contributor for most teams. Philadelphia could debate starting Williams over Al Horford for extra spacing, or simply using him as an upgrade on Mike Scott.

*as an asset*

Presumably, the Charlotte Hornets would be willing to move Marvin Williams for future assets. He's a free agent this summer, and is not going to be a huge part of their future. I imagine they've already tried to shop him to contenders already.

However, one of the reasons that's hard to do is because of a fat salary that's going to pay him $15M this season. That's not an easy contract to match, especially for a team like Philadelphia that doesn't have a lot of mid-range contracts. They'd need to package together a lot of pieces (Mike Scott + James Ennis + Kyle O'Quinn + Raul Neto + more) to make the math work. And certainly, the Hornets would need something more than expiring contracts to make a deal like this worth it on their end. Could they get Zhaire Smith as a throw-in? Unlikely. Would a R2 pick be enough? Maybe. Two R2s? Probably. But hey, Elton Brand, Mitch Kupchak, you figure out the details here; my job is to be a matchmaker, not a negotiator.

---

**OTHER OPTIONS**

The Sixers should look around the league for similar templates to these. That is: solid veterans who are playing for teams that may be tanking soon. To that end, PG **Langston Galloway** (DET) is another good option. Galloway (on a $8M expiring) is more of a spacer than a traditional point guard, but that would work well on a team with Ben Simmons. For the Sixers, he'd be a nice option off the bench.

The Knicks' SG **Wayne Ellington** (owed $8M + $8M) is also a good shooter, although he carries sizable risk coming off an Achilles injury. If he's healthy and 100%, he can be a bootleg J.J. Redick for you. If he's *not* healthy and able to contribute, then he'd be an albatross contract. On the bright side, he should be more than ""available"" given the Knicks' situation.

If you want to dumpster dive and look at the free agent pile, there are some other risks to consider. SG **J.R. Smith** was a complete disaster towards the end of his run in Cleveland, but perhaps he'd be more motivated on a competitive team. Fellow vet SG **Iman Shumpert** will be a more reliable source of effort/defense, although his shot was inconsistent even in his prime.

I'd be remiss not to mention two ""big names"" as well. Memphis SF **Andre Iguodala** will likely get bought out eventually (it'll be hard to find a trade partner to match his contract.) Would he fit in a return to Philly? Eh. Kinda sorta. He'd be another capable defender, but it's hard to envision how an aging Iguodala is a notable upgrade over an improving Mattise Thybulle.

Of course, the splashiest move would be to bring in Cleveland PF **Kevin Love**. Love and Al Horford would be a near 1:1 match in terms of contract salary and contract length. From Philly's perspective, you can argue that Love would fit better into the offense given his superior shooting and that the team can afford to take the subsequent hit on D. He's also ""available"" (especially after the Sham Charania's reports about his tirade.) The rebuilding Cleveland Cavs wouldn't have much interest in a 33-year-old Al Horford, but maybe there's some version of a 3-way trade to be had here. Overall, this type of semi-blockbuster would probably be too risky on all sides, but it's a fun hypothetical to consider nonetheless."|ZandrickEllison|False|https://redd.it/ekfp2c|232|0.93|0|36|1|nba

ek8j6b|2020-01-05 05:13:39|"[Kevin Love] ""A lot of non truths being shared...but I’ve learned that we live in a world where people remember accusations and not rebuttals. Let them paint whatever picture they want. Fact is — I love my teammates. 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻"""|"[Source](https://twitter.com/kevinlove/status/1213685496246865925?s=20)

Important to note that Chris Fedor tweeted the following recently: 

> One #Cavs player who was on the floor, right next to Kevin Love and Koby Altman following shootaround this afternoon: “I didn’t think it was a big deal at all. I’ve heard a lot worse. That’s why I’m surprised when you told me it was a story”

[Source](https://twitter.com/ChrisFedor/status/1213665819357589504?s=20)

It's possible and perhaps likely that the report by Shams is being exaggerated, I recall something similar happening with the infamous Jimmy third stringers practice from last season. 

That being said, the videos [here](https://streamable.com/8ipc5), [here](https://streamable.com/jglyw) and [here](https://streamable.com/39j4f) in concert with Channing Frye's Twitter tirade against Collin Sexton and the organization at large [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ek7hcv/channing_frye_i_cant_do_shit_for_that_shit_show/) seem to paint a different picture."|kobmug_v2|False|https://redd.it/ek8j6b|1088|0.97|0|230|1|nba
ekvijt|2020-01-06 15:23:48|[OC] What would MVP Derrick Rose average today? (a different approach)|"We've seen countless ""How would MVP Derrick Rose be in today's league?"" posts, with most of the responses being wild speculation ""30/10 easilyyyy"" or ""hE DiDnT dEsErVe mVp would be a bench player today!"".

Instead, why not use **his current play** to predict his stats in today's game?

# Model 1: He would be exactly the same player he is today, but plays 36 minutes a night.

This is a ""lower bound"" on his projected production. Simply take his per-36 minute stats for 2019-20 season, and assume that, injury-free, he can play more than 25 minutes a night:

**Stats: 25.1/3.1/8.3 on 49/33/87 splits (as of today)**

&#x200B;

# Model 2: Same player as today, but with 2010-11 free-throw rate

The above line is not bad - and is likely an all-star season. Now, the biggest difference in Rose's game since the injuries has been the reduced aggression while driving. This is best evidenced by the sharp drop in free-throw attempts since the injuries. To account for this, let's keep every stat the same, except free throw attempts, which we'll scale up from 4.0 (this season, per 36) to 6.6 (2010-11, per 36):

**27.4/3.1/8.3 on 49/33/87 splits**

&#x200B;

# Model 3: He is 80% of the player he was

This is probably the most controversial one, as you can be a better player than someone putting up better counting stats. However, for the sake of completeness, let's establish this as an upper bound by scaling his current stats by 25%:

**31.4/3.9/10.4 on 49/33/87 splits**

This is an MVP-caliber season even in today's game.

What I didn't account for: improvement jump-shooting. For example, his three point shot may be improved with several offseason practicing instead of rehabbing. However, predicting shooting percentages is a crapshoot, so I assumed he would maintain his \[solid\] shooting performance from this season. In reality, I see his overall shooting splits being in the 50/38/87 neighborhood."|baselinefacetime|False|https://redd.it/ekvijt|3|0.52|0|12|1|nba

I don't exactly know how the NBA revenue system works, so I'm not sure if selling more seats adds to their bottom line, I'm from the UK so i'm not the most knowledgeable when it comes NBA.

That's what it looked to start the season, with the Thunder going 1-4 over their first five game, and though they split the next ten, it looked like a tough hole to climb out of.

But the Thunder have gone 12-3 over the last 15 games and are currently on a five-game win streak. 

Now, at 20-15, it looks like they may be playoff bound (though the season is long).  That puts them on pace to get about as many wins as they've gotten each of the past three seasons (47, 48, and 49 wins respectively). 

Anybody surprised by their performance? Though they have faced some sub-par teams in this stretch, and good teams struggling with injury, the wins are still impressive.

Both have disappointed with about the same record and have had surprising losses to below .500 teams (Sixers have lost to Wizards, Magic twice, Suns; Clippers have lost to Grizzlies, Pelicans, Spurs, Suns, Bulls)

Both have major additions to their starting lineup and with their tendency to rest players, have had limited number of games to play together. The net rating of the Clippers starting lineup is 7.4. Net rating of Sixers lineup is 7.3.

Both have a MVP-caliber star that needs to be load managed.

Both have had players recently speak up about frustrations  (Embiid after Rockets loss, “It’s taking a toll on me.”; Montrezl Harrell after Grizzlies loss, “We’re not a great team. [Locker room] may be another problem.”)

el0sgw|2020-01-06 21:38:18|since everyone has them, what are some big or small trade ideas that you think could help both teams?|"just some of mine firstly

Ben Simmons for Jamal and Grant. i think Ben gets to be on a team where there’s enough spacing that his game works more. Jamal gives the 76ers shooting and scoring, also they get Grant who can boost up their bench playing the 4/3 

Horford and Milton for Jrue and Kenrich. 76ers get a playmaking scoring guard who can also lock up. plus a solid 4/3 in kenrich. Pelicans get a very good big man who’s locked up for another 3 years 

Horford and Milton for Barnes and Belly. 76ers get essentially another tobias plus a great shooter in Belly. Kings get a player better than both of them, and he can help that defense a ton 

Horford and milton for Dragic and Olynyk. 76ers get another good guard who can score and spread the floor. they get a 4/5 in kelly who can space it. heat get another great defender and a Winslow/Jimmy/Horford/Bam 2-5 is pretty fucking tough on defense to score on down the stretch, or at any point really.. 

Tobias and Milton for Barnes and Bogdan. 76ers get Barnes who’s like 80% of Tobias? and then they get Bogdan who can be their 6th man and a guy who can spread the floor and shoot 3s. Kings get a better Barnes

i swear i wasn’t just picking on 76ers. they’re just very intriguing"|shanmustafa|False|https://redd.it/el0sgw|0|0.36|0|37|1|nba

eklcdk|2020-01-05 23:56:34|What players are better/worse than how the media perceives them?|"I’m genuinely curious to see what players get better or worse attention from the media. For example, I don’t think Kevin Love is as good as people say he is. He definitely still has value as a floor spacer, but he’s been atrocious on defense and has trouble scoring on anything outside of threes and little midrange bank shots. He’s still a really good player and a decent third option in mid tier team, but not really an All-Star anymore. He might make it because he plays in the East and has good numbers on a poor team, but I don’t think he’s as valuable as the media perceives him.

Are there any examples you guys can think of? Preferably if you watch them on a night to night basis."|phillipgeb|False|https://redd.it/eklcdk|12|0.76|0|56|1|nba
ekjth7|2020-01-05 22:08:41|[Not Serious] how interesting would trade of Ben Simmons + Al Horford for D’Angelo Russell + Draymond Green be?|"Obviously this is unrealistic and i doubt Philly would say yes but man the trade would be so interesting imo. 

Warriors: Curry, Thompson, random SF, Simmons and Horford lineup. 

Philly: Russell, Richardson, Harris, Green, Embiid. 

I think it would fix Phillys fit issues and Draymond is significantly younger than Horford to pair with Embiid (I actually don’t know which has the more value between Horford and Green given their ages and contracts). 

And I think Ben Simmons would be ridiculous paired with Curry and Thompson on the wing where he could play a more suitable point forward role like Draymond did for so many years. Plus they get the centre in Horford they’ve needed for years."|mantistobogganmMD|False|https://redd.it/ekjth7|15|0.59|0|115|1|nba

They might look good, but they are detrimental to the team. It might be their bad defense, lack of effort, bad decision-making, being a ball hog etc. Let's list these players. My top 3 picks are:

\-Collin Sexton (ball hog, poor decision-making)

\-Julius Randle (Lack of effort, maybe defensively the worst starter big men)

\-Hassan Whiteside (Lack of effort, even though lately he's showing a little bit of consistency)"|astini|False|https://redd.it/ekjg86|11|0.63|0|106|1|nba

AD has done it the last 4 times (2020, 2018, 2015, 2014). Before that it was Chris Webber in 1999.

Other instances:

David Robinson - 4x 

KAJ - 1x

Hakeem Olajuwon - 11x (!!)

Moses Malone - 1x

EDIT: If those numbers seem too cherry picked, I changed it to 20 PTS, 10 REB, 8 BLKS, 3 STL and it shows its been done 26 times with Joakim Noah and Ralph Sampson being added to the list.

Trae Young could have made history with the first 3 point buzzer beater but instead was blocked by Daniel Theis which would be his first ever blocked shot, and first game winning (sealing) block, also making history for the celtics, however they go into much more detail in the video about WHY this is so historic.

> ""The way I'm being guarded, I'm being doubled every time I have the ball and everybody crowds the paint, so it's kind of hard to just move the ball and just keep it moving and find ways to score,"" said Embiid, who scored 20 points on 7-of-17 shooting."|Nyhrox|False|https://redd.it/ejzkoe|1078|0.97|0|798|1|nba

Since taking Conley's spot, Ingles is posting 15/6/5 with a shooting line of 52/50/80 a huge improvement from his bench numbers|"They key to the Jazz turnaround has been the way the current starting 5 of Mitchell, Ingles, Royce, Bojan, Gobert feed off each other both offensively and defensively. 

Both Mitchell and Ingles are good ball handlers and can run PnR effectively with Gobert. For Ingles in particular this has improved his usage and efficiency by leaps and bounds. Off the bench Ingles was only posting 7 ppg with 30 percent shooting from three, mostly coming off catch and shoot opportunities because of the ball in Conley hands. 

Conley has also been TERRIBLE running the PnR with Gobert which has greatly hurt the team. 

Conley should be coming back to step into Mudiay's role playing only bench minutes with the likes of Ed Davis and Tony Bradley. 

He should no longer be a key factor for the Jazz. He should be relegated to bench duties (perhaps lie and just say he's hurt and sit him for season) and then traded in offseason as an expiring contract. 

He just doesn't fit with the Jazz he hurts them.

Perhaps they can try to deal him for Kevin Love if they want to include future 1sts and because he is going to soon be an expiring. But if not then just bench the dude he is not a fit in Utah.

I've tried searching on Google to no avail and from my searching, I can't seem to find data or logs on team bench points in a game (without actually calculating it). I feel like it'd be reasonable to expect it to be from a team with a very good bench (Clippers of the last couple years), but I have a feeling it could be a freak game where a star gets injured very early into the game.|BabyJ|False|https://redd.it/ekkfqb|4|0.64|0|4|1|nba

Have an extra person in a room with high end camera that looks at EVERYTHING on the Court to call fouls the refs missed.

It is an awesome NBA tradition that is getting worse and worse every year. Tacko Fall is currently 6th in eastern conference forwards voting, and Kyrie Irving is 2nd in Eastern Conference guard voting. What bothers me is the hypocrisy from the fans. Come February, every NBA fan is gonna have something to say about how the players don't take the game seriously enough, yet the same fans make a joke of the vote. These votes actually matter to these guys. These players dream about being an All-Star their entire life. So, when someone like Devin Booker sees that Alex Caruso has more votes than him it probably feels like a slap in the face. Hypothetically speaking, if Booker were to not make the all-star this year due to Caruso being voted in, (I know this wont happen due to the media vote) then why should he give a shit about the game if he were voted in next year?

ekcn7x|2020-01-05 12:51:54|Who should the Clippers be targeting for trades?|"They have a first that, along with Harkless's $11M salary, has got to be burning a hole in their pocket.

There's no reason not to try to turn those into a useful player who can upgrade their rotation, so my question is who should they be looking to acquire.

I've heard folks say that they should be seeking another wing (Iggy?) or a playmaking guard, but I feel their greatest need is a quality center (preferably a defensive one)

Would pursuing Dedmon be a good call for them since the salaries match and he seems done in Sacramento?

Tristan Thompson is another option if they were to attach just a little more salary (Zubac would be more than enough).

Or they could even get all the way to the Adams/Drummond level by cobbling a few other smaller contracts together.

Would a trade of Harkless, Zubac, Macgruder and their first for Drummond be something they should look into?

After the Knicks game, he remains the best in the league at 27.2% allowed, out of 302 qualified players.

Here's the weird anomaly - NBA.com tracks 6 different categories FGs defended by shot distance: overall FG%, within 6 feet of the rim, within 10 feet of the rim, beyond 15 feet from the rim, all 2-pointers, and all 3-pointers.  **Ayton has the best mark in the league in every single category**.

Ty Lawson and John Wall, the other two points guards who posted 8.8 assist a game that year had 3.2 and 3.6 turnovers per game respectively. 

But the Lakers waived him that summer. 

With the Bucks, Marshall was able to increase his 2pt% to over .500 and his FT% to nearly .900 while still hovering just above .390 from the arc.  But he saw limited minutes and was eventually traded to the Suns, who waived him before he was picked up by the 76ers, who gave him limited minutes in one of their tank-a-thons. 

He retired from basketball in 2017, and finished his education at his alma mater, where he worked as a student/coach and is now director of recruiting. 

&#x200B;

It's great to hear that he's still in basketball and earning a living doing so, but he was a guy who's passing skill and improved shooting made me feel like he was cut out for a long run, even as a rotation player. 

I really wish we could have gotten to see more of this guy, because he seemed willing to put the work in to improve his game and also came across as a genuinely good person. 

I only got to see a handful of game with the Lakers, and though that team (under 'Antoni) was playing absolutely no defense, his passing skills were at a point where even some of the most respected point guards don't get to after several years in the league."|NotADoctorFremulon|False|https://redd.it/ejx90g|335|0.93|0|90|1|nba

As a Raptors fan, I've always felt like they get less coverage in US media than other teams. r/nba on the other hand has always seemed to be more balanced in how teams are covered.

I was curious and wanted to play around with some data wrangling scripts so I created a pipeline for tracking team popularity on this subreddit.

The dataset above does the following:

* tracks posts from 11/01 - 12/28
* associates player mentions with their respective team (e.g. a post about Luka Doncic = a post about the Mavericks)
* Only considers posts that have 100 or more upvotes

Turns out there's a pretty linear progression of coverage based on team performance and star power of the top teams. It's nice to see the raptors slightly edge out the Bucks despite how hot the Bucks have been and Giannis's appeal.

Interesting to see that James Harden is that much more popular than Giannis and Kawhi.

Pacers and Nuggets fans...where you at?

If you're interested in the code/methodology for generating this dataset, I wrote a post with the python code [here](https://nikitagold.com/python/2019/12/28/reddit-nba-player-teams-classifier.html).

Clippers more so in need of a floor general to initiate an actual offensive rhythm.

ek86t6|2020-01-05 04:42:55|Which NBA team is the most depressing to currently be a fan of?|"Which NBA team is generally the bleakest or just not living up to expectations? Most of the preseason picks have given their fans some reason to hope. Hornets are unexpectedly not terrible, have an MIP candidate in Devonte Graham, and are sort of contending for the 8th seed. The Knicks are seeing a recent resurgence under Mike Miller, but may have been a clear answer to this question a few weeks ago. My Wizards were also a common answer at the beginning of the season, but with Beal signing an extention, Rui looking great pre balls kick, Wall looking to come back strong, and a new competent GM who's pulling a Masai with all of these random G-League Gems, we have reason to look forward to the future. 

Cavs might be the worst at this moment with heaps of locker room drama and vets showing no faith in their young players. But you could make an argument that they're not too far removed from 4 finals runs in a row and one of the most memorable rings of all time. Fans might still be able to bask in that Lebron afterglow. However, that's all in the past, and this current roster does not inspire hope.

The Blazers are in the 9th seed, seven wins away from 0.500, and 5 games behind the franchise Lillard supposedly ended last playoffs. Strictly looking at the roster, they have a shot to make playoffs, but some fans had expectations of another conference finals run with the league wide open this season. They're far below their expectations at the start of the season arguably due to injuries and likely won't ever make as much playoff noise as they did last postseason in the Lillard era.

After getting obliterated as a middling 8th seed last season, the Pistons aren't looking any better this season. Drummond is on the trade block and who knows if they've ruined the rest of Blake's career by playing him through injury. Expectations weren't too high for the Pistons at the start of the season but they look directionless as a franchise. 

The Timberwolves are on their way to completely wasting the early years of another exceptional big in KAT. After looking to be a playoff team earlier in the season with Wiggins playing at a borderline all-star level, they slipped a double digit losing streak in the mix and look well out of playoffs. Wiggins and KAT who have been hailed as ironmen have been missing games left and right. While Wiggins had a great stretch where he played with effort and much higher IQ than previously displayed, he hasn't been in the headlines lately. Even with an incredible talent in KAT, the fact that they haven't sniffed the playoffs without Butler might make their fans the most depressed. The weather can't help either.

My friends who are Knicks fans still aren't sold and are convinced that teams always play with a spurt of energy after firing a coach. Even though Miller just might get this team to play better than expected, Knicks are still cursed with arguably the worst owner in the league and a front office that has never done much to ease doubts. It might take a longer streak of good luck for Knicks fans to be optimistic about the upcoming years. 

The Hawks have the worst record in the league amidst suspensions and injuries. They do have Trae Young who would certainly be all over the headlines as a sophomore 21 year old averaging 28.5 and 8 on pretty good efficiency if it weren't for Doncic being the best player on a strong playoffs team. Instead, the teams defensive woes are being pinned on him as the ""worst defender in the league"" which overshadows his precocious offensive abilities. Hawks fans have to hope that they'll be able to hide Trae like the Celtics hid IT and let him be a superstar on the offensive end. Otherwise, poor team performance could cause the talents of an exceptional and unique young point guard to be wasted. 

I'm hesitant to include the Spurs because having a coach like Pop can always inspire hope, but it could be depressing to watch a roster that has a 0% chance at a ring desperately try to keep the playoff streak alive. Spurs fans have been spoiled with amazing talents in the past but don't have a clear path to contention unless they're able to turn another mid teens pick into a top 5 player again. 

I'm also hesitant to mention young teams like the Suns and Kings since they've also dealt with missing players, but the continued mediocrity of those two franchises could lead fans to doubt things will take a turn for the better. 

So, which team do you think it's hardest to be a fan for at this moment? Since I know I'll get comments saying ""I ain't reading all that chief"" from the Reddit comedians, in short I think the Cavs, Blazers, Pistons, Wolves, Knicks, and Hawks all have cases, as do the Spurs, Suns, and Kings.

&#x200B;

Some background information to Lillard's 3 point shot development:

>When  Paul George labeled Lillard's historic pull-up a bad shot, he probably  didn't realize just how much Lillard practiced those exact kinds of  long-range looks with his trainer, Phil Beckner.  
Like  a lot of NBA makeovers, Lillard's deep-3 project stemmed from  disappointment. Following a nightmarish playoff sweep by the New Orleans  Pelicans in 2018, Lillard was motivated to expand his range. The  Pelicans stifled Lillard with traps, and he needed new ways to get his  own shot against aggressive opponents. If Lillard could shoot from  farther out, he wouldn't always have to overcome double-teams and  blitzes to get looks from downtown.  
""We worked on deep ones in so many different ways,"" Lillard said.  
He  spent hours working during the 2018 offseason, putting himself through  intense drills that would eventually make game situations feel easier.  
""Shooting  it off the bounce, shooting them without jumping, shooting them with no  momentum, shooting them from a deep squat and raise up and shoot it,""  he said. ""You know, just uncomfortable positions but still trying to  shoot an accurate shot.""  
It  started with Beckner taping down a makeshift 4-point line in a Vegas  gym, about 4 feet beyond the NBA's actual 3-point stripe. Then the two  went to work engineering the NBA's most dangerous long-range system."|courtside_secrets|False|https://redd.it/ek034t|61|0.94|0|14|1|nba

Jaylen Brown, who was drafted one spot after Ingram, re-upped with the Boston Celtics for four years and $115 million. Buddy Hield, the No. 6 pick in that draft, got four years and $106 million.

This is a thread from November 2010. To put that time in context,  'The Decision' happened a couple of months ago and 25 year old Lebron plays in Miami, Kobe has already twopeated the Finals MVP, Andrew Bogut had recently made the All-NBA team and D Rose is going to be MVP this season.

**Some selected comments:**

This comments describes 'LeGM' before LeGM was even a thing.

>I wish he handled things differently, from his not signing a long-term deal initially, to what he said last year, to the decision. If he wanted to go, thank Cleveland for the good times, and say it is time to go. Nothing he said besides ""I'm staying"" would have gone over well, but he did the exact opposite of anything like that.

>It wasn't the Cavs fault, they tried getting everything they could for LeBron, signing whoever he wanted, firing coaches, etc. If the team was that horrid besides James, then why did they win 60+ games more than once.

In a long summary of why people hate Lebron, someone posts this:

>He said he'd bring a ring to Cleveland - Some 3 years ago he said he wouldn't go championship chasing, and would bring a ring to Cleveland. Well, I don't think Cleveland's management/coaching was spectacular, and i don't blame him for going. Also, 3 years ago he was like 22. Sometimes young (or not) people say stupid things they wish they could take back.

ek4nsp|2020-01-04 23:47:47|During the 2017 off season Kyrie Irving had requested a trade from the Cavs and as soon as he did multiple teams started to inquire about him which of one were the Milwaukee Bucks but it was the Boston Celtics who won the Kyrie Irving sweepstakes.|"A long, long time ago where the Milwaukee Bucks were still being coached by Jason Kidd and having there FO managed by John Hammond, Kyrie Irving requested a trade. 

During that time the bucks offered the Cavs basically anyone besides Giannis for Kyrie.

That included...

Khris Middleton a consistent 3 level scorer, who could create his own shot all while playing good defence and was on a bargain of a contract, a player you’d think would fit perfect next to Lebron.

Malcom Brogdon, coming off a ROTY after establishing himself as one of the younger veterans in the NBA, who also had a very nice 3 point shot, shot creating ability and incredible poise to his game all while playing good defence. Who was also still on his rookie contract. 

Thon Maker who recently broke out in the first round 6 game series against the raptors and at this point in time his trade value was at an all time high. 

Jabari Parker, who had tore his ACL and was in rehab but before was looking like an all star that was averaging 20 ppg. 

[Q1] My question why wouldn’t the Cavs have inquired with Milwaukee more about the pieces they were offering and if not why didn’t they take Milwaukee’s offer over the Celtics?

[Q2] How insane would a team or Kyrie Irving and Giannis have been? 

[Q3] How good would the Cavs have been that season &amp; how nice would Khris and Malcolm have looked playing next to lebron with the improvements they continued to make? 

Malcom Brogdon eventually became a 50/40/90 guy with the bucks and Khris Middleton became 20 ppg all star. 

A Cavs team with Khris and or Malcom definitely would have been better than the Cavs with IT and the Cavs with Clarkson, Hood."|curiosstranger|False|https://redd.it/ek4nsp|13|0.79|0|25|1|nba

ejvjcf|2020-01-04 11:21:53|Monte Morris is the first PG since the '50-51 season to have an 8 game stretch with 0 turnovers whilst averaging over 17mpg during the first 3 seasons of their career.|"He's accomplished this in Denver's last 8 games while mostly being the primary ball handler for the 2nd unit. I think it's pretty impressive and I'd love to see the streak continue. He's currently at approximately 148 mins played without a turnover. 

He's also currently leading the league in assist to turnover ratio at 5.5 per game.

He 14th on the last with Gary Clarke being 1st at 14 games without a turnover.

Turns out, it's [only Jaylen](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=23&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=pts_per_g&c1comp=gt&c1val=20&c2stat=fg3_per_g&c2comp=gt&c2val=2&c3stat=fg_pct&c3comp=gt&c3val=50&c4stat=fg3_pct&c4comp=gt&c4val=40&c5val=0&order_by=ws).  

I figure that's a little restrictive...

**Increase the age to under 27** and now [26 year old Durant and 24 year old Karl Towns' current season also qualify.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=26&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=pts_per_g&c1comp=gt&c1val=20&c2stat=fg3_per_g&c2comp=gt&c2val=2&c3stat=fg_pct&c3comp=gt&c3val=50&c4stat=fg3_pct&c4comp=gt&c4val=40&c5val=0&order_by=ws)

I realize this has a bias towards the modern NBA, because it wasn't always common for players to have at least 2 three pointers per game.  So if you **lower that to at least 0.5 threes made per game**, [22 year old Chris Webber, 24 year old Reggie Miller and 24 year old Kawhi Leonard now join the mix](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=26&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=pts_per_g&c1comp=gt&c1val=20&c2stat=fg3_per_g&c2comp=gt&c2val=0.5&c3stat=fg_pct&c3comp=gt&c3val=50&c4stat=fg3_pct&c4comp=gt&c4val=40&c5val=0&order_by=ws).

Lastly, I realize 50%/40% might feel a bit arbitrary.  To see who came close, I **kept the age to under 27 and lowered it to 19+ points and at least 48% FG and 38% from three while making at least 0.5 threes**... It's still fairly rare.  [It's only been done by 15 players. New additions are 23 year old Bradley Beal, 25 year old Cedric Ceballos, 26 year old Steph Curry, 26 year old Tobias Harris, 22 year old Brandon Ingram, 25 year old Kyrie Irving, 25 year old CJ McCollum, 24 year old Peja Stojakovic and 25 year old Ron Artest join the mix.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=26&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=pts_per_g&c1comp=gt&c1val=19&c2stat=fg3_per_g&c2comp=gt&c2val=0.5&c3stat=fg_pct&c3comp=gt&c3val=48&c4stat=fg3_pct&c4comp=gt&c4val=38&c5val=0&order_by=ws)

What if Harden has a 101 point game this season, breaking Wilt’s record, and averages 39/6/8 as the 2nd or 3rd seed, and Giannis averages 30/13/6 as a 65+ win team. Giannis would have the team record, but would the 101 point game be enough to give Harden the MVP?

I'm not a fan of Simmons but if he could play like this more often there's nothing stopping him from really being an MVP calibre player. I hope the media don't manage to twist this against him.

ek567w|2020-01-05 00:28:35|Using first-round picks to entice a team to not match an RFA offer sheet|"Last summer a few good RFAs completed sign-and-trade deals in which their incumbent team received a first-round pick (D-Lo, Brogdon).  

Had this specific occurrence ever happened before - a team receiving a first-rounder essentially in exchange for not matching on a desirable RFA, and facilitating the path to another team?

As a follow-up:  Let’s say the Pelicans discover they can get the Hawks’ top-5 pick this summer in exchange for sign-and-trading Brandon Ingram at his 4-year (25%) max.  Doesn’t everyone win in that scenario?  

The Hawks get their ideal free agent in terms of age and timeline with their core.  The Pelicans avoid losing their player without getting a return, stay within their payroll constraints and clear an obvious path for Zion to get the most touches.  And Brandon Ingram gets paid his max, becomes an Eastern Conference All-Star and joins a Hawks team that makes the playoffs.  

All of that makes more sense to me than the Pelicans maxing Ingram themselves, bumping near the luxury tax and still being an 8-10 seed.  

I think signing-and-trading good RFAs a trend we will see continue in the future."|notsellingjeans|False|https://redd.it/ek567w|3|0.72|0|15|1|nba
