I’m writing some sci fi and have become very interested Galactic interaction. I’ve begun reading a bit, but thought I’d post here and see if anyone has any links to current or ongoing research projects related to the basic physics and predicted outcomes of this phenomena. 

Im interested in every aspect of the cosmology but for writing purposes I’m specifically looking for physical mechanisms  that fictional agents (little g Gods, type iv+ civs etc) could use to manipulate the outcomes of these mergers, spin-offs and other movements. 

The Milky Way and Andromeda will begin an interaction in 4.5 billion years. What other interactions have been predicted within our local group?

ekx26j|2020-01-06 17:17:30|Hypothetical: emergency on the Moon with no functioning space suit|"Okay, hypothetical time.

You’re on the Moon in a habitat designed for long-term occupancy.  Some emergency happens that causes complete loss of air pressure, but not explosively so; you have no ability to reach a full pressure suit but you *do* have the time to reach a full-face air mask (like firefighters use) connected to a tank with many hours’ worth of air.  You’ve rigged the mask sufficiently tight to prevent air leakage.  You are wearing long, white clothing that will block you from direct sunlight.  It is daytime, and the sun is climbing.  You have hours of sunlight left.

The nature of the catastrophe is such that (won’t bother with details) you cannot salvage a pressure suit elsewhere, nor can you radio for help, nor are there surface vehicles to jump in.

There *is* another habitat on the Moon, if you can reach it on foot.  You can open the airlock from the outside without help from others and enter.

**How far can the habitat be and you still realistically make it on foot before dying either from lack of oxygen due to lack of external air pressure hampering your ability to breathe effectively from the tank, or overheating from sunlight despite your full-coverage white clothing?**

These are the things I think about on a day off."|FlorbFnarb|False|https://redd.it/ekx26j|2|0.57|0|25|1|space

The first aspect is based on modern science and theories of scientists and in another aspect we will understand time travel based on Hinduism texts.

eki9mi|2020-01-05 20:07:18|A few questions about astrophotography.|"Hey all,
I have a few questions about getting into astrophotography.  Currently I have a Canon Rebel T6, a cheaper telescope (I'm not sure exactly what it is but I know it's not ""top-quality"" one), and a T-Mount for my camera and telescope.  I know my way around the camera and how all the settings work together. My goal is to get atleast decent quality pictures of stars, galaxies, planets, and other objects. 

Here are the questions:

1. Is this goal possible with my current setup or will I be dissapointed?
2. Is there anything else that I may be overlooking that i sould get?
3. When someone says ""12 hour exposure time"" what exactly does that mean? It can't be a constant 12 hours of the cameras shutter being open, right?
4. What is the general process of this? How much planning goes into getting a picture of, say the Andromeda Galaxy?

I think that's all my questions for now.
Thanks in advance"|Jared246|False|https://redd.it/eki9mi|0|0.4|0|2|1|space

ekfzi3|2020-01-05 17:27:41|Spaceship can travel around the galaxy in 20 years according to Einstein's Theory of special theory of relativity|"Einstein's special theory of relativity makes it in principle possible to reach anyplace in the universe in the lifetime of an astronaut on board a spacecraft. The ship just has to go fast enough relative to Earth. According to what is called time dilation, a moving clock is observed to run slower than one at rest. In a related effect called Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction, the measured length of an object contracts in the direction of its motion. These phenomena, which defy our commonsense notions of time and space, have been amply confirmed in experiments and other observations.

Suppose we were able to build a spaceship that could accelerate at a constant one g, that is, at the acceleration of gravity on Earth, which would also nicely provide artificial gravity for the astronauts. That ship would reach Alpha Centauri in five years' Earth-time while only a bit over two years would elapse in shiptime. In eleven years' ship-time it could reach the center of our galaxy. But during that time, almost 27,000 years would have passed on Earth. In fifteen years' ship-time the astronauts could reach Andromeda, 2.4 million light-years away. By then, since most of the trip was at near the speed of light relative to Earth, 2.4 million years would have gone by back on Earth. After experiencing the passage of twenty-three years, the astronauts would actually pass the edge of the universe currently observable from Earth, but 13.7 billion years would have elapsed in the reference frame of a long-dead Earth.

And we’d still need to use some sort of cryosleep system to survive that long.

ej12id|2020-01-02 17:20:17|SpaceX will Take Cannabis to Space in 2020|" 

Yesterday and today, the [Elon Musk](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/) space company, [SpaceX](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/), has made headlines around the world for a successful new launch through [Falcon 9](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/).

It has been the third launch of this rocket, which has again successfully landed on its reuse, although in the process one of the two halves of its fairing has been lost.

Those responsible for the project have announced that they will try to recover it from the water in order to continue using it.

However, even if they failed, [SpaceX](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/) will continue to give much to talk about in 2020, as it already has a large number of releases planned, some of the most curious.

This is the case that is scheduled for next March, when the company plans to take 480 hemp and coffee plant cell cultures to the International Space Station, in order to check what effects its growth in microgravity has and if its properties are modified, for later use, both in space and back on Earth.

It will be in charge of doing the CRS-20 cargo flight, backed by [SpaceCells](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/) USA. Inc, Front Range Biosciences and the University of Colorado, as recently explained in a press release.

 

Experiments with sight in the future

The scientific evidence available so far suggests that plants in space can undergo numerous mutations.

This has led the researchers of the participating institutions to launch this project, whose objective is to verify to what extent they occur, how they affect them and if they remain once back on Earth.

The stay of these plant cells in space will last a month, after which [Front Range Biosciences](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/) scientists will analyze whether there have been changes in [RNA](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/).

The objective of this test is to check if the gene expression they had before undergoing these extreme conditions has changed. But what does this mean exactly?

Remember that [DNA](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/) is like the instruction book of an organism. All cells have the same code, but this is not read in the same way.

Depending on the function of each one, some instructions or others will be followed or, put in a more technical way, some genes or others will be expressed.

This is done through the conversion of [DNA](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/) to another molecule, called [RNA](https://www.wingsherald.com/spacex-will-take-cannabis-to-space-in-2020-elon-musk-tesla-nasa/), which will later serve to synthesize the necessary proteins at all times.

In short, what these experts are looking for is to check if space changes the way in which plant cells read the instructions of the plant.

These experiments have the objective of verifying how plants would behave in space, facing future colonization, both for scientific purposes and, why not, also for tourism. They would be necessary as ornamentation, but especially to help space travelers stay healthy during their stay.

But that’s not all, because it is also intended to check if the stress of this new environment can help plants synthesize chemical compounds that they would not normally produce.

No doubt a very interesting research field will be opened as a result of this trip. Paint well the science that is presented for this 2020."|jubair_bin_hasan|False|https://redd.it/ej12id|0|0.4|0|9|1|space

eid8gq|2020-01-01 03:18:35|Fermi paradox|"Hi, I have a question related to the Fermi paradox that has been in the back of my head for a while now. So my topic goes like this. We, scientific community, has been looking at the universe with a multitude of equations and intruments (eg. Find the type of atmosphere of certain exoplanets and their stars and all that stuff) for decades and everyday we use new methods that amaze me. We look at the universe and we didn’t find any complex life equal or better which lead us to think that we, Humans, are the only intelligent organism in the universe. The Fermi paradox goes with the idea that, with all the exoplanets that exist in the universe, we would have seen some form of clues of another complex civilisation (the Dyson sphere is a good example). An intelligent specie does not exist without leaving traces of them harvesting the power of their planet, star or even galaxy. But, we all know that light travels at a certain speed (approximately 300 000km/s) and when we look at a star that is, let say 2,5 millions ly away from us, we see it like it was, 2,5 millions years ago. So, why the Fermi paradox exists if we look always in the past and not in the present ? There could be millions of Dyson spheres out there in front of us, but we would have to wait millions if not billions of years to see the information (yes, light is information) of those Dyson spheres. We look in the past and maybe in this past the universe was not suitable for life to form or just that it didn’t appear in those times. Why scientists try to find clues about stars in other galaxies if they probably don’t exist anymore or are like millions or billions ly away from the positioning we currently look at them?

 - ability to MANIPULATE time like freeze it, slow it down, fast forward etc.
 - physical travel might be much faster than speed of light


2. Supreme beings (their incarnations)
 - ability to physically MOVE themselves through time,backwards or forwards
 - physical travel at around speed of light 


3. Bulk beings (highly developed humans/aliens)
 - ability to SEE through time, backwards or forward.
 - physical travel less than speed of light but more than speed of sound.


4. Human beings (Us)
 - No time related abilities. Can only use time as it is and maybe bend it a little bit. XD
 - physical travel less than speed of sound.


5. Primitive beings (what we were at the start of stone age)
 - same as human beings in terms of time.
 - physical travel at even less speed than that for human beings.



6. Thoughtless beings (what we were before stone age)
 - time usage simlar to that of both above
 - physical travel same as primitives


7. Fauna (aquatic worlds, dinosaurs, reptilian worlds etc)

Just thought this was really interesting and wanted to share.

From APOD website:

**Cassini Spacecraft Crosses Saturn's Ring Plane** 

**Explanation:** If this is Saturn, where are the rings? When Saturn's ""appendages"" [disappeared](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/18mar_saturn) in 1612, [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) did not understand why. Later that century, it became understood that [Saturn](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/)'s unusual protrusions were rings and that when the [Earth crosses the ring plane](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap950801.html), the edge-on rings will [appear to disappear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaTAYOpUP6o). This is because Saturn's rings are confined to a [plane many times thinner](http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/108-How-large-are-Saturn-s-rings), in proportion, than a [razor blade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor). In modern times, the [robot Cassini spacecraft](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/mission/spacecraft/cassini-orbiter/) orbiting Saturn frequently crossed [Saturn's ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040117.html) plane during its mission to Saturn, from 2004 to 2017. A series of plane crossing images from 2005 February was dug out of the vast [online Cassini raw image](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/raw-images/raw-image-viewer/) archive by interested Spanish amateur Fernando Garcia Navarro.  [Pictured here](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2005/05/31/saturn_sans_rings.html), digitally cropped and set in representative colors, is the striking result.  [Saturn's thin ring plane](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080720.html) appears in blue, bands and clouds in [Saturn's upper atmosphere](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap041102.html) appear in gold. Details of Saturn's rings can be seen in the high [dark shadows](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090901.html) across the top of this image, taken back in 2005. The moons [Dione](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121105.html) and [Enceladus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180701.html) appear as [bumps in the rings](http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=18340&p=230228#p230227).

Love to work on Mars & moon settlement design, any programs?|"There is nothing more I find more intriguing and have a passion for than space, but always followed and studied it as a hobby. I received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering as it was a field I also had an interest in, however, I realized why am I not following my passion for space and want nothing more than at this point than to get into the space field. I may be late and understand there is no real correlation between civil engineering and any space careers, therefore, I am here asking for any recommendations on careers in the space industry a civil engineer such as myself can branch into? Any recommendations of classes I should look into?

Within the coming years I am getting my masters in structural engineering and project management, as well as, my professional engineering license. I would love to get into the design aspect of the new Mars and Moon missions focusing on the settlements, with the infrastructure etc, but have no clue whether SpaceX, NASA, or if there are any companies or agencies that are embarking in this research or have a program in this type of field. Does anyone know if this exists?

Would appreciate any feedback on whether this is a pipe dream or I can make this a reality, thanks."|usaspacemans|False|https://redd.it/ei90gc|1|0.5|0|18|1|space

ehnyzl|2019-12-30 16:13:17|Bought the DS1 Planetarium for Christmas|"I have a three year old son that is just starting to get interested in space and planets and stars and all that good stuff. I was never big in astronomy myself, but thought it would be a good idea to foster that interest and get us a planetarium for Christmas.

Did a lot of research, and essentially narrowed my choice down to two: the Sega Homestar Flux and the DS1 Planetarium. The DS1 is obviously the superior one, but cost quite a bit more vs. the Homestar. I went back and forth with the owner of Miller Engineering (the company that makes the DS1), and eventually decided to go with it.

I ordered the planetarium, the chrome disc, and 5 additional star discs. Tested it out the day it arrived, and have been using it every other day since Christmas. I turned it on in my son's bedroom after storytime, put on some ""star gazing"" music, and just stared at the ceiling until he slowly drifts away. This is the most relaxing thing I've ever done in my home.

I never got the Sega Homestar Flux, so it's not fair for me to draw a comparison between the two. But I'm very happy with the DS1. The upfront cost is high, but the quality of the build makes me believe that the planetarium will lasts us quite a long time.

Overall, I cannot be happier with the product. Just thought I would share my thoughts as there were a distinct lack of reviews of the DS1 on the internet when I was doing my research. Hopefully I can help someone who was in my position make a more informed decision.

Here are some pictures that I took. Bear in mind, I took the pictures my my cellphone, and the room suffers some light pollution from the street lamp. Just want to show what it looks like in an everyday scenario:

eh51go|2019-12-29 11:39:27|Moon Day/Night cycle Visualization in VR|"A few months ago, my girlfriend (physicist) and I (VR prototyper) discussed the idea to build a simulation of the day/night cycle of the moon, with focus on the movement of the earth and sun in the sky. Part of the inspiration was this page: [https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-blogs/explore-night-bob-king/observing-earth-from-the-moon/](https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-blogs/explore-night-bob-king/observing-earth-from-the-moon/)

I don't claim the end result is very accurate - we did our best given the time, but there would be much more to do -  nor that the demo is particularly fun, but we wanted to share some videos:

[Fixed POV on the moon surface](https://reddit.com/link/eh51go/video/zk0ejfmiek741/player)

[VR version with flight near earth during the moon night](https://reddit.com/link/eh51go/video/y31sn114ek741/player)

The main things we learned doing this are:

* Keeping people entertained without cheating is hard. If you can't move around and interact with things, there's really very little happening on the moon. We wanted a comfortable VR demo, which mostly mean no camera accelerations that are not driven by the user movement, and we did not know how much space people would have so we went for a seated experience. At that point, the shadows of the craters and the earth spinning and ""drawing an 8 in the sky"" were the main attractions, provided that time would flow fast enough.
* In VR, a sped up simulation of the star sky can induce a lot of nausea. This was primarily due to having the moon horizon as frame of reference, and the stars rotating just behind it.

The demo is not published, but I can put together a build and share it if people are interested."|MementoMori000|False|https://redd.it/eh51go|9|0.78|0|1|1|space

ehhzqq|2019-12-30 05:51:00|The probability of other life in our Galaxy is so high so where are they? Our species is feeling lonely.|I think about our species a lot. We are complex intellectual beings capable of inter planetary travel. We can cure diseases and help other species of animals on our planet but here's where I feel things get kinda interesting cause we have done most of these things in only a couple hundred years. We are not even close to being an intellectual civilization on a cosmic scale. We are still babies on the level of a species and yet a few years ago we almost ended ourselves in the cold war. Here's when things get interesting our Galaxy has about a hundred billion planets alone. And out of those there are 40 billion planets in the habitable zone which means they are not too far and not too close to their star (the Goldilocks zone) and if we take it that out of those many potentially habitable planets only 0.1% had life which again is an assumption there would be 40 million planets with life on them and as our Galaxy is about 14 billion years old there is a very good chance that those planets have had potentially millions of years of advancement ahead of us. So where are they? Even if we take the Fermi paradox into consideration there should atleast be a type 2 civilization somewhere and if there is shouldn't we be able to detect it? I know this sounds childish to assume but if there was an advanced civilization would they even want anything to do with us? The very fact that we might never live long enough to see another species of another planet is honestly scary cause it kinda feels like a cosmic level of loneliness where all the other civilizations are almost ignoring us. Or maybe our methods of communication are too primitive for them to listen in to and just adding to that is the fact that we might be too small and insignificant for the other civilizations to detect us. It's scary but also exciting. Our lives may not be long enough to see them aliens but it's still fun to think about the probability of them existing.|palesssss|False|https://redd.it/ehhzqq|0|0.41|0|15|1|space

I found this particular image on [history.nasa.gov](https://history.nasa.gov). The earliest mention I found of this project I found was from 1973 in the Seattle Times:

>Senators \[...\] announced three NASA study contracts awarded to Boeing CQ.: $199,920 contract to continue studding methods of recovering Saturn first-stage rocket boosters or reuse \[...\] Contracts were let by NASA Marshall Space Flight center. (Seattle Times, 7//11,/63)

This is from a newspaper, so there are probably internal NASA memos on this from earlier; ima try find them (:

By '69 there are no mentions of this anymore - by then, the Shuttle was starting to be a thing. It's kinda cool, with SpaceX being considered so futuristic, that NASA looked into using a rocket's first stage over half a century ago.

So there's some stuff online about this, but none of it goes into much detail. There's probably more information available elsewhere - I have a lot of spare time and this seems like a fun research topic so I'll try find it. pm me with questions!

ega6fb|2019-12-27 11:38:14|Colonising Venus and Mars|"I think by making use of Gateway from NASA's Artemis programme, we could send rockets from the Moon to Venus to collect the large amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere when the Earth orbits close to Venus and send them back to the Moon. Since the rocket lands on the cloud bases which are in Venus' atmosphere, the gravity is weaker and the atmosphere thinner, making it easier to transport more gas using less fuel. Then when Earth orbits close to Mars send the carbon dioxide to Mars. If done enough times this could create a greenhouse effect that melts the Martian polar ice caps, releasing frozen water and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This creates an atmosphere on Mars that shields against solar radiation, making the planet more habitable. Since the Moon has such low gravity and no atmosphere, it requires less fuel to send cargo as compared to on Earth, making trips more fuel efficient. 

We could build cloud bases in Venus' atmosphere where the pressure and temperature are similar to Earth's. Also, install solar panels on the roofs of the bases to collect the large amounts of solar energy. Since we are collecting the carbon dioxide from Venus' atmosphere, this slows down the greenhouse effect. By breaking down the carbon dioxide to create carbon and oxygen and the oxygen is used for breathing and planting. By reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere we could slow down the greenhouse effect and cool the planet enough to make the surface of Venus somewhat habitable. 

Is this plan possible? It would probably take a very long time and a lot of resources but if done right could allow us to colonise Venus and Mars and possibly even terraform them."|meisfish|False|https://redd.it/ega6fb|16|0.69|0|18|1|space

SCRIPT:  


Carl Sagan once said, “We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.” We as humans could represent a problem maker species for the world ecosystem, but we are at the same time the only option for preserving life and consciousness in the long term. What if we expand life far beyond this tiny pale blue dot we call Earth, and what would happen if we don't do it. In this channel, we discuss the technologies that can potentially make us an interplanetary species. If you are a space nerd and tech lover like me, you are welcome to subscribe and activate the notification bell.

There are two ways to answer the question. The obvious answers, that appeal to the facts, if we don't do it all the life we know will disappear; and the inspiring answers, which are the ones that drive me on the most. Let's start with the obvious ones.

If our branch of evolution persists, it may well result in intergalactic civilizations of superintelligent beings that we cannot presently fathom. This sounds cool right; nevertheless, there are more reasons than you may know that can make this not to happen. Our present historical moment is a crucial juncture in the unfolding story of the universe. We now have the power to end all life on Earth. We possess thousands of nuclear warheads capable of occasioning an existential catastrophe. We are a fairly fragile global ecosystem relatively easy to collapse. Our being confined to this single planet means that a single asteroid collision or some other unforeseen cataclysmic event could wipe out our entire species, even all life on Earth. In 2008, a group of experts at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at Oxford estimated a 19% chance of human extinction before 2100. So, If a catastrophe does occur, how can we at least ensure that our evolutionary branch will persist? The obvious answer is making backups of life far beyond this planet. 

But, there are inspiring reasons to do it, related to the meaning of life from the perspective of the universe and our intrinsic adventure nature. Elon Musk, SpaceX's CEO and founder, once said, “You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great, and that's what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It's about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can't think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.” Vinay Gupta, a former senior scientist of the National physical laboratory of India, once said. “Making life interplanetary, and then interstellar enables creation to generate untold wonders over potentially trillions of years. We have no idea how long human life could last if we can get it off this one fragile, risk-filled, tiny sphere into the ocean of darkness and light above our heads, and every nook and cranny of the observable sphere. We owe all the potential futures that could emerge from our present the possibility of existence, and to accomplish this, we must go not only into space but eventually, by any means found necessary, into the stars.”

Gupta and Musk are at the forefront of a growing movement of thinkers and technologists who are advocating for a multi-planetary civilization. Given the increasingly precarious nature of our existence on Earth, this group has concluded that the first question we must ask ourselves is, how do we ensure the continuation of consciousness and life? I know, there are important things to solve here on earth. The global poverty, the refugee crisis, human trafficking, slavery, industrial farming, environmental crises, and so on; nevertheless, we must understand that those issues won't matter at all if life is swiped out for any of the potential threats. Think about that for a moment. If we don't become a multiplanetary society, more than trillions of potential humans, and living creatures will never come to exist unless we ensure the continuation for the preservation of consciousness and life.

We’ve already made significant advances in the domain of space travel. Our technological and scientific understanding continues to improve all the time. Given the myriad existential risks we’ve already identified and the numerous others that we likely have yet to identify, becoming a multi-planetary species is potentially an extremely urgent matter, and we must take this task seriously.  Even if there is a minuscule chance of success, the colossal stakes would seem to necessitate that we dedicate a certain portion of our collective time and resources to becoming multi-planetary.

efzb01|2019-12-26 18:56:29|How to escape light pollution?|"I've always wanted to see a real dark sky with hundreds of glowing stars, but I've never had the occasion to be in a really dark place during the late night since I live in an urban zone. 

For the holidays, my family and I are currently at a Mexico resort near the beach, and I've noticed that the nights here are dark enough to make me unable to count all the stars I see if I go on the roof of my hotel building

I would really like to be able to see the core of the Milky Way or the Andromeda Galaxy at least one time with my own eyes before we leave the resort, and I've noticed that there isn't any source of light near the beach of the resort. I went to the beach last night around 11 PM, but there were lots of clouds in the sky. Still, in a small part of the sky that didn't have clouds, I could see so many stars already.

I know that the best thing to do would be to litteraly take a boat and get far from the shore to really have the darkest sky possible, but I don't think it really is an option for me. For the next time that the sky is clear, I've thought of walking on the shore during the late night and getting the farthest possible from the resort's territory to avoid most light sources.

Do you think I would be able to either see the Milky Way's core or the Andromeda Galaxy in these conditions? What would be the best time during the night to see the darkest space objects?"|SomeKindOfSorbet|False|https://redd.it/efzb01|9|0.77|0|6|1|space

efmzkc|2019-12-25 22:45:36|Is a career in the space industry impossible for me?|" 

G'day from Australia

I hope everyone is making the most out of this holiday period.

About me:

I am an Australian second year EEE student and I am just wondering if a space career is completely impossible for me.

Context: I always liked to play with circuits since a young age and would often complete my practical work faster and to a better quality than my peers and I actually wish to be an engineer upon graduation, even taking an internship coding and testing drones for agricultural purposes in a small startup and I am an active member of my university's rocketry team and my university's space society.

However, I have a fail on my transcript in mathematics (what most of the American users here would call calculus 2) and a low cumulative GPA of 4.607 on a scale of 7 (2.633 on a scale of 4)\*. This is because I am not good at taking exams and most if not all universities in Australia enforce examination hurdles where the final must be passed in order to pass the course. As such, I doubt I will be able to obtain a masters or Ph.D which is a requirement for an EB-2 visa ([requirement](https://www.path2usa.com/eb2-visa)). As such, migrating to the US to work for SpaceX or NASA is almost an impossibility due to ITAR requirements. Just would like to know what my options if any are.

\*My post a few months ago on [r/engineeringstudents](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineeringstudents/) stated a ""cumulative GPA of 4.4 on a scale of 7 (approximately 2.5 on a 4.0 scale)."" This discrepancy is due to my latest results coming through. A total of 3 semesters have been completed."|justanotherstudentAU|False|https://redd.it/efmzkc|20|0.7|0|15|1|space

Inspired by [Ten years in space: Remembering a decade of achievements in the final frontier](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/efmo61/ten_years_in_space_remembering_a_decade_of/) post, I'd like to read about what space related research and development made it to our everyday life, and homes. We all read about science on ISS, working on new drugs, research on new materials, micro-gravity, work on Mars, probes discovering things, etc.  


But what does it really mean for average Joe or for average grandma?  


I expect we could distinguish 3 categories of such inventions.  

1. Those developed for maintaining and improving LEO missions, particularly ISS as the largest project.
2. Things that has been researched, and discovered in space (again I expect ISS to play main role) with non-space purpose.
3. Technologies made for other space related needs. This would be pretty wide area containing things involved in propulsion, energy production, telecommunication, long range surveillance, temperature management, probes' equipment, etc.

eezw6u|2019-12-24 10:50:35|Please tell me if my understanding of spacetime is correct|"Hi everyone,

Thanks in advance for reading.

May be this makes no sense at all but I have been reading about time dilation and relativity since past few days and here is my understanding of everything so far.

Things which have mass cannot travel at the speed of light. Things which have no mass can travel at the speed of light. Everything is made of matter. Matter is made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of sub-atomic particles like Proton, Neutron and Electron and they are made up of quarks. They all have masses so cannot travel at the speed of light. So practically nothing (NO THING) can travel at the speed of light.

Light was able to travel at its speed because it has no mass.

Gravity is a property of things. Things with mass have gravity. It could be small or huge, but things with mass have gravity. Gravity attracts/accelerates things in its field towards it. Gravity affects the rate at which particles interact or move.

The only constant we know for certain is the speed of light. Because we know this for sure we are able to observe time dilation aren't we?

Let's say I have an empty vacuum box of length equal to 300,000,000m as side length. I am making this assumption just to ease my calculations.

It is currently in front of me. So, let's say it is under earth's gravity. Since the speed of light is constant. If I shoot a photon from left to right. It would take one second for it to touch the right end in my clock. Cool.

\--------------------

**Question 1:**

So let's say, hypothetically, I shoot a photon from left to right and it hit the right end in 2 seconds in my clock. Does that mean the photon box in front of me is under stronger gravitational field and time is ticking slower down there. Technically let's say my friend is inside the box and he would observe that time it took for photon to hit the right end is 1 second. Because for him due to stronger gravitational field, everything, such as atoms and subatomic particles, is interacting slower and thus he would notice it as just 1 second in his clock.

So my understanding is gravity affects how things interact at subatomic level. We cannot tell that time is moving either slower or faster regardless of where we are. Because electrical signals in our brain also slow down and WE COULDN'T JUST TELL that something is slower. We can only tell that it is slow or fast if we are observing from a place (inertial frame?)  where the gravity is different.

**Question 2:**

This question could be batshit crazy.

If I were to put my head in this photon box will it get SMALLER? Because gravity bends space time?

Somebody who is next to me who is in the same gravitation field as I am, will they observe my head becoming smaller?

if I, myself, look back to my body will I notice my body to be BIGGER?

**Question 3:**

It could be same as question 1.

Time is not something that is constant. Like on earth we can say that Usain Bolt ran 100m in 10 seconds. But what is 10 seconds? It is just 10 ticks in the clock. What is that one tick? We don't know. We just felt it was convenient and started following it.

Fundamentally, time can be seen as rate at which things change at particle level. THAT'S IT? right?

\------------------------

I could run 100m in 20 seconds but that does not mean anything. The atoms and particles still act the way they do and interact the way they do at the RATE THEY DO. But if the gravitational is different, the particles starts acting at a different rate, slow or fast does not matter, it depends on the gravity.

The only thing we can use to measure this time dilation is LIGHT. Because it does not change and it is constant. Otherwise we would not be able to tell as our own brain cannot tell the difference because it itself is comprised of atoms.

In my mind

1. I am imaging spacetime as a three dimensional fabric. (Like a [high poly mesh](https://floorplanner557447880.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/wireframe-cube.png) of a cube in graphics) 
2. Gravity changes the rate at which particles interact. THIS is the main thing that I am believing.
3. The only way we can observe these curves in spacetime, time dilation and etc is by making use of the speed of the light. Because it is constant and unaffected by gravity.

Am I in the right direction in understanding relativity or I am completely off the track? :D

ef6goa|2019-12-24 20:14:27|Earth's Gravity ((ex. apple falling on earth )) and Black hole's inside pull understanding help|"I am by no means in the space study or field. So my question might seem totally stupid. But just curious.

If my understanding is right, black hole pulling everything ""into"" itself, is because, the outward force of black hole (( is there any name for it )) is very weak to balance out the black hole's inward pull (( is this correctly called black hole's gravity  ? )) , hence the black hole queezes everything and everything becomes thin and small etc etc.

How exactly is this different from what makes an apple fall on the ground ?. So since an apple falling on ground, isnt totally going like pieces and the life on earth is possible, so is there in any way an anology with the black hole's gravity ?  
Simply put, what is the threshold type like ""ok this inward force and outward force is ok, so apple can fall on earth, stay the same, humanity is possible "" vs ""this outward force is weak, the inward force is strong, hence black hole.""  
Can someone help me understand on those lines ? Or are my thoughts totally stupid and I am just watching too much of space documentaries."|johnreese421|False|https://redd.it/ef6goa|3|0.62|0|11|1|space

eequ0r|2019-12-23 21:24:57|I am skeptical that humanity will ever meet another space faring civilization|"Despite what ET, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Start Trek or The X-Files would like to me believe, I find it unlikely that there are many alien spaceships buzzing across the stars.

Yes, there universe is infinitely large, with almost infinite number stars and worlds.

Yes, I believe that life can happen elsewhere besides Earth, and it is quite possible that the universe is teeming with life and even intelligent life.

The problem is that terrestrial planets, that are non-tidal locked and placed in the habitable zone of a star seem to be extremely rare. It takes a quite perfect combination of conditions for terrestrial planets to be able to harbor life as we know it, and so far only Earth qualifies. What the universe seems to be full of are aquatic mega-worlds or ice planets with liquid oceans underneath the surface. Those are great places for life to develop, thrive and even become intelligent, and there seems to be lots and lots of such places across space. Hell, there are several of those right here in our solar system.

But because these places are mostly aquatic, you can have plenty of life and even intelligence life, but you cannot have fire or electronics. Without fire, you can't develop metallurgy, build tools, telescope, radios, rockets, etc... So you might have a highly intelligence species that is simply not able to develop technology, because they simply lack the means to do so.

Another thing to consider - Aquatic life in mostly aquatic worlds will probably have terrible eyesight (if any at all), relying instead on sonar, smell, tact or something similar. That alone would represent an incredible challenge in terms of space exploration. How can one become aware of stars and therefore explore them, if you can't even see them?

So if this model of life supporting terrestrial planets being quite rare and aquatic and ice worlds with oceans being common, it means that the universe might be full of Intelligence life that are forever trapped within their own planets, and that humanity will be mostly alone when travelling across the stars."|cambeiu|False|https://redd.it/eequ0r|15|0.6|0|53|1|space
