Reasons they should Have? 

Moat Cailin: 

It is the chokepoint on the Kingsroad Causeway, which could easily be destroyed from the north, preventing the weights from crossing. It’s also surrounded by hostile swamps that wights would have a difficult time crossing 

Harrenhall:

The castle is immensely large and thus would have a harder time being overrun. It also has enough space to take in refugees.

ek3u90|2020-01-04 22:46:17|[NO SPOILERS] I need some help before I get into GOT|"Be warned, long post incoming...

So I've recently decided that I want to try watching Game of Thrones sometime soon. Problem is, I'm deathly terrified of angry/attacking dogs (dogs just hanging around being nice are good boys to me), and I know for a fact that GOT has some... interesting encounters with some character's direwolves, such as one of them eating the fingers off of a dude in one episode. 

So, and this may be too broad of a question to ask, but are there any superfans out there willing to help me out by telling me which episodes the direwolves attack people in? I know it's a ridiculous question, to ask someone to go through every single episode and check whether a dog nips at someone or not, but everytime I see something like that in a video or gif or whatever it causes me to almost have an actual panic attack, and I dont want to disregard the entire show just because of some dumb fear of mine. If anyone is able to help, that would be lovely.

Notes:

-I'm fine with the direwolves just hanging around, barking, and growling, it's only when they actually attack a person/thing that scares me (I understand that ghost and the others are good boys and girls, it's just my stupid fears)

-I dont need timestamps for the episodes, I just need the episode number (season number would be nice too lol)

-I'm not planning on skipping these episodes, just simply fast forwarding these instances, but I like to know which episodes have what so I dont fast forward every single scene with them in it"|Dr_Richard_Ew|False|https://redd.it/ek3u90|2|0.5|0|21|1|gameofthrones

Re-visiting the investigation in Jon Arryn's murder, and now knowing who caused it(from the show), has me asking questions about Baelish's motives. 

We learn that Baelish convinced Lysa to poison her husband and forge a letter to her sister Catelyn offering the idea of murder with the Lannisters' implication. Subsequently, this essentially propel's the entire conflict of the series, eventually starting the Stark v Lannister war which branches out into the war of the Seven Kingdoms. 

Jon Arryn requested a book on the Lineage of the Families of the Seven Kingdoms, because we find out he was inquiring about King Robert's bastards, and the parentage of his supposed children with Cersei. It's revealed that he had found the truth about Jaime & Cersei, and intended for the King to be notified. I can no doubt see how that would have serious ramifications to the Lannister family and their quest for power. 

I fail to make sense of why Baelish didn't want this information released, and used this time to get rid of Jon Arryn? Why side with the Lannisters, the most powerful family in the Kingdoms, who would be much more difficult to remove from power when he has his own agenda? Surely with knowledge of incest, Robert would have had Cersei and Jaime executed. His love for Catelyn is echoed much throughout the show, and how he failed so many times to win her over, having his life spared in a duel with Ned's brother Brandon, only to lose her to Ned. We see in a conversation with Varys(?) in the Throne room that he mentions something about his intentions along the lines of (I may misquote this)""what we all seek"" while he glances up at the Iron Throne. My theory was this, however it has holes and I struggle to make sense of it, hence why I've come to the Reddit Encyclopedia of GoT:

He knew Ned would be named Hand, and subsequently investigate and find the truth of Jon Arryn's murder and the Lannister children himself, leading to his execution/banishment to The Wall. This frees up yet another opportunity to wed Catelyn, his only love and who he believes was his rightful wife. With Robert and Ned dead, It creates conflict between the Starks and Lannisters, and with the Vale in his pocket, as well as the Northern houses behind him since becoming Warden of the North if he were to get what he wants in Catelyn, he overthrows the Lannister rule in order to sit atop the Iron Throne with Catelyn by his side, which would no doubt be his greatest satisfaction. 

This show really takes a dump on my brain sometimes. I hope someone can help me out here."|PizzaParker62|False|https://redd.it/eik0n7|1085|0.95|0|130|1|gameofthrones

- Question: *""With serialized shows, there is so much pressure on the finale. People’s opinion of the last episode can color how they feel about the whole series. How important is it to you that the final episode sticks the landing?""*

- Weiss: *""We want people to love it. It matters a lot to us. We’ve spent 11 years doing this. [...]""*

-

Casey Bloys (HBO’s programming president), September 2017, https://www.insider.com/game-of-thrones-hbo-filming-multiple-endings-leaks-spoilers-2017-9 : *""I know 'Game of Thrones,' the ending, they're going to shoot multiple versions so that nobody really knows what happens. You have to do that on a long show. Because when you're shooting something, people know. So they're going to shoot multiple versions so that there's no real definitive answer until the end.""*
___
February 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86VjgW1wDfI&t=62s (1:02 - 1:33) :

- Maisie Williams (Arya): *“I heard this and I thought, ‘I don’t think we got the budget to shoot multiple endings.”*

- Jimmy Kimmel: Casey Bloys made that statement.

- *“But as we know, sometimes presidents don’t always tell the truth,”* Williams quipped.

___
Maisie had a point. Why waste money shooting fake scenes that you are never going to air? Especially when you didn't even plan to include those in the Season 1-8 DVD Collectors Edition.
___
November 2019, Kristofer Hivju (Tormund), https://winteriscoming.net/2019/11/19/game-of-thrones-star-alternative-ending-kristofer-hivju-isaac-hempstead-wright/, reigniting the topic: *“Well, we shot an alternative ending. That was mostly for fun but I don’t know if I’m allowed to tell you about that.”* 
___
Spolier alert, he wasn't. Hence HBO sending their Lord Commander to the rescue:
___
Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister), December 2019, https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/nikolaj-costerwaldau-game-of-thrones-ending-amazing-a4317836.html : *“There was never an alternative ending.”*
___
Nikolaj was right. There was never any alternative ending to Game of Thrones, there was only one ending: **the real ending**. The one that **airs this Winter, starting March 15, 2020**.   
___
HBO, 2020 promo, https://www.instagram.com/p/B6HaNfMnFsR/ (0:34 - 0:37): right before ""Coming in 2020,"" Drogon breathes fire with the saying *""It's only just begun.""*

**The Table Read**
-

Lena Headey, February 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMGNoug7QKw&t=1s (0:00 to 0:18): *""We had a giant read-through with the cast and […] I think pretty much everybody cried at one point.""* 
___
Francesca Orsi (VP of Drama), March 2018, https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/game-thrones-spin-offs-will-be-big-budget-gate-1094135 : *“[The table read of the last few episodes with the show's cast] was a really powerful moment in our lives and our career. None of the cast had received the scripts prior, and one by one they started to fall down to their deaths. By the end, the last few words on the final script, the tears just started falling down. Then there was applause that lasted 15 minutes.”*
___
Yet, in the 2019 Last Watch documentary, when Bryan Cogman said *""End of Game of Thrones,""* we didn't see any thunder of applause: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6qSAncsuO8&t=266s (4:26 - 4:37). The 7 second clapping sequence was tedious at best. And only Kit, who hadn't read the scripts, was truly emotional. Emilia did shed a little tear during the read-through, but aside from a few members, the rest of the cast didn't seem particularly phased.
___
Francesca also declared: *“[...] none of the cast had received the scripts prior;""* but in November 2018, James Hibberd reported, https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/01/game-of-thrones-final-season-ew-cover-story/ : Kit Harington (Jon) and Liam Cunningham (Davos) were the only cast members who did not read the scripts ahead of the table read. 
___
So were Lena and Francesca lying and exaggerating for marketing purposes? Or could it be there was another set of scripts that were presented during the read-through? One that would see both cast and crew applaud for 15 minutes after reading the last few episodes.
___
If this was the case, Headey and Orsi's quotes would turn out to be true word per word. 
___
We thought that Francesca lied because we knew most of the cast had read the scripts ahead of time. But Francesca wasn't lying. The scripts they hadn't read weren't season 8 scripts, they were season 9's. And just like she said, one by one, they fell down to their characters' death and burst into tears.

**The Biggest Season Ever**
-

April 2019, https://ew.com/tv/2019/04/09/game-of-thrones-season-8-showrunners-interview/ : 

- James Hibberd: *""You told me back when filming season 3 that you were thinking of doing the final season as three movies because you couldn’t imagine pulling off what you and George had in mind on a television budget. Do you feel like you’ve been able to do what you envisioned years ago?""*

- Weiss: *""Yes. To their credit, [HBO] put their money where their mouths are — literally stuffed their mouth full of million-dollar bills which don’t exist anymore. They said, 'We’ll give you the resources to make this what it needs to be, and if what it needs to be is a summer tentpole-size spectacle in places, then that’s what it will be'.”*

___
Dan and Dave have said on multiple occasions that they were worried about the ending growing out of proportion for a TV budget. Yet, the reality is season 8 only cost $90M to produce: https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/21/much-game-thrones-season-cost-make-9622963/. While certainly high, this figure is still 10% less than season 6 ($100M), and a mere 12.5% increase over seasons 4 & 5 ($80M each). 
___
So what was there to worry about? Were Dan & Dave that scared to ask for a 10% budget cut for season 8?
___
As always, the devil is in the details; March 2019, Business Insider, https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-season-8-90-million-budget-6-episodes-2019-1 : *""Now we've gone from $6 million an episode back in that first season to almost more than double that with $50 million for these final six episodes.""*
___
Let us rephrase. In an article entitled: *""'Game of Thrones' season 8 has a $90 million budget [...];""* opening with: *""they're spending an average of $15 million per episode;""* Business Insider reported that the budget for the final 6 episodes of the series would be around $50M. The information was shared twice in the column: once by the interviewee, then a second time by the interviewer. 
___
Which means there were only two possible explanations: either D&D are delusional Emmy winning writers worried about asking HBO for a pay cut, and neither Senior Reporter Kim Renfro nor the HBO representative paid any attention to what they said and wrote in an interview that appears at the top of Google searches for 'GoT season 8 budget'; or, these people were telling the truth.
___
Season 8 really had a $90M budget, but there was another season being shot in 2018: season 9. And it is these final 6 episodes that required a total of $50M (~ $8.5M per episode), not the 6 episodes from season 8. 
___
This would explain why the showrunners were so worried about funding their ending. What they needed wasn't $90M, they were asking for $140M at once!
___
Hence Dan saying ""[HBO] put their money where their mouths are — literally stuffed their mouth full of million-dollar bills."" 
___
___
___
**Acting or Real?**
-

Once we understand this, every piece of information falls into place, every actor interview goes from over-exaggeration to genuine:
___
Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, April 2019, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5prr_YVSnc&t=136s (2:16 - 2:30) : *""When we read the final 6 scripts, I just thought: 'Wow, they've done an amazing job, they've actually [...] wrapped it up'.""* 
___
It wasn't that Nikolaj was particularly easy to dazzle or that season 8 somehow subverted his expectations; it was the final 6 scripts that left this impression on him, the ones from season 9. 
___
Kit Harrington (Jon Snow), January 2019, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TeIucK7yj8&t=249s (4:09 - 4:21): *""I'm so excited for people to see [the ending]. I think it’s going to be extraordinary, hopefully it’ll change TV again like it did originally, and break boundaries. I think it might.""*   
___
February 2019, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=751ae5QcCbQ (2:50 - 3:10): 

- PopBuzz: *""If you could describe the season finale of Game of Thrones (meaning season 8's finale) in one word, how would you describe it?""*

- Kit Harrington: *""Disappointing.""*

A feeling shared by many people: https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/game_of_thrones/s08, https://www.imdb.com/list/ls042685733/, https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/game-of-thrones-creators-bad-writers-on-google-search-2019-5. 
___
While Kit was right in saying the season 8 finale would be unimpressive (at first), he still thought the real ending would be extraordinary. And just like he said, season 9 would push the boundaries of what we thought possible.
___
Bryan Cogman, November 2018, https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/01/game-of-thrones-season-8-story/ : *“It’s an incredibly emotional, haunting, bittersweet final season, and I think it honors very much what George set out to do — which is flipping this kind of story on its head.”* 
___
""Emotional, haunting, and bittersweet:"" feelings that we had yet to experience in season 8, let alone flipping this kind of story on its head. In fact, season 8 did the exact opposite, embracing every trop of the fantasy genre along the way, as well as every TV series' cliches.
___
Liam Cunningham (Davos), October 2019, https://watchersonthewall.com/maisie-williams-isaac-hempstead-wright-liam-cunningham-michele-clapton/ : *“As regard to the end, [...] I think we had the most happy ending that we could possibly have. The Starks are in good shape. The Lannisters are gone. Daenerys –the Targaryens– finished. The Small Council at the end is mostly good people; it’s Brienne, Samwell Tarly, Davos, Bran, Tyrion. It’s a pretty happy ending for something that’d had genocides up to that point.”*
___
Ramsay Bolton, s03e06: *""If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.""*
___
Liam tried to warn us: be wary of happy endings in Game of Thrones. 
___
Cunningham, January 2019, https://www.todayfm.com/podcasts/today-fm/liam-cunningham-knows-exactly-how-game-of-thrones-ends : *""You can’t tie this story up with a bow, it’s not that kind of story… the ending will be bittersweet, so prepare for bittersweet, whatever that means.""*
___
___
Peter Dinklage (Tyrion), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5prr_YVSnc&t=215s (3:35 - 3:53): *""There are no better writers in television than Dan Weiss & David Benioff. They've ended [the show] brilliantly, better than I could have imagined. People are in for it.""* 
___
Peter Dinklage (Tyrion):*""[The ending] brings everybody into it. And what we thought. And it questions everything. Which I love. It really makes you question yourself. [...] And not in any sort of snarky way. In a beautiful way.""* - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7febtALCX7k&t=92s (1:32 - 1:53).
___
And he added, https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/game-of-thrones/game-of-thrones-season-8-ending-finale-tyrion-lannister-peter-dinklage-hbo-a8573936.html : *“I think it’s going to be the best season of television anyone has ever seen. It takes you to a place that you never saw coming [...],""*
___
Dinklage wasn't kidding. Season 9, the last season of Game of Thrones, takes you to a place you never saw coming. And it really makes you question how quick we can be to jump into easy conclusions. 
___
Aidan Gillen (Littlefinger), February 2019, https://www.irishecho.com/2019/02/gillan-project-recalls-50s-uneasiness/ : *“I’ll be watching [the show] the same way that everybody else will be watching it — weekly — except for that week they don’t show it and I’ll be saying, ‘Why are they taking a break halfway through the season?'”*
___
Even Aidan added fuel to the fire by letting the audience know there were 6 more episodes to come. But being the devil that he is, Baelish baited us into thinking these would air one week after s08e06, in the form of a season 8 - part 2. Which never made any sense, given how long post-production would take for 12 episodes. Hence part 9 of this series of posts, introducing the possibility of a s08e07 on June 2nd (see *""The Night King's Last Dream – Season 8 Episode 6,""* https://redd.it/bqw2aq).
___
S01e07, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAOsC-Fa6Yo&t=276s (4:36 - 4:43): *""I did warn you not to trust me.""* - Littlefinger
___
You'd think we would have learned after after seing Ned Stark being betrayed by the devil. Still, there was some truth to Aidan's words.

**An Impossible Schedule**
-

Now, you understand why the crew complained so much about the schedule:
___
May 2019, The Last Watch, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gddTawHoNFc&t=268s (4:28 - 5:09):

- Interviewer: *""Is this the hardest season ever?""* 

- Crew: *""By a long shot. First, schedule is impossible. The season is very big, it's written very big. But it's all this business of trying to do film finishes on a TV schedule, and on a TV deadline. And I think this season, we've certainly found the limits of what's able to be achieved. And insofar as I think now everybody realizes Game of Thrones has to finish because it just cannot get any bigger. You know, there are a lot of fried nerves walking around, myself being one of them [...]""*

___
September 2019, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T68xtQUi8lM&t=157s (2:37 – 2:55), Weiss: *”Thank you to the hardest working crew in the show - crews in show business. [...] You are amazing, all of you, and it's amazing that all of you are still alive.”* 
___
No wonder the cast and crew were impossibly drained, they had 2 seasons to shoot at once, in less than a year.
___
On its own, season 8 took over 10 months to film: https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/game-of-thrones-season-8-filming-cast-belfast-northern-ireland-a8016546.html; http://fortune.com/2018/07/09/game-of-thrones-season-8-filming-ends/; with actors claiming they shot for 11 months, twice as much as any other season (hence 2 seasons). 
___
But while s08e03 & s08e05 were undeniably exhausting to make, without season 9, there was no reason for the cast to be under such pressure. If we looked at season 8, we had run-times of: 54 mins + 58 mins + 4 X ~80 mins = 432 min = 7 hours and 12 mins. That is, 2 hours 50 mins less than the average season of GoT (excluding season 7). And according to the actors, they had twice as much time to record this shortened season. So what was all the fuss about?
___
April 218, https://wikiofthrones.com/15490/game-of-thrones-season-8-filming-begins-dragonpit-italica/ : *""[...] The filming on the Dragonpit set located near Seville has begun. [...] [it] is expected to go on here from April 23rd, to May 19th. [...] and the stars are supposed to join the filming by May 3rd.""*
___
Which meant the cast had 16 days of filming to wrap up the Tyrion trial scenes for s08e06.
___
Yet on May 2019, Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran) declared, https://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/season-8-episode-6-finale-isaac-hempstead-wright-bran-interview : *""The dragonpit speech scene itself was five days of filming.""* 
___
So, if the Tyrion scenes took 5 days to shoot, what were they doing for the next 11 days?
___
They were filming another Tyrion trial, one that was long overdue for the witty Lannister: his final trial. These last scenes, airing in season 9, would see Tyrion answer for the crimes of freeing both of his siblings (Jaime in s08e04, and Cersei in season 9 [see ""Gold Lion"" - Yeah Yeah Yeahs, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0XWeyOZxI8; & ""Listen to the Lion"" - Van Morrison, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWX-4eDxdDs; from D&D's endgame playlist]). 
___
Everything we thought we knew from season 8 was only half of what was being filmed in 2018. 
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T68xtQUi8lM&t=157s (2:37 – 2:55), Weiss: *”Thank you to the hardest working crew in the show - crews in show business. The Dragons who shot for 70 nights straight in freezing Belfast rain, the Wolves who shot all around the world. You are amazing, all of you, and it's amazing that all of you are still alive.”*
___
Pay attention to what Dan said during his speech: *“The Dragons […] shot for 70 nights straight […].”*
___
Strange, since we knew from many sources that s08e03, ""The Long Night,"" only took 55 consecutive nights to shoot: https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/game-of-thrones-everybody-hated-filming-the-long-night.html/. So where were those 15 days of extra content? What were they needed for?
___
These scenes were about the Night King waking up from his s08e06 Dream of Spring, and making his comeback in Winterfell (see part 9, https://redd.it/bqw2aq, *""The Night King's Last Dream;""* and part 12, https://redd.it/ef4xgd, *""Old Kingsroad""*).

**The Titanic Hangar**
-

James Hibberd, November 2018, https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/01/game-of-thrones-final-season-ew-cover-story/ :

- *""Arriving at the studio gate [in Belfast], I’m halted by a guard [...]. Along with an HBO escort, I walk inside an enormous hangar that’s so large it’s where the RMS Titanic was painted.""*

- *""What’s being filmed here is episode 6, the series finale. [...] I look around at a meticulously constructed set that I’ve never seen on the show before. Several actors are performing, and I’m stunned: there are characters in the finale that I did not expect. I gradually begin to piece together what has happened in Westeros over the previous five episodes and try not to look like I’m freaking out.""*

- *""There is absolutely nothing more that can be said about that scene at this time.""*

___
According to the journalist, a scene from the series finale was being shot in a meticulously constructed set that he had never seen before, one involving characters that he did not expect. 
___
However, after watching s08e06, reading the scripts and going through every deleted scene from season 8, it was safe to assume such a sequence was never meant for the season 8 finale. 
___
When we thought of meticulously constructed sets in episode 6, there were only two that came to mind: the streets of King's Landing, i.e. a miniaturized version of Dubrovnik; and the gigantic set of Winterfell. Both located outside the Titanic hangar. Which meant that scene couldn't have involved any of those areas. 
___
Besides, neither Winterfell nor King's Landing revealed any surprising character. The only time a casual viewer saw characters he would not have expected in s08e06 was during the Dragonpit sequence: the one including Lord Yohn Royce, Lord Robin Arryn, and the unnamed Prince of Dorne. And since the Dragonpit was located in Spain, it couldn't have been this scene either (because the RMS Titanic hangar is in Belfast). 
___
So did our journalist, a former writer for Amnesty International Magazine, lie? Or was there really a scene being filmed for episode 6, the series finale?
___
One answer that would tie things together, without discrediting Hibberd, would be for James to have witnessed a scene from s09e06, the series finale. One involving characters so unexpected that anyone would have been stunned: see part 12, https://redd.it/ef4xgd, *""And Then Some More.""*

___
**Comic Con 2019**
-

While Dan & Dave didn't make an appearance at Comic Con 2019, James Hibberd and the cast still left some clues.
___
The few people attending were very relaxed/light, not what you'd expect from a final farewell from the biggest show on television. The host, Hibberd, poked fun at plot holes in season 8 episode 6: pointing out how Arya's ending didn't make sense since Bran could simply tell her what was West of Westeros; questioning why Grey Worm wouldn't kill Jon; and why Snow didn't simply tell everyone Drogon killed Dany. The funniest part was the actors didn't really answer those questions. Which suggested: ""It was bad writing. What else can we say?""
___
Also, pretty much every main character was missing from the panel, so you could tell something was wrong. What kind of serious show attending Comic Con wouldn't take a single question from fans? Certainly not one that had a prequel in development and 3 other potential successor shows in the pipeline.
___
However, the most noticeable absentees were Dan & Dave, dropping out 2 days before the event: https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-game-of-thrones-creators-just-changed-their-mind-ab-1836466574. Most people assumed this was a cop-out. But if you read the article, it was said the pair was forced to remove themselves from the panel due to “production and scheduling conflicts.”
___
Now that was strange. Last time we had checked, season 8 was over and D&D were hunting for a new development deal, https://winteriscoming.net/2019/07/26/david-benioff-d-b-weiss-new-deal-decision/#, and they certainly weren't working on Star Wars either (https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/29/game-of-thrones-david-benioff-db-weiss-exit-star-wars-trilogy.html).
___
So why ""production conflicts?"" Were they simply lying? Or could it be they were busy producing another set of episodes?
___
Then came the panel:
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM03N0Jlxno&t=233s (3:53 - 4:00), James Hibberd: *""Perhaps the biggest question on the show was: who would end up on the Iron Throne? And the closest answer to that question ended up being Bran Stark.""*
___
The host repeated this same sentence in the EW rehearsal prior to Comic Con, which drew smiles and laughs from the cast: see first video on this article, https://ew.com/tv/2019/07/24/lost-game-of-thrones-ending/.
___
The *""closest answer""* to who would end up on the Iron Throne was Bran. Which meant Bran wasn't the real answer, only the closest. Someone else was supposed to sit on that throne by the end of this series.
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PEsR1fdGTA (0:01 - 0:26):

- Varys: *""When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?""*

- Petyr Baelish: *""It's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.""*

- Varys: *""A man with great ambition and no morals... I wouldn't bet against you.""*


Neither would we (see *""A Martinesque Ending,""* https://redd.it/8i9lzc).
___
So was it simply a mistake? Or was this a hint carefully planted by the journalist?
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM03N0Jlxno&t=279s, Isaac Hempstead Wright (4:39 - 4:54): *""I can't imagine [King Bran's] government is a barrel of laughs. It's probably quite serious.[...] To all intents and purposes, Westeros is now a surveillance state, with Bran aware of everything everyone is doing.""*
___
And https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1152338065966292992/pu/vid/640x360/IEcJncZVL4aC5YAY.mp4?tag=10 (0:34 - 0:45): *""I don't really think [Bran] has got too many ideas. He just kind of sits there and listens to what everyone else says and... just chills out.""*
___
There you have it. In case there were any doubts, Isaac is repeatedly letting you know Bran is a terrible King. And HBO, the actors, the publicists, the writers, everyone involved were completely fine with actors bashing the ending.
___
Now, what is one of the main reasons Martin started writing A Song of Ice and Fire? To respond to Tolkien presenting Aragorn as a good King (see *""It would be a Sin to Kill a Mockingbird,""* https://redd.it/8do7v7).
___
So we have: Isaac telling us Bran is a terrible King; Martin profusely praising D&D for their faithful adaptation of his novel series; and Martin starting ASOIAF to let Tolkien's readers know what a good king should be like.
___
Guess one answer that doesn't involve all of these parties being liars? Having another season that would present the real ending.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM03N0Jlxno&t=1380s (23:00 - 24:52): *""[...] I think it's quite cool that [the ending] is left slightly ambiguous [...] I think that's one of the cleverest things about the ending: that it doesn't conclude everything very neatly. You don't have these sort of set endings and you can sit back and go: 'right, well this happened to them, this happened to them.' It's left totally open. The Kingdom is in total disarray. [...] Bran is King. They are storylines that could warrant their own spin-offs, but they're left... They're not finished. There's no full stop. [...] It's almost as if the world of GoT exists still, somewhere in the ether. [...]”*

___
Remember what Martin, the showrunners and the actors said before the start of season 8? That the end of GoT & ASOIAF wouldn't be an open ending. And what was Isaac confirming at Comic Con 2019? That s08e06 was an open ending.
___
So once again, we were left with two choices: either these people were all lying; or s08e06 wasn't the end of GoT, only a dream of spring.
___
Notice how no one ever claims Martin said Bran would be 'King of the 7 Kingdoms,' only that he would be 'King:'

- Isaac Hempstead Wright, May 2019, https://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/season-8-episode-6-finale-isaac-hempstead-wright-bran-interview :  *""[Creators] David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] told me there were two things [author] George R.R. Martin had planned for Bran, and that was the Hodor revelation, and that he would be king. So that’s pretty special to be directly involved in something that is part of George’s vision. It was a really nice way to wrap it up.""*   

- Benioff, Emmys 2019, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A95Y6qebrCo&t=230s (3:50 - 4:00): *""It was always gonna be Bran as the King at the end.""* 

___
Bran was always going to be King at the end, but never King of the 7 Kingdoms. He would become the King of the Night, i.e. the unbeatable Night King (see *""The White Walkers: An unheard voice,""* https://redd.it/89plsa). 
___
Liam Cunningham (Davos), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM03N0Jlxno&t=2597s (43:17 - 44:22): 

*“It was a very strange thing. There’s very few jobs that you go onto where they’re hands deep, where everybody on the set is wonderful at their jobs. We have these beautiful words that we were handed by George, David and Dan and you’re working with these incredibly proficient and precise crews.""*

*""There was a kind of magical sense off it. It’s very, very rare that something comes along that feels almost gorgeous and every day it was just a pleasure to go to work.""*

*“I will miss the elegance of it and working with people at the absolute top of their game [...]”*

**A Good Story isn't a good story if you have a bad ending**
-

GRRM, September 2019, https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/9901145/george-rr-martin-lord-of-the-rings-amazon :
___
Drawing attention to the LOTR plot holes, Martin told The Sun: *""It's one of the great books of the 20th century, but that doesn't mean that I think it's perfect, I keep wanting to argue with Professor Tolkien through the years about certain aspects of it. He did what he wanted to do very brilliantly but… I look at the end and it says Aragorn is the king and he says, 'And Aragorn ruled wisely and well for 100 years'.""*
___
He continued: 

*""It's easy to write that sentence, but I want to know what was his tax policy, and what did he do when famine struck the land? And what did he do with all those Orcs?*

*""A lot of Orcs left over. They weren’t all killed, they ran away into the mountains. Did Aragorn carry out a policy of systematic Orc genocide? Did he send his knights out into the hills to kill all the Orcs? Even the little baby Orcs?*

*""Or was there Orc rehabilitation going on. Trying to teach the Orcs to be good citizens. [...]""*

___
That's a good point George.
___
Now let's look at the ending Dan & Dave provided, which Martin has praised profusely (see *""And Ending,""* http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2019/05/20/an-ending/). Do we have any idea what Bran's tax policy would be? How would he do when famine struck the land? Did he show any interest in politics throughout the series?
___
There is no way to tell since Bran never expressed any interest in politics. The latest political maneuver we were shown was Bran letting half(?) the population of King's Landing getting roasted by Dany so that he could be crowned King. If s08e06 was the ending, even Aragorn committing systemic Orc genocide would barely make him worse than Bran. And according to Isaac Hempstead Wright, the young King had no idea what he was doing: ""Bran just sits around and listens to other people's ideas and propositions.""
___
___
In an interview given to Japanese media, D&D said, https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-game-of-thrones-showrunners-have-finally-broken-the-1837796497 : *“[...] In Persian rugs, it’s tradition that you make a little mistake when making the rug, because only God can do anything perfect,”* Benioff joked.  
___
Even if Dave was joking, the implication was that season 8, although not perfect, is outstandingly good TV & good writing.
___
At this point, you could brush this quote off by thinking the showrunners were delusional and would only see coffee cups and episode 3's lighting issues as valid criticism.
___
But listen to the last extensive interview they gave before season 8, https://ew.com/tv/2019/04/09/game-of-thrones-season-8-showrunners-interview/ :

Hibberd: ""With serialized shows, there is so much pressure on the finale. People’s opinion of the last episode can color how they feel about the whole series. How important is it to you that final episode sticks the landing?""

WEISS: *""We want people to love it. It matters* ***a lot*** *to us. We’ve spent 11 years doing this. [...]""*

BENIOFF: *""From the beginning, we’ve talked about how the show would end. A good story isn’t a good story if you have a bad ending. Of course we worry. [...]""*

Q. ""What is the scene you’re most proud of in the whole series?""

WEISS: *“[...] I hope it will be a scene in this season. It’s nice to go out on your strongest notes.""*

___
So, getting the ending right matters a lot to the showrunners. A good story isn't a good story if you have a bad ending. And they hope to end on their strongest note. All very reasonable thoughts.
___
Then, in the same interview, when asked:

Q. ""When the final episode airs, do you have any specific plans for what you’ll be doing?""

WEISS: *""We’ll be in an undisclosed location, turning off our phones and opening various bottles.""*

Q. ""Won’t you be a little curious? I know you’re not big on social media, but you won’t be tempted at all to look at Twitter?""

WEISS: *""At some point, if and when it’s safe to come out again, somebody like [HBO’s GoT publicist Mara Mikialian] will give us a breakdown of what was out there without us having to actually experience it.""*

BENIOFF: *""I plan to be very drunk and very far from the internet.""*

___
See the contradiction? Most of the interview was Dan & Dave emphasizing how important it is to have a good ending and them anticipating the final season to be their Persian rug. But when talking about s08e06, they were always aware people wouldn't like it. Hence them hiding from interviews and from the Internet.
___
So where was this supposed ending they were so proud of? And what was this scene that had potential to outclass Battle of the Bastards?
___
I say it had yet to air, along with season 9.

**Emmy Awards 2019**
-

In the words of Peter Dinklage (Tyrion): *""This is all a blur,""* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A95Y6qebrCo&t=263s (4:23 - 4:37).
___
Game of Thrones could never end without Martin appearing in at least one shot of the TV adaption of his magnum opus. Especially when he had had time to participate in every other convention, including the Emmys.
___
It is my belief that the reason Benioff and Weiss were so confortable being evasive with the media was because the show wasn’t over. This is why actors were willing to protect their show runners at the 2019 Emmys, hiding them from the spotlight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A95Y6qebrCo&t=80s [1:20 - 1:45], look at Dan's movements in the background. This is why the crew gladly answered controversies directed at the writers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A95Y6qebrCo&t=437s (7:17 - 8:14), Kit stepping up at 7:17. And this is why everyone had been light and dismissive when it came to criticism, even months later. Always giving the same answer to anyone who would ask: ""You are disappointed because the show is over and you wish it went on a little longer.""

___
- Kristian Nairn (Hodor), https://www.psychobunny.com/pages/kristian-nairn-men-of-mischief: *“I don’t think the criticism [season 8] received was deserved, [...]. My only qualm was that I felt that it could’ve been a little longer [...].""* 

- Emilia Clarke (Daenerys), October 2019, https://www.cnet.com/news/emilia-clarke-opens-up-about-the-game-of-thrones-ending/: *""[...] you're sad that the show is done and you're sad because you enjoyed watching it, [...]""*

- Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2476840/the-game-of-thrones-cast-finally-addressed-the-ending-blowback: *""[...] Obviously it comes to an end, it’s gonna piss you off no matter what. Because it’s the end.""*

___
Which was a nice way of hinting that there would be more Game of Thrones.
___
___
Now listen to what Weiss had to say about the legacy of their program: *""[...] That's not really up for us to decide what people feel about [the show]. We hope that they watch it and like it in the future and we hope it holds up. [...] It's so gratifying to have reached this many people and we hope that people that are a little bit too young to be watching it now will grow up and learn about [...] it and watch it as well;""* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A95Y6qebrCo&t=130s (2:10 - 2:48).
___
Notice how Dan emphasized the future. He hopes the whole story holds up in the future. Because as of now, the series isn't complete, therefore it doesn't hold up.
___
When asked about controversy, after a moment of hesitation, Harington stepped forward, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A95Y6qebrCo&t=437s (7:17 - 8:14): 

- *“I’ll take this one… What was it? Controversy. I still haven’t seen the show. That’s how I dealt with that controversy. I haven’t seen the final season [Everyone laughs]. But I know what it took to shoot it. And it was — it was hard and everyone put all of their love and effort into it.""*

- *""And controversy, I think for us — we knew what we were doing was right story-wise and we knew that it was right for the characters because we lived with them for 10 years. And I think that kind of set — controversy for us didn’t really affect us. [...]”*

___
Kit was letting us know that story-wise, the series of events we witnessed in season 8 made sense. But the truth is no matter how hard you spin it, season 8 doesn’t make sense on its own. There were too many plot-holes and too many inconsistencies, these could not be explained solely by what we saw on screen if this was the end.
___
And here is the acceptance speech from which the “over” quote was derived:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T68xtQUi8lM&t=157s (2:37 – 2:55), Weiss: *”Thank you to the hardest working crew in the show - crews in show business. The Dragons who shot for 70 nights straight in freezing Belfast rain, the Wolves who shot all around the world. You are amazing, all of you, and it's amazing that all of you are still alive.”*

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T68xtQUi8lM&t=178s (2:58 – 3:10), Benioff: *”These last ten years have been the best years of our lives. And for everyone who worked with us on it, I can't believe we finished it. I can't believe we did it. We did it all together, and it's over. And we shall never see her like again.”*

___
In this sentence, Benioff's words could have been referring to the show being over. But it could also have been referring to filming, production and post-production being finally over, 5 months after s08e06 first aired (which wasn’t the case in August, at Comic-Con 2019).

-

Now, if there is indeed a season 9, the final question becomes: when does it air?
___
Here, we have to rely on HBO leaving some clues along the way.
___
On November 25 & December 2nd, HBO posted: *“Winter is coming for House Stark""* (https://twitter.com/GameOfThrones/status/1199075741616488448, https://twitter.com/GameOfThrones/status/1201526116680437760); meaning the White Walkers are coming for House Stark, and particularly for Bran, who had been marked by the Night King.
___
This message was quickly followed by tweets promoting the release of the complete series on Blu-ray & DVD, on December 3, https://twitter.com/GameOfThrones/status/1199373751223083014 ; which prompted the audience to assume that's all there was behind it.
___
But on December 21, HBO went back at it, posting their latest tweet to date, https://twitter.com/GameOfThrones/status/1208430189371363330 : *""Winter is here.""* 
___
*“More details, more devils.”*  ― George R.R. Martin, A Clash of Kings   
___
Except Winter 2019 didn't begin on December 21, it started on Sunday, December 22! Which means Winter wasn't here. Winter was still coming... For House Stark.
___
Now, given that Game of Thrones airs on Sundays; and that The Outsider, a 10 episode mini-series based on Stephen King's bestselling novel, also airs on Sundays, starting January 12 (with a back to back episode); the 9 PM slot will be full until March 8, 2020. And keeping in mind Winter 2019 ends on Friday, March 20, 2020; we are left with one possible date for the season premiere of Game of Thrones: **Sunday, March 15, 2020**.
___
Brace yourselves, for this ending is not something one expects from a television series. It is complex, surprising, yet incredibly clever and realistic.
___
Emilia Clarke, May 2018, https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-05-06/game-of-thrones-season-8-ending-will-make-some-people-go-huh-warns-emilia-clarke/ : *“People will scream and people will say, ‘That’s exactly what I wanted.' And some people will go, ‘huh?’ – my mum, probably.”*

And it won't be just Emilia's mom:
___
Liam Cunningham (Davos), April 2019, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7febtALCX7k&t=50s (0:50 - 1:00): *""If we come around and present the end of this show with a nice pink ribbon on it and go: 'There you go. Everything you wanted'; People will just shout you, patronizing, [...]""*,

**The Viewer's Heart In Conflict With Itself**
-

George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones: *“Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.”*
___
Four centuries ago, many people believed the heliocentric solar system was pure heresy, which is why Galileo spent the last decade of his life under house arrest until the day he died. And this was only after confessing he did not believe in heliocentrism to be let off with a lighter punishment.   
___
Nowadays, you'd be considered a heretic not to think the Earth revolves around the Sun.
___
8 years ago, most people believed Jaime was the spawn of evil. Yet in season 7, viewers cheered for him as if he was Ned Stark, despite knowing about his crimes.
___
And by the end of season 8 episode 6, you would be labelled delusional not to think Dan & Dave were bad writers.
___
But what happens if we were wrong? What if there was indeed a season 9 that tied all these lose ends together?
___
Had it been the 17th century, 1.8 M people wouldn't have had the opportunity to know since they would have had Dan & Dave imprisoned or burned alive before seeing the full picture: https://www.change.org/p/hbo-remake-game-of-thrones-season-8-with-competent-writers .
___
Through this gigantic writing effort, Martin's goal is to help us realize truth can sometimes be more complex than our mind is prepared to believe, burying itself under a veil of simple answers. This is why he has created characters such as Jaime, Melisandre or Littlefinger; so that we would experience how quick we can be to judge people and events and how wrong our understanding of it all can get.
___
But with seasons 7 & 8, Dave & Dan have elevated this mantra to another level entirely. By taking advantage of the media they operated in, i.e. television, they went beyond the small screen and made us question our judgement over real people as well, namely themselves.
___
By sliding in a few more plot holes than necessary, and by making absurd statements in Inside the Episodes, the showrunners baited us into thinking they had turned into some of the worst writers in television:

- Daniel Weiss, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3M0Xt97aFI&t=2107s (35:07 – 35:22): *“It is very possible that the same thing that created the Night King is the thing that was necessary to destroy the Night King. Maybe it’s Valyrian steel or… figure it out for yourself! Not gonna say.”* 

- Benioff, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8K9XuPrXko&t=351s (5:51 - 5:53): *""While Dany kinda forgot about the Iron fleet;""*

- Finally, they went all out with episode 5's Inside the Episode, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W8j6wOvxuo : talking about the siege of King's Landing, flags, implying Dany turned mad because Jon refused to lay with her, etc.

___
By this mean, they sublimated a story about the 'human heart in conflict with itself' to a journey about our own heart in conflict with itself.
___
With season 8, not only did we get to experience how accurate our understanding of fictive characters was, but also how easily skewed our judgement over real people could get:

- Have Bran in the Night King build a strong plot armor for our heroes in s08e03, https://redd.it/bkzyrj;

- Have Varys drug Dany into madness in s08e05, https://redd.it/bonbil;

- Have Bran dream of a Stark happy ending in s08e06, https://redd.it/bqw2aq;

And half the audience would turn against you. Not taking any time to wonder how casual viewers could notice blatant mistakes that none of the experienced crew working on GoT or at HBO had been able to correct (not even the most obvious plot holes).
___
And if you listen to the showrunners' interviews from earlier seasons, you'll realize they had been disappointed by TV shows on many occasions.
___
David Benioff, 2016, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7jKJqu4pUg&t=305s (5:30 - 6:55): 

*""We've been working towards that end for so long. And again, it was part of the original pitch to HBO, more than 10 years ago: what we think we have an opportunity to do here is tell a long, epic story, with* ***a real beginning a middle and an end.*** *[...] Even the TV shows that I've loved in the past, every season, you kinda got the sense that they were making it up a little bit again. They got in the writers room, a lot of smart people got together again and they are like: ""OK, what's gonna happen this year?"" And with very few exceptions, breaking bad is an exception, where it felt like [the showrunner] had a real plan from the beginning, with very few exceptions, that was the case. So we wanted to try to tell a massive story on the only possible canvas which is television. You can't do a 73 hour movie. Thank god.""*

___
They always knew what they were doing. They had witnessed the decline of every other show on television towards the latter seasons, so they mimicked some of it to convince us all they had lost it. And of course, we'd jump into believing it, thinking it was just like every other show we had seen before. While in truth, there had always been ""a beginning, a middle and end"" to their story; since the day they first pitched to HBO 13 years ago, with the support and approval of Martin. A man that would rather see his series unfinished than have 3rd hand writers put pieces together to try to finish his work. Such a man would have been very vocal had D&D's ending been anything less than what he had envisioned.
___
GRRM, April 2019, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjDentEr9c4&feature=emb_logo&t=33s (0:33 - 1:24): *“I don’t think Dan and Dave’s ending is going to be that different from my ending because of the conversations we did have [...]. The series has been extremely faithful compared to 97% of all television and movie adaptations of literary properties. [...]""* 
___
People love to jump to conclusions and look for easy answers, so a good chunk of the viewer base were quick to write off Emmy winning writers and producers of a show that had revolutionized television; thinking they were witnessing another show's abrupt decline into bad writing (Lost being a prime example of this, against which Martin has spoken on a couple of occasions).
___
But say what will about Lost and any other popular series that fell short towards the end, they tried. The decline was steady and drawn out. You could see it coming seasons away. So much so that I never made it to the final season of most of these iconic shows.
___
Natalia Tena (Osha), August 2019, https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a28634462/game-of-thrones-natalia-tena-season-8-disappointed/ : *""The calibre of writing towards the end and the plots and everything that happens and how they wrapped it up [in season 8] compared to any other season, any other bit, it just feels like it's been written by different people. It doesn't make sense [...]""*
___
Natalia said it best. Yes, there were questionable decisions being made here and there from season 5 to season 7 (at first glance), but nothing on the scale of what was about to unfold in season 8. Nothing could prepare you for the abrupt letdown that was s08e04 to s08e06, not even the first 3 episodes of season 8. As soon as Arya stabbed the Night King and erased 8 seasons of White Walker build-up in 5 seconds, the writing fell into the abyss.
___
Hence the disappointed fans. Season 1 to season 8 episode 3 set the bar so high that it created expectations. Therefore, when season 8 subverted those expectations by ending the show on a low note, it was a perplexing outcome to process.
___
May 2019, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0Dx7tPjl-4&feature=youtu.be&t=14s (0:14 – 0:49): 

- Dan Weiss (0:33 – 0:49): ***“Often, the best stories are the ones that are both completely surprising in the moment, and then in hindsight have an air of inevitability about them, and that was what we were going for, for the final season.”***

- David Benioff (0:14 – 0:33): ""This is what we've all been waiting for, from the people who create the show to the people watching the show. It is the culmination of this grand story that we've all been part of, that started in the beautiful mind of George R R Martin and that is ending [...] here on our screens.""

___
With the simple answer of s08e06 being the end of GoT and Dan & Dave being bad writers, we had to brush off so many inconsistencies: actors exaggerating a lot in interviews; HBO executives lying left and right; teasers from seasons 6 to 8 making no sense; GRRM not appearing in the TV adaptation of his magnum opus, while finding time for every other interview, yet profusely praising the TV series; some of the most talented people working on the GoT crew not being able to correct mistakes and inconsistencies larger than boats (see s08e06, https://redd.it/bqw2aq); on top of Martin's book ending making no sense at all.   
___
Whereas with this alternative yet complex denouement, every single one of these clues fit together. And after the Night King wakes up from his Dream of Spring and everybody dies in season 9, earlier teasers take their full significance:
___
Season 8's 'aftermath' becomes a very fitting title, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwmAWOE5F9o : 

- 2 Lannister relics : (0:19 Tyrion's hand) ; (0:37 Jaime's hand);

- 2 Targaryen relics: (0:40 Daenerys's chain) ; (0:46 John's sword);

- 2 Stark relics: (0:22 Arya's sword) ; (0:34 Bran's wheelchair).

All of these items symbolize main characters that are dead by the end of this series.
___
Season 7's teaser, showing GoT characters living inside the eye of the Night King, also takes a new meaning, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq0B0NVKghA : S08e06 was Bran in the Night King's dream.   
___
Besides, was there ever a chance for Martin's 30 year long response to Tolkien to be: ""A good King should be like Brandon Stark, not like Aragorn."" That is, a teenager with no experience nor interest in politics, whose few political decisions lead to: Theon capturing Winterfell; Jon running distant from his most important ally, Daenerys; and 500,000 people being burned alive in King's Landing; while he patiently sat around, knowing he'd be crowned in the aftermath.
___
It's up to each of us to decide what we are prepared to believe.

Hello everyone,

First of all, I'm not trying to say that season 8 is a good season. A lot of bullsh\*t happened during those six episodes, but I don't think that the battle of winterfell is among them. And here is why.

A lot of people blame the poor battle tactics used to fight the army of the dead (the cavalry charge of the dothraki, the ballistae, the trench and most importantly the fact that they don't use the castle as a defensive advantage). But I find their battle tactic rather intelligent actually. Just hear me out, it's true that hiding in the castle and defend it would be a very smart thing to do against a regular army who has the advantage of numbers. But most people forget that the night king had a dragon at that point, and as we saw in episode 5 of season 8, dragon fire can literally explode stone walls. In other words, if they would have grouped up with all their forces inside winterfell, the night king would have breached the walls very easilly and they would have been trapped and overwhelmed in a matter of minutes. Instead they chose to hold their ground outside of it and they tried to hold of the army of the dead as long as possible with a massive cavalry charge while Daenerys and Jon tried to locate and eliminate the night king before they reach the castle. It seems like a logical plan to me. But then again, I'm not a war tactician. Maybe my own logic is completely stupid. I would like to hear your thoughts about this."|Thibinus|False|https://redd.it/ej252z|3|0.6|0|30|1|gameofthrones

If he survived, the only confrontations would be with Dany as well as the Night King. There would be a whole lot of nothing in the seasons waiting for their arrival.

However on the other hand, those seasons of ""nothing"" would have a whole lot of Robert Baratheon in them. Even nothingness is extremely entertaining when he is on the screen.

eiq6e6|2020-01-02 00:13:20|[SPOILERS] My Own Ending for Cersei/Jaime/Brienne/Arya & Jon/Dani|" 

I know it's a bit late just rewatching the season and can't help to imagine a better ending and i just wanna share it.

I believed that Cersei, jaime, Brienne, Arya, Clegane & Mountain where deeply connected with each other.

Here is my own version what happened during Dani's Attack.

Arya disguises himself as Euron to kill Cersei but Jaime Saves her, Arya & Jaime fighting until Brienne Arrives and needed to chose between Duty (arya, she promised to catelyn to protect her/ and they all want to kill cersei for the war to stop) or Love (jaime)... She chooses to fight jaime since she is a Knight, Jaime vs Brienne (emotional fighting since they love each other). Arya almost reached cersei but the mountain arrives. epic battle between Mountain & Arya ( david/goliath style). Arya lost, she's about to be killed by the Mountain but brienne saved her, it means she won over jaime (just injured). The mountain was able to hold Brienne, Cersei ordered the mountain to finish her. Brienne dies. Injured arya was about to get killed by the mountain when clegane arrived. Clegane & mountain got separated because the castle is being torned to pieces by dani. So they can have their own cleganebowl just like in the original.

So it's just Cersei, Injured arya & injured jaime. Cersei was about to kill Arya while saying she will blow up the kings landing to kill everyone to kill dani. Burn them all (mad king style). But Jaime Killed her and became the queenslayer. 180 Redemption for Jaime from"" Killing a Stark for Cersei"" to ""Saving a Stark by Killing Cersei""..

For Dani & Jon, after jon killed dani. Drogon brought Dani to essos. Dani got ressurected by the Red priestess. Dani attacked kings landing with Drogon, Dani's Army vs Arya w/ packs of wolves of nymeria, sansa commanding the army. Jon w/ rhaegal (warged by bran) . Epic Dragon fight (In the Morning so we can see everything),  Full stark power vs dani. Jon loses and fell in kingslanding, Dani is about to kill jon. she saw how children where frightened of her and how she destroyed the city. She realizes she became the tryant she was fighting all her life. She left jon alive and they returned to Essos. She saw how people loved her in essos. Jon became the king of westeros while dani in essos.

 Jon & Dani finally talked for peace.  Drogon burned the Iron throne and started the democracy. People will vote for the next king/queen. While dani proceeded  in annihilating the slavery in essos.

in this ending, Jon's claim to Iron throne had more meaning, he became king.

Dani, became evil but redeemed herself. She returned to essos where she truly belongs. Just like her valyrian ancestors, She started to restore the old valyria and drogon layed new eggs.

then everything is almost the same, tyrion as hand, sansa as warden of the north, arya exploring. but bran(instead of jon) decided to go north with children of the forest and became a full pledged three-eyed rave to oversee that the world will maintain it's peace."|noctiszaoldyeck|False|https://redd.it/eiq6e6|0|0.43|0|7|1|gameofthrones

A great and complete victory, yet he allowed Shae to speak as a witness after his confrontation with Jaime.

Now the point: it was clear that letting Shae tell all those lies would make Tyrion desperate and upset, that would invitably cause him to say something very compromising, as indeed happened.

Why did Tywin risk so much and eventually have to break his deal with Jaime (we also know that he lost something more)?

eictnv|2020-01-01 02:38:14|[No Spoilers] Some of the treatment against Sophie Turner and her character is absolutely disgusting!|"It is absolutely ridiculous that she gets so much hatred from the crazy part of the fandom like the Daenerys stans who constantly bully and threaten her just because of a character that she plays. It's like some of those people are so dumb that they can't understand the difference between a character and an actress. She is not her character! And even so, the hatred that antis give to Sansa doesn't even make sense since she is a great, complex, well-developed character. A character that despite all the abuse that was thrown at her for the first five seasons, she never lost her compassion for others and her willingness to help others. Especially when all she wanted to do was protect her family, her people and the North's independence and freedom. It just cracks me up when some of those same people call her character ""Littlefinger in a corset"". Seriously? Where? Not once has she ever done anything selfish for herself or betrayed and manipulated anyone for her own gain. Pretty much everything she ever did in season eight was trying to keep her family safe and wanting Jon to remain King in the North. That's the reason why she told Tyrion the truth about him, because she knew how dangerous Daenerys was and wanted to protect Jon from harm. And what does Dany do? Set fire to people when no one forced her to and then try to blame Sansa out of nowhere. 

But the actress herself, Sophie Turner getting hatred for literally no reason is just despicable. She's a pretty damn awesome person; intelligent, kind, funny, a badass feminist who works with organizations to help end violence and sexual assault against women and children, especially women and children of color. And yet, idiot antis just want to treat her like garbage. Literally the ONLY ""bad"" thing she did to really make them hate her was that she talked some smack about the character of Daenerys, which is freaking hilarious, considering that Dany completely deserves to be ridiculed. She has shown herself to be a power-hungry tyrant since pretty much the end of season one. She enjoys burning people alive for simply not agreeing with her, and of course she went off and burned King's Landing, killing millions of people. Which was COMPLETELY in character for her. She has flat out talked about wanting to burn cities since as far back as season two. You just haven't been paying attention. So yes, Sophie is right to talk about how she is a horrible person because she is!

So, they vilify her simply for talking about a FICTIONAL character, even though NOT ONCE has she ever said anything bad about the actors or actresses of the show. And in fact, it is well known that she is very close friends with damn near the entire cast of the show. Especially with Maisie, Kit, AND even Emilia. And if you're mad at her for having fun ""making fun"" of her friends, then you're really more idiotic than I thought. It's called playful back and forth banter which MANY people in this world have with their friends. There is absolutely NOTHING mean spirited about it at all. So screw all those people who made her life a living hell most of her career for no damn reason. No wonder she has quit Twitter for the time being. She suffered for years with depression and suicidal thoughts because of those pigs. This fandom truly can be toxic as hell."|Elisa800|False|https://redd.it/eictnv|0|0.41|0|7|1|gameofthrones

egjt06|2019-12-28 00:59:01|[SPOILERS] S8's accidental genius|"Before I start actually explaining the title, I'd like to say that, although the final season was noticeable worse than prime Game of Thrones, I still loved it in the way that I like both fancy Angus Beef burgers and homemade frozen burgers. S1-S7 (imo even 7 was really good) were amazing and S8, while definitely worse, is still enjoyable and fun for me.

Now onto my actual post: I've been thinking about S8 a lot recently and I'm just noticing some things that happened and were shown as one thing that was terribly executed (King Bran) but if it were shown in a more ""nobody is all good or all evil"" way, it would have been amazing. Some of these may be retcons but if it makes the show more likeable/watchable/bearable, it's worth it to me.

1) King Bran. Bran doesn't have the best story, not by far. In episode 4 he says he doesn't want anything at all, but in ep. 6 he asks ""why do you think I came all this way"" when asked if he would be king. All of the Lords seem to want that, without any apparent reason. One explanation is that they didn't. Tyrion didn't think Bran had the best story. Bran played them all, with or without his psychic powers. Most of that council was loyal to the Starks at one point, and Bran had been playing Tyrion for 3 episodes with his ""story"", all the while embedding the idea that he was fair and wise into Tyrion's mind. Bran wasn't the good guy, he was as much a villain as Cersei who, in the end, did nothing evil except for not sending an army, that was basically destroyed before eastern mercenaries reinforced, to fight a seemingly hopeless war. And executing a prisoner, that was pretty bad.

2) Master manipulator Sansa. She learned from the best. While she was painted as this brave and incredibly intelligent young woman who wants the best for her people and was the only one to see Dany for the monster she really was, her actual story involved more Littlefinger style politics than heroics. Dany felt alone because of Sansa. Sansa sent girls to all the survivors of the Battle of Winterfell which slowly led to all the people Dany knew leaving the party, making her feel isolated. Sansa used reverse psychology to get Dany rushing her army south so she was weak. She turned Varys against Dany in one episode. She even turned Arya, who was seen to admire Dany and her dragons in S8 and who was inspired by the Targaryen warrior queens, against Dany. And after she took an army that had been through hell twice to lay siege on her allies to free her brother, she sacrificed him so she could be queen of the North. This was political scheming that surpassed even Littlefinger, but D&D painted all of the Starks as heroes that were 100% definitely good.

3) Arya killing the Night King/ Jon yellingat a dragon. I don't really have a problem with this on like many people do. The way I imagine this scenario is this: Arya sneaks through Winterfell, trying to get to Bran. The final gate is blocked, however, by undead Viserion fighting Jon. Jon too was trying to get to Bran. He spots Arya, or maybe Bran was actually useful and told Jon through magic. Jon decides to sacrifice himself, so Viserion is distracted and Arya can go save Bran. He gets out of cover and screams for Arya to go (if you listen closely to the clip you can interpret a ""GO! GO GO GOOO!"" in his scream). Arya runs over, visible sneaks past the White Walkers and attacks the Night King. This way 2 dumb scenarios are turned into one sad one.


These things combined, with a bit of different storytelling and some season 4 dialogue, would change the ending from ""good Stark family saves Westeros and rules, happily ever after except Jon"" to ""after all these wars, another family comes out on top, with some better people (Jon) being manipulated and cast aside by political masterminds and, in the end, the world is probably a worse place than at the start"". I like the latter ending a lot better, and I probably didn't explain it well and left a bunch of holes in my scenarios but that's because I'm really tired and not a professional writer. I hope this has made some of you appreciate the show a bit more, or got you thinking about things that will make you appreciate it more.



By the way: These are not excuses for the bad writing of D&D, I lost faith in them as writers after them not showing up anywhere and the ""Game of Thrones was just an expensive school for us"" comment, and as people after it came out they pressured Emilia Clarke to do nude scenes. 
All in all however, the show isn't only the writers and I love it despite of D&D"|Hkrlje|False|https://redd.it/egjt06|2|0.5|0|10|1|gameofthrones

ef3729|2019-12-24 16:04:01|[SPOILERS] Does anyone else get sick of people acting like the show wasn't good after season 4?|"I see these posts all the time.... I cannot stand the people who post them. Game of thrones still had insane episodes in season 5 and 6. I hate when people say it got bad after season 4. Up until we reached the last couple episodes of season 7 there were no signs the show would end horribly like it did based on how the seasons were going. Obviously anyone can say looking back there were signs, but the truth was we all loved this show so much beyond season 4. Season 5 had great episodes in it. It had ""Hardhome"" which was one of the best episodes of the show and one of the highest rated episodes of any show ever with a 9.8 rating. This continued on for season 6 which had ""Battle of the Bastards"" and ""Winds of Winter"" rated 9.9 which is literally nearly perfect. To this day I can't think of any other show with multiple episodes above a 9.8. This is just a few episodes I'm naming because there were multiple great episodes in 5,6 and even 7. The only other show that has episodes rating that high that I can think of is ""Mr. Robot"" which truly does deserve all the praise and it ended great too, but i'm not here to talk about that show.

I'm just tired of reading on reddit that people act like they didn't love the show multiple seasons before. This show was one of the greatest shows of all time, but I will not act like a final season that was all time bad ruins all the enjoyment I had in the past with the great discussions we all had. The final season makes me not want to rewatch, I will admit that. But I refuse to admit I didn't love the show before it and I'm so tired of people acting like this show wasn't one of the best ever. No other show had the fandom that we had. These same people who say ""oh it wasn't good after season 4"" are the same people who came here week to week and had to watch the show live because it was that good and that important. There is no other show where I have to watch it the exact second it comes on like I had to with this show. While the last season truly broke my heart and ruined things it did not ruin the prior seasons. It's hard to get over how bad the final season was, but it does not ruin the enjoyment I had for the seasons prior. The first time I noticed things were getting kinda sketchy and the ending might not be great was when they went past the wall the bring back a walker. That entire thing was sketchy and not good, but before that things were never truly bad.

We all loved this show leading up till the end and there was a small vocal minority who stopped enjoying it once it wasn't perfectly following the books and somehow those people are the ones who are agreed with now and people ignore what a great show it once was. I just had to get this off my chest after seeing another person say this and seeing it so many times after the last few months. I could go on and on about how great things were before the end and it's a shame people who loved the show act like they didn't feel the same way. We are all upset at the finish, but we also mostly all enjoyed the time spent on the way there."|_A_Day_In_The_Life_|False|https://redd.it/ef3729|103|0.78|0|86|1|gameofthrones

Olenna clearly has the power to do so and so does Mace Tyrell I haven't rewatched that season in a while so I don't have the full scope of everything but I've watched clips on YouTube and they say that the Sept would kill Margaery and Loras if they did attack but that doesn't really make sense. Wouldn't they want proper justice for their wrong doings? I don't think death would be a valid atonement and I'm pretty sure that would go against what The Seven see as justice but I don't know the religion and its beliefs. I'd understand if they didn't attack the Sept out of fear of Tommen and what he'd do but I'm also positive that Tommen wouldn't want to solve violence with more violence.

ee8e5t|2019-12-22 18:35:41|[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones (Skyrim) mod looking for help!|"Greetings all!

I, alongside others from the community, are in the early stages of working on a large-scale Game of Thrones themed mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition and are searching for landscapers and interior designers, coders/scripters, pretty much anyone familiar with the Creation Kit, 3D/2D artists and writers/lore-masters to help out with the story. The mod will take place in a geographically accurate Skyrim-sized map of Westeros and feature all the most prominent characters and locations from the series.

Currently nothing's set in stone but we intend to create a branching quest-line based on the events of the books/show and provide choices at pivotal moments in the story, so the player can steer things in their own direction and influence Westeros to their liking. For example, saving >!Eddard!< from being executed and seeing how that affects the plot/world. Or taking sides against the Starks and fighting for the Lannisters. Or saving your favorite character from their grizzly end. Or sending your least favorite character to theirs. And, of course, this would mean alternate endings too.

1. If Tyrion doesn’t kill Tywin on the potty before leaving for Essos, I think Dany and more specifically Tyrion plotting against his father could be an interesting storyline, and I’m not sure how it would play out.

OR

2. If Robb Stark doesn’t meet Talisa Stark but meets Margaery Tyrell later on. I think if the Starks (Tully’s and eventually Arryns) with the Tyrell, it would be almost impossible to beat that combination. And I think it would have ended the WotFK storyline with a Stark on the throne, although not necessarily Robb, I think the most likely outcome here would have been Robb ascends to the Iron Throne, and either Bran as Lord of Winterfell after he returns (although unlikely) or Jon escapes the Night’s Watch and is pardoned by King Robb and is legitimatised and made Lord of Winterfell."|AdogHatler|False|https://redd.it/eedean|3|0.75|0|11|1|gameofthrones

My reaction after a couple of days that bummed me out:

The whole show was about the Stark family finding each other and surviving the worst possible scenarios thrown their way. So seeing them all go their separate ways - one of the few scenes that made me legit cry. I know a lot of fans are upset about Dany's ending.

But enlighten me here, what didn't you love about season 8? Why does it get so much hate?

Edit: I watched the cast's reactions to the ending during their table read. Kit's reaction says a lot.

edaccz|2019-12-20 13:41:38|[Spoilers] Season 6, 7 & 8, Hope to the Bitter END|"The last few seasons take quite a bit of deserved and undeserved heat, so I was thinking today maybe we could discuss some things we enjoyed and how long we held out hope from some of the most controversial, divisive television of all time...

S06 • I absolutely loved The Battle of the Bastards!  One of the most cinematic hours of television that rivals most Action/Adventure movies.  Once that wave of foes crashes into Jon Snow, I can't think of a more breathtaking, frenetic battle to rival what unfolds on our screens.  Also,for my money, it didn't feel like an obligatory huge battle episode just for the sake of having one to fill an episode number.   The stakes felt high, it mattered and boy did it deliver...  Then there is that opposite end of the same curve of Dany's Mhysa episode when Jin emerged from the crushing weight of a claustrophobic combatant mass.  The show was drawing parallels with those two characters and building their intertwined fates to a fever pitch so by the end of the saga they would go down as epic figures in this legendary historic tale in the making.  Stories would be told and retold for ages, songs would be written and sang throughout time by campfires, in keeps and echo through hallowed halls for eternity.   It was Epic Fantasy in the making...

S07 • The Spoils of War was showing us a darker turn and change in Dany still, rather than telling us it occurred.  The conflict of philosophy between Tyrion, Varys and Dany still seemed tangible and real.  The two most intelligent players in the great game were at least having dialogue about small machinations and chess like moves to guide this young, powerful future Queen hadn't completely disappeared and digressed into a game of checkers between inept players.  I still felt real possibility of resolving the conflicted nature inside that fiery Targaryen heart and head.  It would require finesse and a measured approach but we knew the advisors around her were more than capable of pulling this off.  Tyrion had moved mountains with less already.  

S08 • Jaime breaking free and travelling to Winterfell provided a glimmer of hope that a true united front was still possible in the great upcoming war with the White Walkers and their Legion.  The incidental ruling of the lands could be put aside to settle another day and another way.  His arch was on pace with the long game that had unfolded for 7 slow burn years.  If anyone could reach Cersei, it was Jaime with some clever assists from his brother Tyrion.  The duo was becoming a living embodiment of the Lannister strength and wisdom that was Tywin..   He had never been a one note ""bad guy"".  Was he part of a system whose time had come and gone, most certainly.  But his line possessed everything necessary to carry Westeros into the future it would need to continue and move forward. 

All this still seemed possible.  But like a steam locomotive that had built momentum across years and then suffered a sudden jarring halt, something detailed.  The reality of how things eventuated was inevitable but for longer than I thought in the moment, I still carried hope into the end and did see possibility and cohesion across the landscape of the entire series.  It just didn't unfold in such a way.

I am just curious if anybody else was still taking in the forest before the trees somehow got in the way?"|JAHtheBASTARD|False|https://redd.it/edaccz|8|0.76|0|3|1|gameofthrones

ed809o|2019-12-20 09:37:54|[Spoilers] What Is Dead May Never Die (part 2)|"**... And the Benevolent Master of Whisperers**
-

Now we know what Vala told the Spider: Euron was the Harpy.
___
But if Varys was aware of the Greyjoy's double identity, why lie about it to Tyrion? And why assist Euron, in any way, shape or form?
___
To see through the Spider's web of lies, we have to recall a s04e06 conversation between Varys and Prince Oberyn, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cudxwhDO0gQ&t=120s (2:00 - 2:15):

- Varys: *""[...] the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.”*

- Oberyn: *""Such as?""*

- Varys nods towards the Iron Throne; hinting he wants to sit someone else on that chair.

___
At first glance, it looked like this sentence referred to Daenerys. 
___
But if Varys was trying to lay the groundwork for a future alliance between Dorne and House Targaryen (as we would see in season 6 with Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes), show Oberyn would not have been the right person to talk to. That is, a Dornish Prince whose late sister, Elia Martell, had been raped and murdered because of her husband, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen (as in Daenerys Targaryen's brother), abandoning her and her children to run off with some Northern Lady (i.e. Lyanna Stark).
___
Still, there was a second interpretation to this scene. One involving a book candidate Oberyn would have supported with all his heart. A man that had yet to make his entrance in the game of thrones: the Red Viper's own nephew, Prince Aegon Targaryen (see https://redd.it/bonbil, chapter *""The Spider's Legacy""*).
___
In the show, Aegon will be a character Varys claims to be the son of Rhaegar & Elia, that he had smuggled from the Mountain's hands and raised as his own in Essos; all so he would become a good ruler for the realm. This unexpected player likely is a relative to Mopatis and to Varys. Hence the name FAegon (= Fake Aegon). 

*In the books, the son of Rhaegar & Elia will be a different character, someone much more familiar to the show audience: see “Aegon Targaryen, A Many Faced Prince –“, https://redd.it/89plsa (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZTSriPZCQo).*
___
From season 1 to season 8, everything Varys and Mopatis had done was meant to propel Aegon to the Throne: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7sx-ZayB_g&t=1095s (18:15 - 18:30). Which is why Lord Varys's claim to be working solely for the good of the realm and for the small people never made any sense. It was always about Aegon.
___
Hence Varys and Illyrio supporting Viserys, then Daenerys (neither of which were any good at politics). In order to help Aegon march on King's Landing, the Spider needed Dany and her dragons, as well as some army following her, to come to Westeros and weaken the peace of the realm. 
___
But when Daenerys decided to settle in Meereen until she had abolished slavery for good, Varys knew he had to act. Realistically, getting rid of slavery is not something one achieves in a lifetime, even with all the power and all the good will in the world. And Varys didn't have a lifetime to spare. He needed Dany and her dragons rampaging through Westeros as soon as possible.
___
In s06e03, when the Spider learned that the dreadful Euron was the head of the Harpies, he knew he had found the perfect villain to support for Dany to get back to Westeros. So instead of telling Tyrion the truth, Varys baited him into thinking the Masters were behind the Sons of the Harpy, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--hRp3IRxyA&t=348s (5:48 - 6:15), thus creating more chaos. Once again, Tyrion's trust in his ""friends"" led to his downfall.
___
Euron was the perfect ally for Varys: a disposable man, hated by the realm, that was working his hardest to bring Danerys back to Westeros; as well as a man with enough ships to carry her armies across the Narrow Sea.
___
Unfortunately for the Spider, Euron had already left Essos in s06e01 and had reached the Iron Islands by s06e02. Which meant Varys couldn't immediately get in touch with the pirate in s06e03. And in s06e05, any plans Varys might have had at forging an alliance between Daenerys & Euron collapsed when Yara stole her uncle's ships and headed to Meereen.
___
Luckily for the Master of Whisperers, the Greyjoy siblings didn't travel very furtively: see Volantis, s06e07, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hK1jc_NQZI; which gave Varys's little birds plenty of opportunities to spot the Ironborn on their way to Slaver's Bay. And thanks to his vast network of spies, Varys also was aware of Daenerys coming back to Meereen, with an army of Dothraki: s06e06, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRR0NlesJy8&t=19s (0:19 - 0:26), 
___
Left untouched, Dany and her allies would have barreled through the 7 Kingdoms in little to no time. Which is when the Spider realized it was time to shift the balance of power and set up better pieces for Aegon's entrance. Hence his leaving Essos in s06e08: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCcxyTLi9F0&t=69s (1:09 - 1:29).
___
___
The first person Varys met with was King Euron Greyjoy, a valuable pone to wreak havoc on Dany's frightening navy, and an essential ally to help Aegon's Golden Company cross the Narrow Sea.
___
As per usual, Varys introduced himself with his touching story:

*""I only live to serve the realm and the small folk. I have been to Meereen and I have seen what the Mother of Dragons' reign has done to the region. The Mad Targaryen Queen will only hurt the people, just like her father did. Which is why we need the 7 Kingdoms to become the 7 Kingdoms again. Too often in the past, the Great Lords of Westeros and the Ironborn have fought each other. It is time to reconcile our people once and for all. It is time for an Ironborn to become King of the 7 Kingdoms!""*
___
These words were music to Euron's hears. Being the cheeky pirate that he was, he accepted Varys's proposal. After all, he had always wanted to become King of the 7 Kingdoms.
___
Then, the Spider headed to Dorne, where he had no trouble convincing Ellaria Sand to join Daenerys's cause. At which point they invited Olena to their side: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR9RrqWERow. Strictly a matter of formality, given that Cersei had burned every Tyrell Olena had ever cared for earlier that episode (s06e10).
___
Of course, Varys's real objective here was to put the Dornish leaders as well as the the richest and second most powerful House in the 7 Kingdoms into the losing side.
___
Once he would have gotten rid of both of them (season 7), Aegon would have been free to:

- Claim his rightful place as the new Prince of Dorne (introducing himself as the son of Rhaegar & Ellia, which people wouldn't have had trouble believing since he is a Blackfyre and already looks like a Targaryen: https://forum.gameofthronestr.com/uploads/default/original/1X/9260636e14a1dc022c3ca3766420498dfa2fbed9.jpg); & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEgWN5Qxics&t=72s (1:12 - 1:20);

- Aim for the Iron Throne without having to worry about the Tyrells ever betraying him: like they had poisoned Joffrey; or like they had rebelled against the rightful King of the 7 Kingdoms, Stannis Baratheon.

___
However, on his way back to Essos, Varys secretly stopped by King's Landing, to meet with Queen Cersei Lannister. He sold Cersei the updated version of the same story he had told Euron:

*""The traitorous Dornish and the greedy Tyrells have switched sides and are now supporting the Mad Dragon Queen. We need to protect the realm! As a humble servant and defender of the small people, I can not stand by a second time while another Mad Targaryen ascends to power and burns our children and our cities to the ground. As Master of Whisperers, I will do everything in my power to support the Crown with every information I get my hands on.""*

*""But it won't be enough. Daenerys Targaryen is bringing hordes of savages to the 7 Kingdoms. The realm will need powerful allies to defeat those ennemies. Which is why we need soldiers used to dealing with these sorts of foreigners. In my time in Essos, I've learned that the Golden Company is the most effective and the most trustworthy sellsword company there is (plus they have elephants).""*

*""The Dragon Queen also has an imposing navy. Which is why we need the Iron fleet on our side. My little birds tell me Euron Greyjoy is already positively inclined to a marital union with House Lannister. Let us invite him to King's Landing and persuade the fool into an alliance. At least until the Iron fleet has defeated the Crown's ennemies.""*

___
Then, time jump to Essos where Dany, Varys and her Dothraki have started sailing towards Dragonstone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X6KOCAmX1U; after having done their fair share of pillaging of course, in order to afford the 1000+ ships the Mother of Dragons needed to cross the Narrow Sea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilH1WCGUIUE&t=25s (0:25 - 0:42).
___
___
In seasons 7 & 8, the Master of Whisperers kept his promise to the Crown. He fed Euron and Cersei intel on Dany's plans and whereabouts. Thus making Jaime and Euron appear like all-seeing tactical geniuses on the battlefield.
___
By s08e04, Varys had successfully trimmed Daenerys's armies down to a more manageable size, having gotten rid of: the Tyrells, Ellaria Sand, Dany's fleet, Rhaegal; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WfMBItXNTE&t=36s (0:36 - 0:45): *""The balance [of power] has grown distressingly even.""* - Varys.
___
And by the end of s08e05, all preparations had been made:

- Varys had successfully removed his name from the upcoming massacre of King's Landing by faking his own death: see https://redd.it/bonbil, *""The Mummer's Greatest Trick;""* even baiting the Lord of Light in the process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke4fSycEtTQ&t=68s (1:08 - 1:30).

- And he had gotten rid of every major player in the game of thrones: Cersei, Jaime, Euron, Dany (after the massacre she had inflicted on King's Landing, she would be at risk of being murdered on a daily basis), Tyrion (for supporting the Mad Queen).

___
All that was left now was to get rid of the other Aegon Targaryen (see chapter *""And Now It Begins,""* redd.it/bonbil): the war hero, Jon Snow (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=899bCsWQctY&t=35s [0:35 - 1:17]).
___
___
___
**The Drowned God**
-

Another side character that never made it into the small screen was Bloodraven, i.e. book Three-Eyed Raven (see https://redd.it/89pw94, chapter *""Aerys II, A Targaryen Mess -""*). While Brynden Rivers didn't appear in the TV series, this didn't mean he never had a part to play in this story. And if we looked carefully, there were signs of his involvement scattered throughout:
___
Despite looking like a candid pirate, Euron made sure to put Bloodraven's Red Eye on every military equipment he owned:

- On his banner/armor: s07e02, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-QhWJzdsR4&t=175s (2:55 - 2:58);

- On his ships: s08e04, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgH9vPRcv-E&t=190s (3:10 - 3:20);

- On his scorpions: s08e04/e05, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfnRseFJFIs&feature=youtu.be&t=52s (0:52 - 0:54) & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgH9vPRcv-E&t=268s (4:28 - 4:32).


All of this hinted that Bloodraven was still influencing the Greyjoy; regardless of the Three-Eyed Raven having been killed by the Night King (s06e05, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR8mJ1NnTP8&t=348s [5:48 - 6:10]).
____
In s08e06, the Book of Brothers added another clue to Brynden's existence, by mentioning Ser Duncan the Tall escorting Maester Aemon and the King's Uncle to the Wall: https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Book_of_Brothers. And who was King Maekar's uncle at the time? Brynden ""Bloodraven"" Rivers. This small hint suggested that Bloodraven had, at the very least, been alive at some point in the TV series.   
___
Besides, Quaithe of the Shadow's introduction also happened in the show, and her character wouldn't have made sense without Bloodraven: see *""A Shadow amidst Earth and Fire -,""*https://redd.it/89pzdp. And neither would Varys hearing a voice in the flames, one that would still haunt him decades later: s03e04, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTgiPmG7OLE&t=89s (1:29 - 2:10).
___
The next thing to look at is Euron. Even though the Greyjoy put a lot of effort into persuading the audience he was merely a regular pirate, pay attention to what happens when he engages in meaningful fights:

- On the verge of killing Balon, after having somehow infiltrated Pyke without being spotted: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4tNZO-96YY (0:01 - 0:23);

- When fighting Yara: at first, the sea is calm (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-QhWJzdsR4&t=175s [0:01 - 0:13]); then Euron enters the stage (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-QhWJzdsR4&t=157s [2:37 - 2:45]);


Euron doesn't wait for the storm, he brings the storm with him!
___
So where did he learn such spells? And who would have taught him?
___
Notice how Euron changes his character at will throughout the series: 

- On the Pyke bridge, he introduces himself as a dark and more serious individual: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4tNZO-96YY (0:01 - 2:35);

- During the Kingsmoot, he presents a typical Ironborn facade: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fQqbgycLRg&t=138s (2:18 - 5:20);

- And in King's Landing, he plays the role of a goofy gullible pirate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jZymJz-PM4&t=86s (1:26 - 5:13).  


It's almost as if Euron never stopped playing...
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vy3bp-EWMs&t=47s (0:47 - 0:54): ""We never stop playing."" - Jaqen H'ghar
___
If Euron's ability to swap from persona to persona sounds distressingly familiar to the Faceless Men, it is because both had been trained by the same mentor: the Children of the Forest. In old Valyria, the Children had taught the Faceless Men how to use the magic of the faces (see *""Valar Morghulis -,""* https://redd.it/89pzdp). Nowadays, through another Three-Eyed Raven pawn (Bloodraven), they had instilled the same knowledge into Euron (using dreams and other visions Bloodraven would have forwarded to the pirate).
___
This is one of the rare times where the show might prove more confusing than the books. In the books, the TER is Bloodraven. But in the show, he is a 1,000 years old individual. Both of these characters exist separately: both tied to two different weirwood trees, in different caves north of the Wall; both slaves to the Children’s will. Which meant that while the 1,000 years old TER was killed by the Night King, show Euron was still being guided by another greenseer: Bloodraven.
___
Now why would Euron think Bloodraven was a deity? Or even the messenger of a god? Quaith had interfered plenty of times with Daenerys's dreams and the Targaryen girl hadn't paid much attention to them (chapter: *""A Shadow amidst Earth and Fire -,""* https://redd.it/89pzdp). The same went for the Night King, warging multiple times into young Bran, Melisandre, and even into Rickon's dreams, without much success (see *""The Three-Eyed Crow,""* https://redd.it/8i9lzc). So how did Bloodraven manage to persuade Euron? 
___
___
It is said that Euron once lost his senses during a storm while sailing on the Jade Sea, leaving his crew no choice but to tie him to the mast to prevent him from jumping overboard. The day after, once the storm had passed and he was let down, he had all their tongues ripped out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4tNZO-96YY&t=97s (1:37 - 1:58).  
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4tNZO-96YY&t=117s (1:57 - 2:04): *""What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm?""* - Balon Greyjoy
___
Balon was right. Why would Euron lose his senses during a simple storm? The Greyjoy had presumably been through countless storms before, and he wasn't a particularly fearful man either. No matter how strong the weather might have been, how come he lost his senses before any of his crew did?
___
And why would any Ironborn follow him after the incident? Surely, they would have elected a new captain, one that wouldn't panic at sea; ala Theon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deg7HHcY_Ws&t=7s (0:07 - 4:00). Worse, why allow a coward to cut off their tongues?  
___
None of this made any sense.
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4tNZO-96YY&t=50s (0:50-0:59):

- Balon Greyjoy: *""I thought you'd be rotting under some foreign see by now.""* 

- Euron: *""What is dead may never die.""*

___
The truth is Euron died during that night: a powerful wave threw the Son of the Sea Wind overboard and his body drowned in the Jade Sea.
___
This is when Bloodraven, under the control of the Children, revived Euron for the first time. Thanks to the weirwood trees Silence was made of, https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/30h7dj/spoilers_all_the_composition_of_eurons_boat/, Bloodraven was able to witness the scene and apply his magic. Thus bringing the confused Greyjoy back to life.
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOAZYjTJ1Ms&t=89s (1:29 - 1:37): *""What is dead may never die. But rises again, harder and stronger ""*
___
This is why Euron lost his mind and why he was trying to throw himself back into the ocean. In his head, he was supposed to be dead. But Bloodraven revived him again. Until his crew tied him to the mast to prevent him from jumping overboard. The resurrection fueled Euron's lungs with power from the weirwood net, making him much more resistant to drowning. Which means it is very possible Euron was faking his agony during that crowning ceremony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efwghvZcMRc&t=348s (5:48 - 7:40). Hence the humorous timing of the scene: Greyjoy was playing dead. On the other hand, the drowning did affect his brain a little bit (turning him into more of a psycho). 
___
After the storm, both Euron and his crew came to the conclusion that he must have been a god. No mere mortal could survive (multiple) drowning and still stand up. The Ironborn also came to the conclusion that he had to have been the Drowned God. This is why his crew allowed him to cut off their tongues (as an offering of sorts to their newfound living god). And this is why they still followed him after those events, instead of electing a new captain; one that wouldn't lose his senses during a simple storm.
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4tNZO-96YY&t=69s (1:09 - 1:16), Euron: *""I don't mock the Drowned God. I am the Drowned God.""*
___
Soon after, the visions and the dreams started. Bloodraven used Silence's weirwoods to forward Euron scenes from past & future events; telling him what to do and where to go in order to be freed from his human prison of flesh and to be reborn into the Drowned God. 
___
___
___
**A Champion for the Old Gods**
-

By training the dreadful Ironborn and granting him a second life, the Children had forged a new champion for the Old Gods: Euron Greyjoy. He was the key to helping Daenerys survive Essos, while teaching her how to train her dragons. Of course, the goal here was to foster Dany's dragons, until they had reached Westeros and at least one of them had made it past the Wall, right into the arms of the Night King. Then, the White Walkers would have broken free from their prison of ice (s07e07), wrecking havoc on mankind on their way south.
___
Once the living had lost the battle versus the dead, surely, men would try to retreat through the seas, to escape from the Night King's wrath. This is where Greyjoy comes into play (see https://redd.it/89pzdp, *""Justice for the Children -""*). By baiting Euron into casting the *Hammer of the Waters* (https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hammer_of_the_waters), i.e. the greatest storm the world has ever seen, the Children would prevent any living soul from fleeing via water. Thus leaving mankind no choice but to face the White Walkers on the field. Until every single man had been erased from Westeros, like it had once been in the Dawn Age.
___
Hence the Children manipulating Euron through Bloodraven.
___
___
In his journey to be reborn as a God, Euron was first guided to Daario Naharis, a particularly skillful warrior consumed by sorrow.
___
Euron introduced himself as the Drowned God, letting the gladiator know he had heard his distress and had seen his prayers, which is why he had come to his help (through Bloodraven's weirwood visions). Daario was surprised, but he suspected Greyjoy to be a charlatan of sorts. After all, he had been looking for the Drowned God for quite some time, and rumors traveled fast. This 'Euron' might have heard his story somewhere in Essos, and he would have planned on taking advantage of a man's broken heart. It was to be expected from a pirate. 
___
This is when Euron dove into water and immersed himself for half an hour, casting spells under water without blinking an eye. Daario was astonished. No sorcerer in Essos had this kind of power. If this man wasn't a god, he certainly was no mere mortal. Realizing this was his best chance at talking to the Drowned God or at least, at getting closer to him, Daario agreed to Euron's pact. Naharis would give his sword and in exchange, the Drowned God would bring Daario's beloved back to the living, as soon as his powers were restored.
___
It turns out Daario wasn't such a fool for putting his faith in the Son of the Sea Wind after all.   
___
Once the agreement was settled, the first thing Euron did was send Naharis to the Second Sons. He told the gladiator to enroll as a sellsword and climb the ranks as fast as he could, until he had met Daenerys Targaryen. Then, he ordered Daario to pledge his sword as well as the Second Sons to the Mother of Dragons, and to protect her with his life if need be.
___
With this, we are back to part 10, chapter: *""The Gullible Sellsword, the Cheeky Pirate...;""* where Euron & Daario orchestrated the Sons of the Harpy arc to persuade Dany to move out of Meereen and to bring her dragons back to Westeros. 
___
Unfortunately, none of this panned out, as Daenerys flew away on Drogon's back. Which is when Euron realized it was time to sail to Pyke and claim the title of King of the Iron Islands.
___
___
As soon as he was crowned King, Euron put his people to work:

S06e05, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efwghvZcMRc&t=518s (8:38 - 8:59): *""Go back to your homes, chop down every tree you can find, quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks, I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships, and I will give you this world!""*
___
Grejoy didn't lie to his fellow Ironborn. These ships weren't meant for Daenerys, nor were they meant to conquer the seas. There were meant to carry as many sacrificial lambs (men) as possible, in order to cast the Hammer of the Waters: the Last Storm that would see Euron re-emerge as the Drowned God.
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4tNZO-96YY&t=126s (2:06 - 2:12): *""I am the storm - the first storm, and the last.""* 
___
Immigrant Song - Led Zeppelin (from D&D's playlist), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17CsLvJS4cc&t=24s (0:24 - 0:40):

- *""The hammer of the gods [= Hammer of the Waters] will drive our ships to new lands [...];""*

- *""Valhalla, I am coming!""* --> These ships are all sinking and everyone inside will be sent to the afterlife, i.e. be killed.

___
But even the blood of as many men as 1,000 ships could hold wasn't going to be enough to cast the Last Storm. Euron needed another source of magic to complete the ritual. One that would prove powerful enough to overcome both the Wall and the magical barrier protecting Winterfell: the fire of a dragon (see *""The Battle for the Dawn,""* https://redd.it/bkzyrj).
___
The intense heat dragon fire generates can cause air to rapidly rise in the smoke plume, thus forming fire fueled thunderstorm clouds: https://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/10562920/data/how-a-bushfire-creates-a-storm-data.jpg. Therefore inducing a storm of its own. 
___
This is the support Euron would require to cast the Last Storm. Hence his helping Daenerys (since he never knew he was working for the Children of the Forest). However, if the clouds were going to be big enough to summon the cataclysm, Euron would need Drogon to exert himself to the utmost, much more than he had in s08e05.     
___
Luckily for the Ironborn, his visions had shown him just the right partner in crime. A man that ""[...] would see this country burn if [his protege] could be King of the Ashes:"" Varys the Spider, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFZen-XO5II&t=170s (2:50 - 3:47). Note that show Varys is a darker character than his book counterpart.
___
Euron had seen Drogon being pushed to the limits in the war to come. The one opposing Daenerys and her Dothraki to Aegon and his elephants (see *""And Now It Begins,""* https://redd.it/bonbil). This final war would be the perfect opportunity for Euron to cast the Last Storm. All he would have to do was sail close to King's Landing around that time, and wait with his 1,000 ships.
___
This is why Euron played along when he first met Varys in s06e09/e10 (see chapter *""... and the Benevolent Master of Whisperers""*). By presenting himself as a title hungry Ironborn, Euron made sure the Spider would never suspect the gullible pirate. And this is why he willingly played a part in weakening Dany's armies: so the balance of power between Aegon and the Mother of Dragons would grow even. Thus forcing Drogon to breath as much fire as possible in the war to come. Therefore generating the dream thunderstorm for Greyjoy.

*This also explains why Euron didn't care about Cersei’s baby in s08e04: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ykYdR7kduc&t=277s (4:37 - 5:07). Cersei and the Iron Throne were mere pawns in his masterplan. In fact, Littlefinger style, Euron playing the role of your average crazy pirate was one of the better ways not to have a single soul lay eye on him, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIVOjnqDfA0&t=69s (1:09 - 1:21): ”If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.” - Petyr Baelish*
___
___
Unfortunately for our pirate, the price to pay for assisting Varys was chosing the wrong side, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rguS34xXLY8&t=64s (1:04 - 1:17):

- Yara: *""You picked the losing side.""* 

- Euron: *""Then I'll sail the Iron fleet somewhere else.""*

___
Euron could always sail the Iron fleet somewhere else, but after Daenerys had defeated Cersei in s08e05, it was going to be months before Aegon and his armies had marched on King's Landing. Which on a side note, is the perfect window for Dany to have her baby boy: https://redd.it/8i9lzc, *""A Martinesque Ending;""* as she was already pregnant back in s08e04 (https://i.redd.it/ljgx7z0r24931.jpg; https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/canpmj/spoilers_extended_game_revealed_shows_a_quite/?utm_medium=usertext&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=gameofthrones&utm_content=t1_eta8a3w). 
___
So how was Euron going to prevent Drogon from burning his precious ships for entire months? He couldn't possibly hide them from Daenerys as young Bran was still around. All the Mad Queen had to do was ask Bran and she'd know at any given moment where to find the Iron fleet.
___
Luckily, our Drowned God had kept an ace up his sleeve: Yara Greyjoy. By keeping his niece alive and in relatively good shape, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rguS34xXLY8&t=17s (0:17 - 0:23), the King of the Iron Islands had ensured that, were he and Cersei to be defeated in s08e05, the Iron fleet would still be safe under Yara's command (since she was Dany's ally).
___
To this end, the first thing Euron did was set Yara free (note that capturing her in season 7 was imperative to trimming down Dany's forces, so Varys would have a fighting chance against her armies). In s07e02, he had already prepared the way by allowing Theon to escape: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-QhWJzdsR4&t=401s (6:41 - 7:43); knowing the broken Greyjoy would come back to rescue his sister. Then, instead of detaining Yara in some cell below the deck, he kept her confined in a large cabin, barely guarded at all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rguS34xXLY8&t=98s (1:38 - 2:00). If you play this scene at 50% speed, you'll count at most 6 pirates defending Silence's deck. That is, 6 men to guard Euron's flagship, as well as his most valuable prisoner. This was no coincidence. Euron had paved the way for Theon's rescue mission. 
___
As per Yara, since she was never brought below the deck and because Euron's crew was full of mutes, she never suspected anything magical going on.
___
Later on, despite Silence being the faster ship and Euron's agenda being free from s08e01 to s08e04 (when he showed up at Dragonstone), the pirate never made any effort to chase Yara. Nor did he try to prevent her from taking the Salt Throne.
___
After having gifted Yara her freedom along with the Iron Islands, the next step for Euron was to save his precious ships, before Dany's wrath had fallen upon them in s08e05. To this end, Greyjoy did exactly what he had told Yara in s08e01: he sailed Silence and most of the Iron fleet somewhere else.
___
S08e05, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfnRseFJFIs&t=49s : right before Dany attacked, we could barely count 100 to 150 ships. Silence was gone. 850+ ships out of 1,000 were also gone. All of them had left King's Landing at Euron's command. 
___
Once our pirate died in s08e05, his navy had no choice but to follow Yara's lead. Thus ensuring his 1,000 vessels would be free to roam, without risking being roasted by Drogon.
___
___
Now what about Euron himself? Did the Drowned God let a cripple put an end to his divine journey? 
___
Never. Euron doesn't fear death, because death barely has any impact on him (since Bloodraven revives him at will). Look at his fight against the Sand Snakes in s07e02, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-QhWJzdsR4&t=270s (4:30 - 5:30): Euron is fearless, continuously putting his body forward, fighting without a second thought. A spear pierces through him at 4:43; a knife cuts him deep at 5:20; yet, he doesn't slow down. He even makes the Sand Snakes look like kindergarten opponents. And these assailants had gotten rid of Areo Hotah and had gone toe to toe with Bronn: s05e06, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISnnA-v0VWQ&t=258s (4:18 - 5:20).
___
Besides, the Dornish were very likely to have poisoned their weapons. So how did our pirate feel after such a gruesome fight? Did the poison affect him at all?
___
One episode later, s07e03, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMhxXv5zVto&t=47s (0:47 - 0:57), with Yara's scratch still on his face (hinting that little time had passed), Euron was riding like a new man. Feeling better than ever! 
___
Next, let's look at the sequence that led to his death in s08e05, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YGma1IqtNs&t=157s (2:37 - 7:31).
___
Since Bloodraven had brought Euron back to the living by fueling energy from the weirwood net directly into his lungs & into his body, he became much more resistant to drowning. This is similar to what happened to Jon Snow after being resurrected: when he fell into a frozen lake in s07e06, he found himself resistant to hypothermia (because his heart was powered by the weirwood net). 
___
This explains how Euron was able to swim from his sinking ship to the coast, in the middle of winter, while being fully clothed and armed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YGma1IqtNs&t=162s (2:42 - 2:47). This also explains why he had enough strength left to engage in a fight against Jaime. And this is why he didn't care about dying and was more interested in contemplating his achievement of that day: having killed Jaime Lannister. It made sense. Why bother thinking about death when you know you'll revive?
___
As per why Euron fought Jaime, it was because the Lannister was going to stand between him and killing Cersei. 
___
The Spider had been plotting the war that would put Aegon on the Throne for years. Were Cersei to spill the beans on her alliance with the Master of Whisperers, it might have endangered Varys's plans; risking shifting the balance of power in Dany's favor. Thus preventing Drogon from going berserk on Aegon's armies. Therefore failing to create the gargantuan thunderstorm Euron had been waiting for.
___
However, once those rocks fell over the Lannister twins (s08e05), Euron assumed Cersei was dead. Then, he took Davos's boat, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YGma1IqtNs&t=162s (2:42 - 2:45), and rejoined his ship.
___
Just like in this song from D&D's endgame playlist, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q40-TT6swoE&t=38s (0:38-0:44): *”You think I’m dead. But I sail away. On a wave of mutilation. Wave of mutilation.”*
___
Besides, look at the interview Pilou Asbaek (Euron) gave to Esquire, https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-thrones-actor-calls-george-rr-martin-change-fate-character-2560485:

- *“I’ve texted George RR Martin suggesting him to change that Golden Company shit for those golden rings,”*

- *“The books should end with [Cersei & I’s] wedding, saying yes over two marvelous elephants, ideally,”*

- Talking to Lena Headey: *“And what about tweeting that I was and will always be the love of your life? I miss you. Yours, Pilou. Please do it for your salty boy, blondie.”*

- Addressing Nikolaj Coster-Waldau: *“You need to clarify in public [that] I was the one who killed you, not the f***ing brick. Please, seriously, come on. Confirm it on Twitter, or in your next interview, I don’t give a shit.”*

- *“All the best, yours, Pilou. P.S. Please remember to tell people that I killed you, not the f***ing brick.”*

___
You have to give it to Pilou, the man is entertaining. But no one gives interviews like that without a backup plan. This wasn't the last we had seen of Euron Greyjoy.
___
___
Finally, the season 8 Histories and Lore bonus video about the Greyjoy Rebellion gave the more explicit clues, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9PMbCqR5fI&t=270s (4:30 - 5:30). In that clip, Pilou talked in a completely different voice from the one he had accustomed the audience to in seasons 7 & 8, a more serious tone:

- Euron: *""I made sure the Silence escaped. That was enough for me.""* --> Like he did before the massacre of King's Landing in s08e05. Silence and most of his 1,000 ships were nowhere to be found (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfnRseFJFIs&t=8s [0:08 - 1:43]);

- [...]

- Jaime: *""Why didn't you just abandon [Balon] after Fair Isle? Why risk your precious life fighting for him at Pyke?""*

- Euron: *""I wanted to kill the best knights in Westeros.""*

- Jaime: *""You failed.""*

- Euron: *""So did you. [...] And now, I'm back!""* --> Hinting at Jaime failing to kill Euron in s08e05, and at his upcoming return.

- Jaime corrects him: *""You were back.""*

- [...]

- Euron, completely ignoring the fact that Jaime just reminded him he had died in this story: *""I will never see those shit-stained rocks again. But I'm getting old. And I find my-self wanting to sit down, as my father and brother did in their time. They just chose the wrong chair.""* 

___
Euron will not return to the Iron Islands in the ending to come. But he will be heading to King's Landing.

I don't recall Robb even reassuring his mother. Yet in season six, when Sansa escapes Winterfell and asks Jon for help to get it back, he agrees. 
I just don't understand this. I would assume that out of all her siblings, Sansa would be closest to Robb by default, and I know she was never close to Jon. Robb has a larger army, he knows his sister is being held in captivity, yet he doesn't even plan anything. Jon, on the other hand, has a group of Wildlings he'll have to persuade to fight for him, and to top it all off, Sansa isn't even a prisoner at this point.

___
Kristian Nairn (Hodor), https://www.psychobunny.com/pages/kristian-nairn-men-of-mischief: *“I don’t think the criticism [season 8] received was deserved, [...]. My only qualm was that I felt that it could’ve been a little longer — I missed the Game of Thrones of old that paid such attention to small details — like a ten-minute dialogue scene. But, because the clock was ticking and they’re heading towards a conclusion [Note that he says 'are heading' and not 'were'], it lost a bit of subtlety and that was something people loved about the show, it was a show where even the small characters had a role to play.”*
___

In part 9 of this series of posts, https://redd.it/bqw2aq, we had introduced the possibility of more Game of Thrones to come. Now with parts 10, 11 & 12, we will follow the rest of Kristian's advice and bring to light some of the smaller characters.
___
It all starts with one of the most confusing and seemingly fruitless plot lines of seasons 5 & 6: the Sons of the Harpy.
___
___
*The following are show only theories. Special thanks & credit to EternalScratches for connecting key dots in: ""A Stormy Mess;"" ""A Champion for the Old Gods;"" ""Old Kingsroad;"" plus a bonus chapter.*
___
___
___
**The Mask of the Ghiscari**
-
In season 5 episode 1, we are first introduced to the Sons of the Harpy, a counter insurgency group put together by the noble houses of Meereen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69avSqBkqbk (0:01 – 1:06). Their target is the Unsullied.
___
After a bit of digging from the Second Sons, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYLg0d2dKeQ (0:01 – 1:55), Daario Naharis easily captures a Son of the Harpy.
___
In s05e02, he interrogates the young man and learns that he is poor, despite being born free. Which leads Mossador and Daenerys to jump into concluding that the Masters of Meereen are responsible for the recent murders: hiring poor, free men to act in their stead, hidden behind masks of the Harpy. Naturally, Hizdahr zo Loraq refutes this hypothesis and denies any involvement from the Masters.
___
Until this point, the plotline isn't very surprising. It made sense for the former Masters to rebel against the new leader in town. And it made sense for them to attempt to take Meereen back; by one way or another. Like Barristan Selmy said, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69avSqBkqbk&t=16s (0:11 – 0:16): *”It’s only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors always meet with resistance.”*
___
What is strange however, is how little information Daario had managed to extort from the Son of the Harpy. Especially given how openly he had bragged about his interrogation skills, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYLg0d2dKeQ&t=123s (2:03 – 2:17): 

- Daario: *”The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.”*

- Barristan: *“How do you know that?”*

- Daario: *”Because I questioned him.”*

- Barristan is silenced.

___
Strange how confident Naharis is for a man that hasn’t even figured out who had paid the Son of the Harpy. Even stranger that this mere sentence, *”Because I questioned him,”* was enough to begrudgingly convince the former Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
___
Selmy was a seasoned warrior and had presumably questioned and seen questioned countless suspects in his time serving under the Mad King. For him not to retort to Daario hinted that he had seen the sellsword in action and had witnessed how effective his methods could be. Which meant it wasn’t overconfidence speaking when Daario declared: *“The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.”*
___
On the other hand, the captive might have been a tough nut to crack. But here again, the idea doesn’t stand. Look closely at the prisoner’s body, before Mossador kills him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iScHpvPCGfc (0:02 – 0:28). The man is barely injured at all...
___
So how tough exactly was Daario with his interrogation process? And how much effort did he really put into finding out the truth for the Son of the Harpy to be in such a good shape? Even Theon had lasted longer and endured much harsher treatment before spilling the beans.
___
All of this meant that Daario Naharis, an accomplished interrogator: had easily captured a Son of the Harpy whose background incriminated the Masters; had put little to no effort into figuring out the truth from this prisoner; then had confidently claimed there couldn’t possibly be any more information left to extort from this man.
___
It’s as if the Tyroshi sellsword was trying to cover for the Son of the Harpy, while compromising the Masters of Meereen. But because Naharis would always display his carefree persona, no one ever dared suspect the fool (aside from Jorah, who knew a thing or two about treason: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=635s [10:35 - 11:22]; & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=1763s [29:23 - 29:53]).
___
What's even more surprising is that despite being the first man to put his hands on a Son of the Harpy, Daario didn't manage to capture a single Harpy in the next 2 seasons. Now how odd is that?
___
___
___
**The Simplest Man You'll Ever Meet**
-

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=371s (6:11 – 6:24): 

- Daario Naharis: *""The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die: the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked [and] the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.""*

- Mero: *""You will die young.""*

___
The Titan's Bastard couldn't have been more right. As they say in Alaska: *""There are old pilots, and there are bold pilots, but there are no old, bold pilots.”*
___
In the books, Daario has been killed by Euron from the beginning, in need of a face to get closer to the Mother of Dragons (https://redd.it/89plsa, chapter *”The fate of Daenerys Targaryen”*). But in the show, Naharis is still alive. And he isn't nearly as simple-minded as he would like to pretend.
___
Which explains why he is still breathing and why the crew decided to swap actors early on, https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-daario-naharis-recast-why-reason/. Ed Skrein was a perfect 'Euron-using-Daario's-face' Daario; but Michiel Huisman enacted a more conflicted personnage, hidden behind a happy-go-lucky facade. And in season 4, when it became clear to Martin that his books would not be finished in time, the writers had no choice but to take some of the show characters into a different direction, in order to close out the series (r.i.p. post-season 3 Jorah: see *""The Bear's Loyalty,""* https://redd.it/8do8by). Daario's character was one of them.
___
___
Initially, both book & TV show portrayed Daario as a typical mercenary, lusting for war and women, no strings attached:

- A Storm of Swords: *""I count no day as lived unless I have loved a woman, slain a foeman, and eaten a fine meal.""*

- S04e07, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr6EkLH3MQ0&t=53s (0:53 - 0:59): *""I only have two talents in this world: war and women [...];""*

___
But the more the show progressed, the more this facade crumbled.
___
When Dany is captured in s05e09, it is Daario Naharis who takes charge and appoints the right people to the right tasks in order to preserve the city of Meereen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=3755s (1:02:35 - 1:03:55). He outsmarts Tyrion, Jorah and Missandei; even seizing the last word: *""Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her.""* Surprising acumen coming from a man with a supposed two point skillset. 
___
In s06e10, soon after Daenerys commands Daario to stay in Meereen, Naharis realizes those are Tyrion's words. Which is when he openly dismisses her intellect, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=5074s (1:24:34 - 1:24:46):

- Daario: *""The Dwarf told you to do this.""* 

- Daenerys: *""No one tells me to do anything.""*

- Daario, looking the other way: *""Clever fellow, can't argue with his logic. I'm no use to you over there.""*

___
It seems Daario is much smarter than he lets on. Even stranger that this final breakup with the Mother of Dragons didn't seem to affect him much, if at all. For a man having supposedly killed his lieutenants over Dany's beauty, this is one coldhearted and well collected reaction. 
___
Then comes the most incriminating event:
___
S05e07, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=2990s (49:50 - 50:22), Daario Naharis: *""[...] I know I’m here to serve my queen and not give advice, but can I make one more suggestion? [...] On the day of the Great Games, gather all the Great Masters and Wise Masters and Worthy Masters you can find and slaughter them all.""*
___
And what happens on the day of the Great Games? Word per word what Daario had advised: s05e09, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utrGvDu_HKE&t=25s (0:25 – 0:40). Now either Naharis is a prophet, or the sellsword is tied to the Sons of the Harpy.
___
Finally, in s05e09, during the Fighting Pits massacre, Daario even commanded some Sons of the Harpy; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utrGvDu_HKE&t=60s (1:00 - 1:12; at 50% playback speed):

- (1:00 - 1:02) Hizdahr tries to flee with Daenerys;

- (1:02 - 1:03) Daario sees the scene and grimaces, displeased with the attempt;

- (1:03 - 1:05) Daario relaxes his body. And at 1:04, he makes a clear sign with his Arakh, signaling the SotH to execute Hizdahr;

- (1:05 - 1:08) Hizdahr is murdered;

- (1:08 - 1:09) The Son of the Harpy sees Dany and goes straight toward her. He disregards Daario's presence (since he knows Daario is an ally). But at 1:09, the SotH is surprised by Naharis turning on him;

- (1:09 - 1:11) The Son of the Harpy dies. Jorah kills the rest of Daario's accomplices.

___
In fairness to the sellsword, he did warn the audience:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=2918s (48:38 - 48:48): *""My motivations are entirely impure.""*

- & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg8cJ5wwMQY&t=41s (0:41 - 0:44) Daario: *""We will all disappoint [Daenerys] before long.""*

___
___
S03e08, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=516s (8:14 – 8:50): *""I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to.""* - Naharis.
___
It turns out the simplest man we'd ever meet wasn't that simple after all. He was a clever sellsword, conspiring with the Sons of the Harpy while hiding his real motive.
___
Which then begs the question: why? Why would Daario side with the Sons of the Harpy? What would he have to gain?
___
___
___
**Hot Blood**
-

S03e09, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=642s (10:42 - 10:48): *""I have no interest in slaves, a man cannot make love to property.""*
___
In season 3, Daario is presented as a fairly charming ladies man. And although he had some principles, you wouldn't exactly call him a romantic either. Even his relationship with Dany was based purely on physical attraction.
___
But in s06e04, after weeks of traveling with Jorah, he let this sentence slip: *""You're a romantic [Jorah]. I admire that. Sometimes I look at you and I think: 'that's what I'll be like when I grow old'.""* - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=3908s (1:05:08 - 1:05:15).
___
Now this is strange. According to Daario, he doesn't aspire to, one day, become a romantic; he thinks he already is one!
___
At this stage, one would think Daario was simply ignorant. But in the previous chapter, *The Simplest Man You'll Ever Meet,* we had established Naharis was too clever to be this oblivious. Which meant Daario was truly in love. The question then becomes: with whom?
___
After reviewing his arc, the closest thing to a bond you will ever find this man have is to his favorite plaything:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=1432s (23:52 - 24:07): Daario kisses the hilt of his dagger;

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=1943s (32:23 - 32:31): Daario plays with his dagger;

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=4149s (1:09:09 - 1:09:25): Daario refuses to leave his dagger behind - *""I am very attached to this knife;""*

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=4311s (1:11:51 - 1:12:07): *""Told you. Very attached to this knife.""* - Naharis

___
For all the love Daario bore his knife, the dagger itself wasn't that special. It is a Myrish stiletto, with a golden hilt shaped in the form of a woman, naked and wanton: http://www.valyriansteel.com/shop/images/uploads/VS7%20Knife%207.jpg.
___
Which meant either Daario was a particularly superstitious man and he was convinced only this knife would bring him luck. Or the Tyroshi sellsword wasn't telling us the whole truth. 
___
___
In s05e01, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=1977s (32:57 - 34:08), Daario explains that he was the son of a prostitute in Tyrosh, who later sold him into slavery when he was twelve years old, to a man from Tolos. There, he was trained for combat in the fighting pits, where he debuted at the age of sixteen. Soon, 10,000 men and women were screaming his name. By the time of his Master's death, Daario had earned his owner so much money that he was rewarded with freedom. At which point he joined the Second Sons.
___
Now, if we ever believe Daario was in love, the only time for that to have happened was during his days in the fighting pits. Simply because he was twelve years old before that; and after, he had joined the Second Sons where he displayed no interest in lasting relationships. Besides, the fondness with which Daario reminisces about his time as a gladiator suggests that he was truly happy during those years.
___
And if you've ever seen Spartacus, you know the only people not called slaves young Daario would have had the opportunity to spent time with were his Masters. Or in this case, his Master's daughter.
___
It isn't hard to imagine young Daario falling in love with his Master's daughter, the one rich and powerful girl he grew up with. In Daario's eyes, she would have been a Princess. The same goes for the Master's daughter: seeing Daario rise to fame in the Dragon Pits, day after day, week after week, until 10,000 men and women chanted his name as he remained undefeated; Daario must have looked like a young King.
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq0T976CPSw (0:01 - 0:45), Kaleo - Hot Blood (from D&D's end game playlist, https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/bb9r11/dds_got_spotify_playlist_of_songs_containing_the/):

- *You turn your back, you're a broken man;*

- *You come around and just dying to shake your hand;*

- *I don't expect you to understand;*

- *Just keep telling yourself there's no shame;*


- *They don't know 'bout who we are;*

- *They don't know 'bout you and I;*

- *They ain't know 'bout the stars of your eyes;*

- *Oh hot blood love is gonna get ya;*

___
Daario & his princess cherished their young love. The Tolosi merchant and his daughter would often travel hundreds of miles, from Tyrosh to Myr, then back to Tolos (https://www.numerama.com/content/uploads/2019/05/worldoficeandfire-copie.png). Sometimes, on her way back, the Master's daughter would buy gifts for Daario. And one day, as she returned from Myr, she offered young Daario a particularly beautiful dagger, with a golden hilt fashioned in her shape. She explained to Daario that as long as he held on to this knife, she would always be by his side, even in the fighting pits. 

___
On the other hand, traveling through the Summer Sea was dangerous business: https://www.numerama.com/content/uploads/2019/05/worldoficeandfire-copie.png. In order to reach Tolos, one had to go around Valyria and through the Gulf of Grief, sometimes navigating under heavy weather; on top of avoiding Pirates, Stone Men and whatnot.
___
Although Daario's Master was an experienced sailor, he couldn't avoid the occasional storm. And on one fateful night, the tide turned. A monstrous storm caught on to his ship and his crew faced waves so high and blasts so strong that most of his men were thrown overboard. Daario's Master got gravely injured. And although he managed to come back to Tolos, he ultimately passed away from his wounds. 
___
Except on that vessel was also sheltered Naharis's beloved. And on that day, the Master's daughter drowned as well. So did Daario's heart...

No matter how skilled, no matter how trained, the undefeated Daario Naharis, whose name was screamed by tens of thousands of men and women, feared by all in the fighting pits, was completely powerless in the face of destiny. The young man's heart crumbled into a thousand pieces (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yOZEiHLuVU).
___
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE Daario&t=545s (9:05 - 9:11): *""[...] I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice.""*
___
Where Maximus Decimus had resigned himself to his fate, young Daario refused to let go. No matter the odds. No matter the consequences. He set himself to bring his beloved back to the living. Even if it meant losing his soul. As long as he kept telling himself there was no shame.
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq0T976CPSw&t=50s (0:50 - 1:09), Kaleo - Hot Blood:

- *You wanna prove you're the better man;*

- *You wanna reach for the things that nobody can;*

- *Oh all you need is to break away, yeah;*

- *Just keep telling yourself there's no shame.*

___
But where would he go? What could he do? How do you bring back someone that has drowned in the great Summer Sea, when you don't even have a body and when you don't know if this is even feasible?
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=1218s (20:18 - 20:25): ""*You are a gambler [Daario Naharis].""*
___
Well, you gamble. Preferably with a god. Better even, you gamble with the Drowned God!
___
___
___
**A Stormy Mess**
-

So how does a man looking for a favor from the Drowned God end up working with the Sons of the Harpy? To understand this, we need to take a peek under the mask and see what's hiding behind the Harpy.
___
___
In s05e02, Naharis baited Mossador and Daenerys into thinking the Masters of Meereen were behind the underground group opposing her rule.
___
But when Mossador was beheaded, former slaves joined the ranks of the Harpy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4bSCNO3ENg&t=20s (0:20 – 1:05). This suggested that the Masters of Meereen weren't likely to have been pulling the strings: why would former slaves work towards reestablishing slavery when they had barely even tasted freedom?
___
In s05e04, in retaliation to Barristan Selmy being killed, Daenerys fed a living Master to her dragons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_X2GGH_A_0&t=114s (1:54 – 4:36). And in spite of risking being burnt alive, none of the former Masters had anything substantial to say about the Sons of the Harpy. Though they did beg for their lives: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzbUY1SnmIo&t=10s (0:10 -0:29).
___
This strengthened the idea that the Masters of Meereen were innocent. Because if there was one thing the Masters would have valued above slavery, it would have been their own lives.
___
Finally, on the day of the Great Games, any suspicion Daenerys might have had were put to rest when the Sons of the Harpy followed Naharis's advice and gathered all the Great, Wise and Worthy Masters they could find and slaughtered them all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utrGvDu_HKE&t=211s (0:25 – 0:40).
___
At this point, we were running low on suspects. Luckily for the audience, the Master of Whisperers entered the stage, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wifYjB2iOZQ&t=270s (4:30 - 5:58): *""The birds sing in the West, the birds sing in the East, if one knows how to listen.""*
___
Varys had returned.
___
___
S05e10, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wifYjB2iOZQ&t=318s (5:18 - 5:25): *""Information is the key. You need to learn your ennemies' strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.""* - The Spider
___
So far, we had figured that Naharis was not a friend. But even though Daario was clever, he wasn't ingenious enough to have been the founding mastermind behind an underground insurgency group. Besides, when the Sons of the Harpy attacked again in s06e01 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KmQL5sLAPY&t=190s [3:10 - 3:39]), both Jorah and Daario were hundreds of miles away from Meereen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=3845s [1:04:05 - 1:06:55]); well on their way to Vaes Dothrak (https://atlasoficeandfireblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/daeneryss-journey-version-2.png). This meant that neither of them could have been the Harpy. Not that it would have made much sense to begin with.
___
___
S06e01, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KmQL5sLAPY&=157s (2:37 - 2:55): *""The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully. Which means they take orders from someone. [...] My little birds have already taken wing. Soon, they'll return singing songs of men in gold masks.""*
___
It didn't take long for the Master of Whisperers to put his hands on a member of the Sons of the Harpy. In s06e03, Varys questioned Vala, a Meereenese prostitute and acolyte of the Sons of the Harpy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--hRp3IRxyA (0:01 - 3:40). Four minutes later, she was willing to cooperate. And at 5:53, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--hRp3IRxyA&t=353s, the Spider had found out who was funding the Sons of the Harpy: ""*The good masters of Astapor, and the wise masters of Yunkai, with help from their friends in Valantis.""*
___
Such a strange claim. According to the Essosi mummer, the masterminds behind the slaughtering of every Master in Meereen were no one else than: other Slave Masters!
___
Now, remember that the Masters of Meereen were specifically targeted by the Sons of the Harpy, in both of the main attacks: once in the Fighting Pits in s05e09, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utrGvDu_HKE&t=211s (0:25 – 0:40); and a second time during their final assault in s06e10, https://youtu.be/Kv1TKpEOK2I?t=326s (5:26 - 5:45). So if Varys was telling the truth, the good masters of Astapor and the wise masters of Yunkai had wasted lots of money to.. get rid of their former trade partners? What an odd business move.
___
Moreover, why would the Masters have decided to burn Daenerys's ships in s06e01, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KmQL5sLAPY (2:59 - 3:39)? When this was the one thing they had been trying to gift her since season 3, so she would sail away and never return (see the Yunkai'i parley, s03e07).
___
Even when Tyrion negotiated with the Masters in s06e04, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwqm8Khkfsk&t=169s (2:49 - 2:58), they never admitted any ties to the Sons of the Harpy; not even to use as leverage in the negotiation.
___
None of this added up.
___
Besides, if the Sons of the Harpy wanted Meereen back, there were much quicker ways to achieve this: kill Daenerys Targaryen and be done with it, by any means necessary. 
___
Yet, this is the one thing they never even attempted. Look carefully at the Fighting Pit Massacre of s05e09, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utrGvDu_HKE&t=140s (2:20 - 2:40): despite outnumbering Dany's men 100 to 1, the Sons of the Harpy cautiously surrounded her without ever throwing a spear. Which indicated that they wanted to capture Dany alive.
___
But as soon as Drogon landed, they didn't hesitate to use lances: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utrGvDu_HKE&t=284s (4:44 - 5:19). And on the contrary, the second Daenerys walked towards her dragon (5:10), the SotH stopped throwing spears. Any other show, this would have been a classic case of plot armor; but this is Geroge R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones. If the Sons of the Harpy didn't try to kill Dany and her advisers, it was because the Harpy wanted them alive, safe and sound.
___
And if you look attentively at the Fighting Pit Massacre of Meereen, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utrGvDu_HKE, you'll notice the only people the Sons of the Harpy actively tried to kill there were: former slave masters, Unsullied soldiers, and Dany's betrothed, Hizdahr zo Loraq. Every other time Tyrion, Jorah & Daario found themselves in a duel with a Harpy, it was because they were the ones engaging the fight (aside from the occasional rogue SotH). Meanwhile, the Harpies were trying to approach Dany and Missandei as carefully as the situation allowed (in order to kidnap them).
___
Finally, when the Mother of Dragons flew away on Drogon's back, the Harpies immediately withdrew. Despite heavily outnumbering Jorah, Tyrion, Daario and the few Unsullied left, the Sons of the Harpy aborted the mission. Which indicated that the operation was meant only to capture Daenerys, without laying a hand on her advisers.
___
Even when Tyrion and Varys walked through the streets of Meereen in s06e01, unarmed and unguarded, the Sons of the Harpy didn't attack; despite having clear vision of their target: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KmQL5sLAPY (2:28 - 2:47); look at the masked man observing our heros behind the wall.
___
All of this made it glaring the Good Masters of Astapor and the Wise Masters of Yunkai couldn't have been the ones orchestrating the insurgency group.
___
___
On the other hand, this meant that Varys had blatantly lied to Tyrion. Though the drunken Lannister would never see through this trick, in part due to the drugs the Spider had been pouring into his wine since the start of season 6 (see the *""Drunken Hand,""* https://redd.it/bonbil). Coincidentally, this is the time when Tyrion's obsession with eunuch genitalia began: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KmQL5sLAPY&t=25s (0:25 - 0:33).
___
These lies incriminated Varys on every level, therefore suggesting that he might have been the Harpy. But after re-watching Vala's interrogation sequence, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--hRp3IRxyA (0:01 - 3:40), it became apparent that the Meereenese prostitute was genuine; particularly when her son's name was brought into the conversation. Which indicated that up until then, Varys had no idea who the Harpy was.
___
So what did Vala tell the Spider? And why would he lie about it?
___
___
In the end, we had a mysterious & wealthy character concealing his identity under the Mask of the Harpy: a man paying former slaves and free men to spread chaos in Meereen; a man targeting both Daenerys's troops and slavers, while depriving the young Queen of her fleet; a man yearning to kidnap the Breaker of Chains, without laying a finger on her counselors; a man with no morals, getting rid of Dany's groom and of her most honorable adviser, Barristan Selmy. Who could such a man be?
___
We had established that neither Daario nor Jorah fit the characterization of the Harpy. And it couldn't have been Varys either. As per the Slave Masters, they were busy being murdered by the dozen. Who then? Who could be the culprit?
___
In Greek and Roman mythology, the harpy personifies storm winds. And there is only one character in this story that not only associates with storms, but also thinks he is the storm. He is the terror of the world's oceans, from Oldtown to the Jade Sea, Son of the Sea Wind & King of Salt and Rock, the most feared pirate alive: his delusional cruelness, Euron Greyjoy! 
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCMM0ir8-EA&t=173s (2:53 - 3:00), s06e02: *""From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray.""*
___
Euron was the only character rich enough and dreadful enough across the Essosi seas to have had the power to take over a Meereenese underground insurgency group and make them obey his every command. Plus he had been quite transparent about wanting to marry Daenerys, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efwghvZcMRc&t=288s (4:48 - 5:11), s06e05: *""[...] Across the sea, there's a person who hates the great Lord of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I'm going to build that fleet. And I'm going to 'gallivant' right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen, along with my big cock!""*
___
Besides, there were only two factions in the show that used dark and Gothic appearances to put fear in their enemies' heart: the Sons of the Harpy and the Ironborn. And among the Ironborn, there was only one man whose theme matched with the Harpies', https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6MlY-Ku1oc&t=61s (1:01 - 1:45): Euron Greyjoy, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdYU4ZNfFCQ&t=45s (0:45 - 1:21).
___
___
___
**The Gullible Sellsword, the Cheeky Pirate...** 
-

In his quest to find a god, Naharis had stumbled upon the terror of the world's oceans (see Queens Of The Stone Age - No One Knows, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4g21EAVQFU), the self-proclaimed Drowned God himself: Euron Greyjoy.
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCMM0ir8-EA&t=173s (2:48 - 2:54): *""I don't mock the Drowned God, I am the Drowned God.""*
___
It didn't take long for Euron to take advantage of Daario's longing heart. The wealthy pirate swore he would revive Daario's beloved as soon as he was freed from his human prison of flesh and reborn into the god that he is (see *""Justice for the Children,""* https://redd.it/89pzdp). In exchange, all Daario had to do was serve the ""Drowned God"" (i.e. Euron) with his every breath, until that fateful day had arrived. A fair exchange.
___
Of course we, the audience, knew the pirate's real intentions, S06e05, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efwghvZcMRc&t=313s (5:13 - 5:20): *""I'm not going to seduce [the Dragon Queen], the Iron fleet will seduce her. And together, we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms.""*
___
Euron simply wanted the 7 Kingdoms. But Daario didn't know this, and from his perspective, he had to gamble on Euron's proposal.
___
Thereafter, the first order Greyjoy gave his new-found servant was to execute the Second Sons Lieutenants so Dany could add another 2,000 men to her troops.
___
Then, as soon as Meereen was conquered, he had Naharis secure their fleet for the Mother of Dragons: s04e05, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HTDuYpukE&t=1478s (24:38 - 24:54). Thus ensuring Daenerys would have enough ships to sail her armies back to Westeros.
___
However, when the Queen of the Andals realized she could use some political experience and decided to rule Meereen until she had truly helped the people of Slaver's bay find a way to live without slavery, s04e05, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDGlnvBid98&t=124s (2:04 - 3:38), Euron knew he had to act. Realistically, getting rid of slavery is not something one achieves in a lifetime, even with all the power and all the good will in the world. And Euron didn't have a lifetime to spare. He needed Dany and her dragons by his side, rampaging through Westeros. So he would be crowned King of the Seven Kingdoms.
___
To this end, Euron had to make the Queen's reign as difficult and as insufferable as possible. Until she had had enough of Essos and would have set her sights back on Westeros. And one effective way to do that was by leading Meereen to the brink of chaos. Hence Euron taking over the Sons of the Harpy (= Sons of the Storm = Sons of Euron), an underground insurgency group that used guerrilla tactics to wreck havoc on the political stability of the ancient city. Luckily for his cruelness, he was one wealthy and particularly feared pirate, which is why he could afford financing the Sons of the Harpy and how he had managed to take control over most of their actions. 
___
First, Euron had his Sons target the Unsullied to anger Daenerys. Then, he had Daario capture a free man hired as a Son of the Harpy, so his background would incriminate the Masters of Meereen. Finally, after Mossador was executed, former slaves joined his side; which made Euron's job that much easier. By paying former slaves to kill former Masters, Euron made sure the rift between slaves and slavers would only be growing for the foreseeable future. Thus guarantying political instability in the region.
___
But when Daenerys maneuvered to regain control of the city, by offering to marry the former slave trader Hizdahr zo Loraq (s05e05), Euron realized his window of opportunity was dwindling. Which is why he retaliated with the Fighting Pits' Massacre of Meereen in s05e09: a bloodbath that saw Dany's groom bite the dust.
___
The goal of coup was threefold:

- Deepen the rift between slaves & slavers by enrolling former slaves to kill every Master they could get their hands on: thus maintaining Meereen in a perpetual state of chaos;

- Get rid of Daenerys's future husband, Hizdahr zo Loraq: so the Breaker of Chains would be open to Euron's upcoming marriage proposal;

- Kidnap the Mother of Dragons: Here again, Daario's help proved central. Euron's faithful servant led Dany and her men right in the middle of the Fighting Pits, so the Harpies would be able to conveniently surround them (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ-LIOFXzgM&t=268s [4:28 - 4:50]).

___
Once the Sons of the Harpy would have abducted Daenerys, Euron was going to stage his entrance and rescue the Queen of Meereen from her *evil captors;* sacrificing a few of his 'Sons' in the process (for a higher purpose of course). Following this grand introduction, Euron would have earned Dany's affections by offering her the one thing she had desperately been looking for: to learn how to train her dragons. Hence Euron being in possession of Dragonbinder in the books.
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGW1P9vXrsk&t=51s (0:51 - 0:58), s05e01: *""A Dragon Queen with no dragons, is not a Queen.""* - Naharis
___
*In The Winds of Winter, expect Euron to be the one to bring Daenerys to Westeros with his ships (not Yara/Asha). And like the song “Power Is Power” suggested (from SZA, The Weeknd, & Travis Scott), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTkxsPBTrnk&t=28s (0:28 - 0:32): ""And you'll know you're mine when the silence comes"" (i.e. The Silence, Euron's ship); Dany might find true love when Euron brings her back to Westeros and she ends up meeting Jon Stark.  Which would lead to Euron marrying Cersei instead and strangling her to death (with his two good hands). Hence the Valonqar prophecy (as Euron is also a little brother).*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTkxsPBTrnk&t=11s (0:11 - 0:22): ""I was born of the ice and snow; With the winter wolves, in the dark alone."" This is a hint at Jon not being Aegon Targaryen in the books, but the real son of Ned Stark and Ashara Dayne (see ""Aegon Targaryen, A Many Faced Prince -"", https://redd.it/89plsa). Born in the North, with the winter wolves. In the show, Jon was born in the Tower of Joy, neither surrounded by wolves nor ice/snow; and he wasn't alone either.*
___
___
However, in the show, none of this happened. In s05e09, Drogon dashed into the Fighting Pit and rescued his mother; while Dany successfully climbed on his back without any help.
___
This is when Euron realized he would need some other wedding ring; a gift far more valuable to his Queen now that she knew how to ride a dragon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jZymJz-PM4&t=286s (4:46 - 4:57), s07e01: *""In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift, a priceless gift.""*
___
And if Euron knew one thing about Daenerys Stormborn, it was that her majesty loved her ships. Unfortunately for the rogue pirate, a fleet was not something he was easily going to assemble in Essos. Acknowledging this, Euron recognized it was time to leave.
___
The first thing he did before departing was send his right arm, Daario Naharis, to Dany's help (s05e10). Then, he ordered the Sons of the Harpy to burn the Meereenese fleet (s06e01). So that our young Queen would be in dire need of ships when she'd return from Vaes Dothrak. As per Euron himself, he headed back to the finest place one could acquire a navy: his homeland, the Iron Islands.
___
As soon as he landed in Pyke, Euron aimed for the Salt Throne. In s06e02, during a stormy night, he paid the Iron Price by murdering his own brother, Balon Greyjoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCMM0ir8-EA&t=180s (3:52 - 4:13).
___
Then, in s06e05, he claimed the Seastone Chair, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efwghvZcMRc&t=144s (2:24 - 2:32): *""I am Euron Greyjoy. I claim the Salt Throne.""*
___
And after sharing his ambitious plans with the Ironborn, they crowned him King for it, s06e05, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efwghvZcMRc&t=271s (4:31 - 5:20):

- Yara: *""I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.""*

- Euron: *""Bright idea. Expect I'm the one who's going to be build the Iron fleet. Because I'm the one who knows how to use it. I've been all over the world. I've seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea, there's a person who hates the great Lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I'm going to build that fleet. And I'm going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen, along with my big cock! [...] And together, we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms.""*

___
Unfortunately for Euron, his master plan didn't pan out as Yara: stole his fleet, S06e05, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efwghvZcMRc&t=480s (8:00 - 8:35); immediately sailed to Meereen where she offered his ships to Daenerys, s06e09, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58-QKUV8Nl0; then formed an alliance with the Targaryen Queen. All of this before Euron even had a chance to make a case for the value of his big...
___
Witnessing this regrettable turn of events, Euron set his sights back on Westeros, s06e05, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efwghvZcMRc&t=518s (8:38 - 8:59): *""Go back to your homes, chop down every tree you can find, quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks, I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships, and I will give you this world.""*
___
In season 7, the new King of the Iron Islands pivoted towards his second best option at becoming King of the 7 Kingdoms: marrying Cersei Lannister (s07e01), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jZymJz-PM4). And here we thought his pirateness hated the great Lords of Westeros, as he had previously stated at the Kingsmoot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efwghvZcMRc&t=287s (4:47 - 4:56). Such a consistent character.
___
Soon after, the tides turned. Our goofy filibuster got his revenge on Yara and had plenty of fun from season 7 to season 8: miraculously finding himself at the right place at the right time, on every single occasion (see part 8: https://redd.it/bonbil, *""The Spider's Legacy""*). Until he was miserably defeated by a crippled Jaime Lannister, even laughing at his own end (s08e05). So much for ""giving the world"" to his fellow Ironborn.
___
A laughable end to a laughable character.
___
___
With Euron dead, Daario's dreams and efforts at bringing his beloved back to the living also came to naught. In the end, it would seem the clever Daario had put all his eggs in the wrong basket: i.e. a self-proclaimed *""Drowned God,""* who turned out to have been nothing but a simple fraud.
___
Strange, for a man whose intellect we had praised so often in *""The Simplest Man You'll Ever Meet.""*

ecba9r|2019-12-18 11:16:29|[Spoilers] Histories & Lore Full Series|"Been watching the extras on the Season 8 release and been reminded of just how good the histories and lore animated series is. The actual content of them isn't really my thing, far more interested in the characters and the political/family drama behind the events, but it has struck me as an incredibly easy way for HBO to cover a lot more of the Thrones backstory. 

It would not be unrealistic for them to be able to cover the entire history of Westeros and beyond over time, as they wouldn't need the budget for all the filming locations and props - just a good writer and a decent range of voice actors. 

The range of events that could be dramatised is near unlimited, from the age of heroes and the original long night, Robert's Rebellion, the Doom of Valyria, the original wildling invasion, the Dance of Dragons (already going to be part of the new series I assume), the Blackfyre rebellions."|jonathanrmcleod|False|https://redd.it/ecba9r|4|0.72|0|1|1|gameofthrones

ec5ajw|2019-12-18 01:10:31|"[NO SPOILERS] Where does Game of Thrones rank in YOUR ""best of the decade"" TV show list?"|"This is a Thrones subreddit so clearly there is going to be pro-GOT bias, but i've been struck while checking out the various ""best of the 2010s"" lists that different sites/publications are putting out right now, how relatively low Thrones seems to be placed (in some lists Thrones is borderline top 10, and i've seen it ranked as low as 30(!!!) on one list). it's also weird in the same year where there was such massive anticipation for the final season and the show won a Best Drama Series Golden Globe (undeserved for the season in question but still lol) how little fanfare there now seems to be for a show that at one point had a legitimate case to be considered among the best shows of all time and is seen as the last true ""EVERYBODY has seen it""/watercooler show

Still, in your honest opinion what other shows that you've watched this decade matched or surpassed Thrones' overall run quality-wise? in the various lists i've come across, recurring names like Fleabag, Atlanta, Breaking Bad, The Americans and The Leftovers keep popping up among others - of these i've only seen Atlanta and Breaking Bad and i think both are deservedly higher although Atlanta has only done 2 seasons so it hasn't had to try to keep churning out solid work for 5+ seasons (and inevitably drop in quality as a result)

random thought: catching Thrones clips on YouTube and re-watching the Tyrion/Dany scene in Season 7 where they talk about Drogo/Jorah/Daario/Jon, and the ""he's too little for me"" Jon Snow dig reminded me of the 5 or 6 ""Kit Harrington is short"" jokes that D&D put in the final 2 seasons - hell their only on-screen cameo in the series was for them to laugh at one of these jokes as Tormund said it in Season 8. they literally seemed to put more thought into making height jokes than coherently wrapping up the series lol"|DrewDan96|False|https://redd.it/ec5ajw|2|0.63|0|13|1|gameofthrones

ebxaz2|2019-12-17 15:35:32|[SPOILERS] Fixing King's Landing after Season Four|"A lot of people talk about the drop in quality after season four of the show, and while I'm not here to drag the show down, I'm asking what you all would have done to make King's Landing more appealing after S4.

King's Landing often felt like the centre of the show. It's where most of the political scheming happened and the location of the Iron Throne. A huge amount of characters leave after Season 4, leaving the capital a rather empty place by comparison. Tyrion, Varys, Ellaria, Sansa, Littlefinger, Brienne and Podrick leave the city, and Tywin, Dontos, Shae, Oberyn and Joffery are all killed, and the Mountain is turned into a zombie. Jamie spends most of his time away, taking Bronn with him. 

That leaves, Cersei, Margery, Loras, Tommen, Kevan, Mace, Olenna, Pycelle, Qyburn and the Kingsgaurd. That feels like a lot, but a lot of those characters serve pretty basic purposes on the edge of the story. The introduction of the sparrows sure mixes things up but all feels a bit fast - the high sparrow in seven episodes goes from introduction to arresting the queen and basically winning over the city - it makes the Lannisters and Tyrells look like Idiots, and more like a hurdle they must overcome rather than a genuine threat since the sparrows are never mentioned again after 6x10. 

I think it's all to do with the differences from book to screen. In the books, we lose all of our POVs in King's Landing and therefore get to finally see inside the head of Cersei and her wild paranoia fueling her desperate schemes. In the show, we've already seen inside her head many times, and the difference in the way stories are told onscreen means it's not really the same to have Cersei be the protagonist of King's landing because we already know and hate her. 

This leaves a Dilemma - how would you fix King's landing from season 5 onwards? You have to keep S1-4 the same. This isn't a post to complain about the show, simply a fun exercise in what you would do. My own thoughts are down below too."|PucaFilms|False|https://redd.it/ebxaz2|4|0.87|0|2|1|gameofthrones

ebg8dg|2019-12-16 15:04:12|[Spoilers] Littlefinger vs Tywin, a missed rivalry|" I  have always been considering Littlefinger as the true ""Villain"" in the  Song, or the closest thing to a villan, since this saga does not  completely adhere to the good vs evil setting. He ignited the war  between Stark and Lannister Houses, killed Joffrey, used Sansa. He has  no qualms, no honor, no decency to hold him back. He is arguably the  smartest character and has the biggest ambitions.

Yet, he has only a single rival.

Re-watching  today season's 3 episode 4 (although I am considering both books and  show material), I saw how Varys has recognized the threat to the Realm  posed by Littlefinger, thus he plots against him by marrying Sansa to a  Tyrell. I was wondering why the last member of the trio of the very  clever men in the Song, that is, Tywin, did not do the same. It is  rather obvious that he completely underestimated Littlefinger's  potential, ambition and threat level, giving him instead more power by  making him Lord Paramount of the Eyrie.*How come?*  Tywin's inability to correctly assess Littlefinger's profile sounds  really strange to me. If I recall correctly, the Head of the Lannister  does not know the Mockingbird since very long: the latter arrived in  King's Landing under Robert's rule. This is a possible explanation.  Secondly, the fact that Baelish deals with whores, a topic that Tywin  highly despises, may have clouded his judgement.

What  other explanations do you have?  Wouldn't a clash between this two men  have been hugely interesting to you as it would have been to me?"|Timber_Owl|False|https://redd.it/ebg8dg|25|0.87|0|6|1|gameofthrones

Do you think it would have worked and been a good idea if say there could have been another unit shooting prequel material relevant to the overall story that aired intermittently between GOT proper episodes to create time and space for better later seasons.  Things like mini series tales of Dunk and Egg, flashbacks to Roberts Rebellion, original Long Night content to add depth to the Children and Others story etc... Things like that...  Maybe not full seasons but split at the least to slow down the main saga allowing breaks for the main cast and show runners reducing fatigue theoretically.
I was thinking similar to the animated portion of Watchmen but much more elaborate.
Just a few specific examples, full Tower of Joy episode, more Mad King full episodes, Children of the Forest episodes, First Men, select Targaryen historic episodes,  Dunk and Egg, in particular I had this vision of a Young Hodor episode that didn't show us Bran and the Three Eyed Raven with that payoff reveal coming later...
Is any of this interesting, do you think it would have worked, given the cast an crew proper time for other things as to not burn out and a certain two D's not feel the need to sprint toward the end of a marathon...

easdz4|2019-12-15 01:18:24|[Spoilers] GoT is about bad communication|"I'm doing a rewatch and I'm noticing how often important players kept their plans from their allies, generals, and even family members. A lot of times I think this is mostly for dramatic effect (Tyrion doesn't share his battle plan with anyone but Bronn in BoBW). But there's a ton of examples where it's actually part of the plot (Robb doesn't tell Edmure why he wants him to wait to engage the Mountain, which ruins his plans). In fact, Robb Stark's unwillingness to share his plans actively contributed to getting himself killed (among other things). 

Some other notable examples (in no particular order, not exhaustive):

* Ned Stark doesn't tell anyone but Stannis about Joffrey/line of succession
* Lod Commander Mormont doesn't tell members of the Night's Watch the truth about Craster
* Balon Greyjoy does not share his full plans with Theon
* Cersei doesn't tell Jaime about allying with the Greyjoys
* Roose Bolton does not include Ramsey in all of his dealing/planning
* Danearys doesn't Jorah and Barriston Selmy about her plans with the dragons/Unsullied

I could go on and on. Don't get me started on what Bran knows and says nothing about. Anyway, I just thought it was interesting how often this comes up.

eai4sl|2019-12-14 10:18:58|[Spoilers] The Ents and the Children of the Forest are so Similar it's Uncanny!|"I'm surprised no one has talked about this. I've searched the Internet for confirmation and I found nothing. Makes me wonder if I've found something new, something no else has thought about. 



1. Origins and Purpose 

The Children and the Ents were a mysterious humanoid race that once inhabited most of the world which was once covered by dense forests and woodland, before the coming of Men. The Ents were created to protect the forest from those that would destroy it (the dwarves) which is similar to the Children who protect and serve nature. 

2. Age

Both the Children and the Ents are ageless creatures that are probably immortal. Treebeard was said to be the oldest living thing that walked in Middle Earth whereas Leaf of the Children was shown to be alive when the Night King was created, many thousands of years before the events of GoT Season 1.

3. Appearance

The Ents and the Children are very tree like, though the Ents more so, but also very much like humans; body, two arms, two legs, head with hair and human facial features.

4. How the World Sees Them

Both races are considered to be a fairytale by most people, a mere myth. No one knows much about them, if at all. The only people that do know about them is the ancient race of humans that came into contact with them thousands of years ago, the elves in LOTR and the First Men in GoT.

5. How They See The World

Both races hate the destruction of nature and those that would commit such an act. The Ents hate orcs and show aggression towards dwarves who wield axes. Generally, they distrust outsiders and live in isolation from the rest of the world. The Children are somewhat similar. They live far away from the rest of the world, in complete isolation. They hate the forces of evil and probably hate the Andals for cutting down the heart trees."|Wodan1|False|https://redd.it/eai4sl|6|0.7|0|4|1|gameofthrones

&#x200B;

This is my first post in this subreddit and I'm not really sure if this the right place but here goes. I'm myself a book purist and have been following the show on and off and consider them to be entire two different canons. So perhaps that is why I'm not too passionate about the season 8 and its conclusion. But I haven't been living under a rock and I've heard that many people are displeased with the direction and the ending. Many people, both in real life and internet had told me that the ending was not right and that the show was not finished correctly. 

&#x200B;

That gets my nogging jogging every time. Since no one has told me what the ""correct"" ending for the show would be. Do you people have any thoughts about that particular subject? If you do, I'd like to hear them."|HerrasKissa|False|https://redd.it/ea827r|1|0.5|0|10|1|gameofthrones

e9z8b8|2019-12-13 04:40:23|[Spoilers] Reasoning Behind the Number of Episodes in Season 8?|"To me, this ended up being the biggest red flag for season 8 especially with the team trying to nail the landing for the end of the series. Season 7 came out in July 2017, and it took longer for them to shoot Season 8 than any other season. This is where I am conflicted about the complaints about the the writers rushing or wanting to move on from GoT and not caring, because they seemed content with delivering season 8 the way they planned. I don't think they anticipated the backlash that season 8 got and it makes me wonder if anyone questioned some of these decisions and what the true reasons were for cutting the episode count. I never heard a good explanation for the final season having just 6 episodes (I read an article where I believe Dan said they thought the series should last 73 hours and that was that...I don't get that at all).

Can anyone help explain how everyone involved was patient with every aspect of the final season to the point where they skipped an annual release date, but were adamant that 6 episodes would be enough for the series to wrap up the story without things feeling rushed? To me, extending the episode lengths did not feel like it provided any more depth or valaue compared to doing the same thing over a longer period and having the opportunity to add more scenes and to allow the viewer to digest everything that was crammed into 6 episodes.

In a way I feel bad for David and Dan because I have no doubt that they believed they were handling the final season the right way, but I remember feeling anxious the moment I heard about season 8 having 6 episodes. That decision alone backed everyone into a corner and made it impossible to flesh out the major storylines like Dany's turn, Bran's ascension and Jon's fate. I enjoyed the final season more than most people but my biggest gripe was how they didn't explain or show what happened after Drogon flew away with Dany, and led us to believe that Jon confessed and surrendered to the Unsullied reacted by peacefully putting him in a cell. Instead they skipped ahead 3 weeks when they could have dedicated a few episodes to the fallout of that scene and how the Starks reacted and came to his rescue from the North. Also...how could Arya let him rot in a cell for weeks without planning to get him out?"|Moss27|False|https://redd.it/e9z8b8|9|0.74|0|21|1|gameofthrones

The battle for kings Landing seems to be really similar to the final battle in the capital. President Snow allows all the civilians to enter the gates to his mansion, and while they’re entering, President Coin bombs the civilians. There are other subtle similarities too, like Gale and Katniss wearing hooded cloaks to try and enter with the civilians to assassinate Snow. And of course Coin, the supposed Hero ending up as the final villain.

ea3ejf|2019-12-13 12:30:27|[Spoilers] (kinda) I've decided to rewrite my own Season 8 script because I hated the original. Here's my general plot for episode 3.|"I've changed quite a lot and killed a bunch more characters that become pretty useless in the following episodes as I'm going to write them. I'd love some feedback!

After I make a general outline for the entire plot of the season I am going to write the actual script. It's going to be a passion project that will probably take me quite a while to complete since I do stuff on YouTube as well as some art irl, and I'm working on my own original scripts.

Episodes 1 and 2 remained pretty much the same because I quite liked them. They were also not surprisingly NOT written by D&D...

One change in my version of episode 2 is that Yara arrives at Winterfell with Theon, because I felt like she was totally wasted in the original, so she's fighting with Theon in the Godswood in 3.

I hope you like it! :D

I also later came up with how to incorporate Bran's powers instead of just having him sit there like a vegetable all night:

- When Bran says ""I'm going to go now"" he uses the crows to scan the battle field but also to attack with them where he's needed most, instead of being a useless fuck all night. At some point after Arya meets Melissandre Bran uses the crows to gangs up on a giant that attacks Arya, and the Hound stays behind to finish it off with a spear that he pulls out of a dead body. While Arya runs off into the shadows the Hound is forced to rejoin the battle alongside Gendry.

- The Winterfell hounds are also protecting Bran in the Godswood with Theon. Once the arrows run out they launch themselves at the wights with Bran in control."|TheNoobestGirl|False|https://redd.it/ea3ejf|0|0.4|0|12|1|gameofthrones

e9t3nt|2019-12-12 20:27:22|[SPOILERS] One idea to make the Daenerys arc more believable.|"Pondering after episode 5 this is an idea for how they could have done things so that her transformation would have been way more believable, my main goal was to have a series of events after Wich its believable that she destroys the entire city. (I apologise in advance for any grammar errors I'll make) 



Dany is marching on kingslanding, as she does rumor starts to spread that cersei is responsible for blowing up the cept and people in kingslanding start riled up against cersei, and supporting dany. Cersei wants the lay down the law but qyburn says he can fix this, he start a propaganda campaign against Dany, talking about all the bad things she has done, that she is using an army of slaves and kills anyone who e is against her.

People in Kings landi g are devided, some believe Dany is the one that will save them from cersei but a majority sees cersei as the one hope left to defend them against this new tyrant and big groups of people start protesting  against Dany in the street.

In a meeting with the council News of this gets to Dany heard how people in the streets are protesting against her, thrashing her name. She gets furious and says she should show no merci for these Thankles people. How if they are against her then she is against them. Tyrion, knowing from varys of the propaganda campaign calms her down, explaing that they hate her based on wrong information and that there are still people that support her in the city. 

*""don't do things that would make the lies they spread the truth""*

He convinces her and she agrees not to use her dragons inside the city as the risk of hurting innocent is to great.

Day of the battle she flies along the wall and destroys all the ballistas, the soldiers break into the city but when the soldiers retreat, they are at a huge disadvantage as in the small streats they are easy prey for the archers that are positioned inside the houses. Civilians are helping them throw stuff on top there heads and help with the fighting.

A soldier goes back to Dany to report of the trap that was basically set up and how the civilians are helping. Obviously angry she rushes to her dragon, teyrion tries to stop her, reminds her of her promise not to use her dragon. She ignores him and flies away.

As she flies over the city she sees her army in distress, seeing how the city is helping cersei. How they are against her and we see her get more and more angry. As she flys stil in the air to look down on the situation suddenly he dragon makes a big dive down. As she struggles to get him under control and fly up again we see a big bolt sticking out of his chest. The dragon havi g trouble flying flyes up and we see Dany look in the direction where the bolt must have come from.

She doges a new bolt and she sees a smaller bolt thrower, Being operated by... Civilians! We see her eyes turn angry, we see her think if that's how you want it, that's what you'll get. she flys up and dives down towards the bolt and drogon starts spewing fire...

Then she destroys the city like in the show. 

Its not perfect but I thought it was pretty decent. Thank you if you have read it fully and don't forget:

The Red Woman. 

How I love her “cultured” look and that exotic face, with a highly underrated body. And however screwed up it may be, there’s also something really sexy about a woman that’s so dedicated to her beliefs. 

She has this strange aura about her that is mysterious in a way few of the characters are. I wish I could explain it exactly, but I can’t. But it makes her all the more appealing.

e9e20o|2019-12-11 22:06:28|[Spoilers] I think there was more to Shae|"I personally think that it was supposed to be revealed that Shae was not a bad person in the end. At least in the show, that is.

Shae obviously had feelings for Tyrion - she got jealous when he was around other women, she respected his wishes and disliked those who spoke badly of him. She even helped Sansa by giving her advice to stay clear of Littlefinger, and she even went out of her way to stop the maid from telling others that Sansa began menstruating. 

If Shae was working for Tywin all this time, she wouldn't try so hard to keep Tyrion out of trouble. She'd reveal information about him to Tywin asap, and this would have all have finished much sooner. 

I also don't think that Shae betrayed Tyrion due her anger towards him when he sent her away. Shae is a very rational person, she doesn't let emotions get the best of her.

It's more like Tywin blackmailed her or threatened to hurt someone she cares about, maybe her family? We don't know much about them, except Shae hinting that they were important people. Maybe Tywin found out who she was and could have threatened to hurt them or reveal her activities to them?

I personally think that Shae was pregnant with Tyrion's child, and if Tywin threatened to kill her, he'd kill the child within her as well. She would have to play along with Tywin's demands to testify against Tyrion, and maybe by sleeping with Tywin she'd be able to pretend her child is Tywin's, so the lives of her and her unborn child would be spared."|Lumos_night|False|https://redd.it/e9e20o|3|0.56|0|22|1|gameofthrones

e80rzz|2019-12-08 22:42:18|[SPOILERS] ASOIAF Ending Theory|"
I was re-reading the books when something occurred to me.
I don't think Jon will kil Daenerys.
And before all of you scream bloody murder, hear me out. She will still go full Mad Queen but Jon won't be the one who kills her, I just don't think it co insides with his character arc. I actually feel like it made sense in the show but in the books not so much. Instead it will be (F)Aegon

Firstly Jon is in the book smarter then he is in show, I think book Jon would make smarter choices.
Secondly I believe Jon and (F)Aegon's storyline got mixed up in the Show. I really believe that he and Daenerys will have a marriage/alliance arc like Jon had with Daenerys in season 7.

Thirdly Rickon has a chance to survive in the books.
I could see Jon helping Rickon bleeding for him during the Battle of The Bastards, and then being pushed away by them and the Lord's due to Littlefingers or maybe Wyman Manderly's Schemes.

Fourthly His Parantage. This is a weird thought but I don't think we can be so sure of his Parantage in the books. Believe me I really believe in R+L=J but even if that's still the truth there is a chance he is the Blackfyre of the story. He should at least have a different name unless George wants multiple Aegon's running around. ( My Money is on Aemon )
I could also see him being Brandon's Son, in my opinion that would make an even better story.

Lastly Jon's Ending, I think Jon might become a King Beyond the wall. His season 8 ending felt doubled.
It would have made a more specific ending if Jon was executed. Because that would have even more driven home that he got the short end of the stick.
But he got a pretty mellow ending. Nothing noteworthy really, with him going north once more.
Again it might have more to do with it being to different endings but forced upon one character.

To summarize, I think that Jon and Aegon's story got mashed together the show. And that because of it we will have a different end to the story."|Beafyre|False|https://redd.it/e80rzz|3|0.64|0|4|1|gameofthrones

Just reached the end of season three, been binging pretty hard and got through 30 episodes in the last four days. 

In my mind I always ranked Season 1 up there as being one of the best, with a drop off for Season 2 and 3 in comparison. But I've totally changed my mind this time round. Coming from having just finished watching the Season 8 4K before starting Season 1 I found the gratuitous brothel scenes  used at almost every opportunity a real distraction and really noticed how limited the production was for the first season. Sure there are some phenomenal individual scenes, like Robert and Cersei discussing their marriage, Ned and Arya, Arya and Syrio, etc, but can you really go back and rewatch some of the Littlefinger scenes and not think a) they were terribly produced b) completely unnecessary and c) the sex was being used to distract from this fact. 

I'm not someone who takes offence at the sex and nudity in Game of Thrones, in fact I think it's prevalence is essential in many scenes. It just really stood out how much background ""sexposition"" was being used to cover up a very limited budget."|jonathanrmcleod|False|https://redd.it/e7jjjq|9|0.77|0|9|1|gameofthrones

e7a8dw|2019-12-07 05:11:17|[SPOILERS] Why the defense of Winterfell was so poorly planned (FACTS)|"Looking @ the defense of Winterfell one cannot help but cringe @ how shitty a plan it is. Yeah you can kinda understand the dothraki's all out charge as they were seen as the most feared military force in open field and had never been defeated in open field plus it made for a cool shot. But then you remember they don't have valeryian steel or dragon glass swords so if mellisande hadn't showed up the dothraki's wouldn't be able to kill any of the Army of the Dead.Now on to the real dumbass shit why are there troops outside the walls and if you are going to put troops there maybe don't create a narrow blockade behind them as it creates a bottleneck.   In addition the trebuchets need to be behind the soilders as they were useless after the first shot. There are dozens of stupid mistakes you can go over but instead of going over the what I want to talk about why.

Looking @ westeros in season 8 all of the best battle commanders / strategist are dead. Tywin, Robb, Stannis, The Black Fish, the Bolton's, Robert Baratheon, randyl tarly and the commanders who do remain are Jon Snow, Greyworm, Jaime,

So let's go over these men's resume one by one

Jon Snow: the man is a born leader but he is more of a fighter then a planner just look @ the battle of the bastard where he charged on horseback @ the Bolton's @ winterfell despite being outnumbered, by himself, and he eventually got saved by pure plot armour. But he shouldn't have ever march against the Bolton's until he had the numbers. Great fighter not a great strategist

Greyworm: another great fighter but he is simply a man who follows the orders of his queen. He has never really planned an attack but instead has always completed the task given to him.

Jaime: as you can see all these men are fighters not strategist and Jaime's plans straight up suck he got outmonuvered by Robb then Dany."|epapali|False|https://redd.it/e7a8dw|0|0.29|0|10|1|gameofthrones

e70zm4|2019-12-06 16:31:01|[Spoilers] The 'Game Of Thrones' Timeline Is Completely Nonsensical Before Seasons 7-8|"What do I mean by this? Well I am referring to the fact that the people in charge of the show have definitively stated that each season is supposed to equal one year of storytelling, while also writing the show in such a way that directly contradicts that. For the sake of an example I will outline the time passage of Jon Snow's story line through season 5 of the show, to show that there is no way in hell that it takes place over five years. Here we go:

* Alright firstly we can safely say that season 1 episode 4 to season 2 episode 1 is six months. Why? Because at Craster's Keep Samwell says he hasn't seen a girl in six months. That would suggest that he has been at Castle Black for six months, because he arrived in episode 4.
* Later during their stay at Craster's Keep, in episode 2 (which seems to take place on the same day in universe or close to it) Gilly states that she is pregnant and asks Samwell to take her with them, because she is concerned about her baby. So that puts the maximum amount of time between Season 2 episode 2 and Season 3 episode 4 at roughly 9 months.
* So from episode 4 of season 1 to episode 4 of season 3, we're looking at 15 months or so. six months of seeing no girls, nine months for Gilly's pregnancy. Now Craster's Keep is stated by Jon in episode 4 of season 4 to be 60 miles north of The Wall. Samwell and Gilly make it back there in episode 10 of season 3. Now yes, we do not have a definite amount of time that it took them to get back. Logically speaking however, are we supposed to believe it took them more than a month to walk 60 miles, while they have basically no supplies and a baby to look after. They would be moving as fast as they can. So lets put that at around a month, equaling out to walking two miles a day.
* So that is episode 4 to episode 30 = 16 months. Now we are in season 4. Jon is still in pain from his wounds, but he is talking about Robb like he's recently received the news of his death. you can say it's been maybe a couple of weeks for him. nothing happens in episode 2, and episode 3 has Grenn and Edd return from Craster's Keep, introducing a state of emergency regarding Mance finding out how few men Castle Black actually has. lets say this takes place a month into the season. This isn't something they're going to sit on for very long. I would give it max a week before the events of Season 4 episode 4 occur, where they decide to leave for Craster's. Now remember, that is 60 miles north of the wall, and it is really urgent that they get there as fast as possible. But if you really want to say that they moved at 2 miles a day like I said Sam did, then fine. Thats 2 months from Season 4 Episode 3 to Season 4 Episode 7 when they return to Castle Black. In episode 7 they say that Mance Rayder was closing in on Craster's when they left, and that he'd be there before the next full moon. Add on one more month and there, the battle happens and that is season 4's timeline wrapped. Roughly 4 months.
* Episode 4 to Episode 40 = 19 Months. This next point will be smaller. Stannis arrives at Castle Black in the finale of season 4. The events of season 5 pick up immediately after. in episode 3 Stannis says he will leave Castle Black in a fortnight, which equals two weeks. They way the show is written and how the characters interact suggest that everything before episode 3 takes place relatively soon before that. So we can say with A LOT of confidence that from episode 1 to 5 of season 5, it's less than a month, but let's give it a month for the sake of it. Why not? In episode 5 of season 5 Jon also makes the deal with Tormund to head to Hardhome and save the wildlings. Now this is also a urgent mission, and it won't take much time to prepare for. Maybe a few days. Jon leaves for Hardhome in episode 7. Now I really don't want to throw on another month for that event, because it seems ridiculous considering the circumstances. So let's say that also takes place within a month of the season starting. Jon says that Tormund could make it to Hardhome by horse in a week, but they travel to Eastwatch and go that way, which I imagine would take longer. For the sake of simplicity lets assume that it's a month travel both ways, a there and a month back, considering all problems that are encountered. That's three months from the starting of the season, to episode 9 of the season. Final point on season 5, I highly doubt that they mutineers waited a month to betray Jon but lets say that they did. Season 5 is also four months.
* Episode 4 to Episode 50 = 23 Months. We have reached the end of season 5 from my starting point in episode 4. What happens before episode 4? Jon, Robb, and Bran watch Eddard execute the deserter. Later that day Eddard receives notice that Robert is on his way to Winterfell. When they arrive Cersei says they had been on the road for a month. In episode 5 Maester Luwin says Catelyn waited by Bran's bedside for 3 weeks before leaving, and that was well after everyone had already left. Lets assume that it took them two weeks maybe to prepare and then set out. Lets say that for whatever reason it took the same amount of time for Jon to travel to the wall with Benjen that it did for Eddard to travel to King's Landing. Why? Because the scene Jon gets news that Bran is awake, plays out a scenario that would seemingly take place within a few days of arrival and Eddard needs that time to get to King's Landing. Listing all of this out, lets generalize and say that the first three episodes play out over three months. that brings us up to 26 months. Now comes the question of how long is the gap between episode 3 and episode 4. Jon seems to have developed his friendship with the others at least a little bit. To answer that question I would point to Daenerys' plot line, and how her pregnancy kind of solidifies the length of the season's storytelling. For the sake of simplicity, lets say that season 1 actually does somehow take place over the course of a year/12 months.
* So to summarize. Season 1 = 12 months. Season 2 = 5 months. Season 3 = 5 months. Season 4 = 4 months. Season 5 = 4 months. Totaling an astounding 30 months, or two and a half years for the first five seasons of the show. Half of how much time had supposed transpired at this point. Also coincidentally how much time apparently has passed in the books up to this point in the story.  I have a lot more information about this that helps to mess up the timeline of the show, this is just what exists in Jon's story line. For the fun of it, I can absolutely point out other huge problems regarding the timeline the show has set up. But regardless of that, does this bother anyone else? I know it's a small thing from an otherwise master class show, but I feel like this isn't the hardest thing to do right, and it's just something that no cares to acknowledge. The show's timeline problems have on;y become ever the more apparent during the most recent season (7) and are even likely to increase more before the show's end. Now please, tell me how ridiculous I am for letting this be the thing that bothers me the most about the show. My rationale is that the show breaks itself when the simple passage of time is completely inconsistent and nonsensical."|sucorred|False|https://redd.it/e70zm4|2|0.55|0|7|1|gameofthrones

e4ryxr|2019-12-02 02:13:04|[Spoilers]What D&D Should Have Done|"For the first 4-5 seasons, the show didn't use that many screenwriters.  This made sense as they were pretty much just adapting the source material.  If you look at the writing credits for each episode, it's almost always either D&D, Bryan Cogman, and one or two others, with GRRM sometimes stepping in to do one episode a season.

Once they ran out of book material to adapt, what they should have done is extremely obvious in hindsight: hire a staff of seasoned writers and set up a real writer's room, the kind almost every scripted series would normally have.  I'm not saying they should have completely changed the writers, as that would have felt jarring.  Benioff, Weiss, and Cogman would still have been the main writers and overseen everything, but they also would have had a large writing staff to work with.  In Season 6, the show went from being an adaptation to a completely original story, and given the large number of characters and subplots who needed to come up with conclusions that even GRRM himself hasn't finished, a large staff was the best way to handle this.

Instead, D&D just took the entire workload on by themselves.  The two of them had to be the showrunners on the largest and most expensive TV production in history while also trying to write the ending themselves to a story that had no ending, that was conceived by someone else on such a large and vast scale, and in a short amount of time.

We'll never know how things would have turned out otherwise, but having a larger staff of writers certainly wouldn't have hurt."|CalvinValjean|False|https://redd.it/e4ryxr|16|0.72|0|16|1|gameofthrones

Hi!
    I am not sure if this is the best place to post for what I am going to ask, but if it isn’t I hope you can give me the best contact info. My boyfriend loves Ms. Clarke as an actress, and admires her strength deeply. This year he (David) has survived two brain aneurisms. He has carried through with nothing but strength and hope since February 2019. December 5, 2019 he will finally receive a multiple time postponed surgery to remove the tumor causing the two aneurisms, as well as near daily seizures. Surgery week has arrived, and he is terrified. So scared he won’t wake up, or that something with be wrong with his brain afterwards. It’s a long shot to ask, but he’s worth it. Talking about Ms. Clarke gave him some hope again. If she does an even ten second video saying good luck David, I would be eternally grateful. Thank you for taking the time to read this and hope you guys can point me to some publicist contact info or something!"|Jferrara31|False|https://redd.it/e47ul1|41|0.91|0|9|1|gameofthrones

e2vog7|2019-11-28 09:20:07|[SPOILERS] How GRRM will finish the story?|"Possibly, you are really disappointed with how D&D have finished the show. I really don't know have D&D consulted with GRRM about the ending. If you have some information about that, please, let me know. I can say only two things:

1. D&D have closely worked with GRRM in the last season. It means that GRRM consulted them about the ending, which he knew for several years and already made it up. This means, the ending of the show is also the ending of GRRM.
2. GRRM didn't work with D&D in the last season. The ending of the show is the work of D&D. They possibly do not know the ending of GRRM. Maybe GRRM refused to talk about it, because HBO didn't give money. This means, the ending of GRRM may be different. He already mentioned that the ending is the same and not the same at the same time.

I'm really excited about what GRRM will write. The first book of Game of Thrones published in 90's. He lives with these characters for 30 years already. Possibly, he thinks about them everyday. Possibly, he already knows his ending. And I hope that it will be a masterpiece."|minimalist07|False|https://redd.it/e2vog7|0|0.35|0|12|1|gameofthrones
