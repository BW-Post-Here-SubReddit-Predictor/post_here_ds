eh8a0p|2019-12-29 17:02:25|What makes you so sure there is no god? (Not intended as a challenge more curious than anything)|"So I am not religious by any means. I was raised conservative Christian and believe approximately 0% of that. 

That being said, I am personally agnostic. I just see it as we don’t have a firm 100% understanding of how the singularity came to be initially. I’ll admit we’re getting pretty damn close to a scientific understanding and a lot of those answers I still don’t firmly grasp. It just doesn’t seem so far fetched or impossible anyway, that some (probably uncaring) higher being started all this. 

It’s just something I don’t think we can currently know   for sure. To me the viewpoint of there is absolutely no way a god exists at all, feels to be pretty similar to saying there’s definitely (insert god here) watching over us. Just kind of a two sides of the same coin type of thing (imho and by no means do I claim to know it all or have some kind of “better” viewpoint). 

Again not trying to talk shit, just genuinely curious about what makes you believe so strongly in non-belief. (Also if I’m misinterpreting atheist beliefs please correct me!) 

Or am I possibly missing something and atheism/agnosticism are used interchangeably or to varying degrees?

*Edit - Thank you for your viewpoints here! Definitely read quite a few well thought out perspectives and I appreciate that! 


I really am just looking to challenge my own beliefs and appreciate the people defending/explaining theirs. It helps me reevaluate my own for sure. 

To answer the many “well why don’t you believe in xyz” it’s kind of a dishonest question. I don’t “believe” unicorns/leprechauns/etc exist. But I still wouldn’t say with certainty they don’t/will never exist.

**Edit 2 - Thanks again but at this point seems I’m more being redirected to the FAQ and having other replies missing the points I’ve made so I’m turning off notifications. 

After being more well informed I can clearly communicate my question was for strong atheists. Received some great (and partially over my head) answers from people in that camp and I am now much more appreciative of that perspective."|robbie5643|False|https://redd.it/eh8a0p|461|0.93|0|746|1|atheism
ekue3k|2020-01-06 13:50:39|I find it pretty sad that Notre dame raised a billion dollars when it caught fire and Australia has not even raised more then 25 million.|"it just seems pretty sad that that people threw tons of money at an old church with a shitty history. Many people argued that rebuilding it was not worth it and the 1 billion could have been used to actually help France.

meanwhile, half a billion animals have died as Australia burns, where are all the donations now? it's pretty telling that religious people care more about an old empty building then actual life.

ektqdx|2020-01-06 12:49:13|"Hell vs Omnipotence: my favorite challenge to Christians and Muslims, beside the fact that both have the problem of no hell being in the ""Old Testament"" (aka God ""forgot"" to mention it until the Greeks made it up). References included:"|"The definition of the word CRUELTY is ""extreme indifference to suffering, or deliberate infliction of pain and suffering.""

Sometimes suffering is necessary. Justice is the consequence of your actions, karma, reaping what you sow, etc. If you ignore your mom and touch a hot stove, you'll have to deal with suffering. That's a necessary consequence; that's necessary suffering. In some societies, if you rape, you'll be castrated. 

But causing suffering when there is no need for it? That's considered cruelty.

With this in mind here is some of my favorite ammo.  Hopefully it comes in handy in discussions you have, or helps someone who's exploring these issues as they begin to doubt their dogma. 

1. God is OMNIPOTENT (Revelation 19:6b, Job 42:2)

“Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns."" - Revelation 19:6b (""Almighty"" means ""omnipotent"")

""“I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted."" - Job 42:2

2. God created all of the Universe's laws (Jeremiah 33:25, Romans 1:20, Genesis 9:12-13, Nehemiah 9:6, Colossians 1:16-17)

""You alone are the LORD. You made the heavens, even the highest heavens, and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything, and the multitudes of heaven worship you.""

""For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:  And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.""

3. God can make EXCEPTIONS to those laws. (Daniel 4:35, Job 9:7)
""All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, and he does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, “What have you done?”"" 

""If he commands it, the sun won't rise and the stars won't shine."" 

4. Therefore, God's laws are only as necessary as he wills them to be (he can suspend his own decisions/laws/plans at will) (Psalms 115:3, Daniel 4:35)

""And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can restrain his hand, or say unto him, What do you?""

""But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.""

5. God does not WANT people to suffer for eternity (1 Timothy 2:3-4 , 2 Peter 3:9)

""God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved. "" 

""The Lord is ... not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.""

However when it comes to America going to war for no reason over the last 100 years it seems like a majority of religious people put “patriotism” or national pride first for reasons I will never grasp.

Examples of this are WWI, Spanish American war, Vietnam, Iraq, Iran.  Obviously some stick with their principles and even go to jail for that but it seems like people out nationalism first.  What do you think we can do as Humans to reverse this pathetic trend in Christianity and other religions.

ekvop9|2020-01-06 15:37:14|Reasons I Became An Atheist|"I was a bit of a late bloomer when I began to realize God doesn't exist. It started when my christian high school had us all gather in an auditorium to watch Bill Nye and Ken Ham debate each other. I don't remember much about the debate itself, but I remember feeling a strange comfort in the idea that this big guy in the sky who's constantly looking over my shoulder, threatening to throw me into the eternal pits of hell doesn't exist. Later I learned in the 2nd chapter of Job, not only is it revealed that Satan needs God's permission to harm people, but God was tempted by Satan AND HE TOOK THE BAIT. This blew my mind, everything I ever learned about this perfect loving being was wrong. To me this meant either he existed and was actually this horrible deity, or it was all fake. Even after that, I tried to convince myself I was wrong, I guess that's what brainwashing does to you.

I began thinking that even if God doesn't exist, at least the idea created good people through the christian community. I was wrong. I started seeing it everywhere after that, horrible christian after horrible christian. I had a teacher tell us that we should hate gay people, and when I asked him why God would want us to hate anyone he suddenly changed his tone, stopped teaching, and started trying to be quirky and tell jokes. I guess it worked because nobody brought it up ever again. I had a family member who constantly verbally abused their kids, once screaming in their toddler's face to ""fuck off"". They've been the head of multiple worship teams. I told my youth pastor that I was depressed and considering suicide, they tried to blackmail me into telling everyone and saying God made me better for the sake of christian propaganda. I had a childhood friend who was dying, so in desperation I pleaded during my school's prayer times for the teachers to ask God for a miracle. They simply prayed saying ""we hope they were a christian"", and a miracle never came. After that, I fully realized either God doesn't exist, or he doesn't give a shit about us.

I've never admitted to anyone that I'm an atheist. My entire family is christian and most of my friends are christian, so it's not something I can just say. That's really the whole purpose of this post, I want to finally admit, more so to myself than anyone else, that I'm an atheist and my life has been much better because of it."|duvnin|False|https://redd.it/ekvop9|21|0.85|0|7|1|atheism

 “Separation of church and state” allows the churches to not pay taxes like normal business or people, so it should also follow that the church should *also* stay “separate” from discussing politics during their sermons. If the church wanted to take part in politics, it should’ve opted to pay taxes like the rest of American voters. 

Furthermore, the main reason I see the church getting involved at all is because they want to convince their attendees to “vote how Jesus would’ve voted”.  Translation: “abortion is BAD, cause it goes against the 10 commandments!! So we MUST support the Republicans, because they support life!! And the Democrats are BAD because to God, they’re MURDERERSS!” 

Don’t you see how childish, naive, and biased the church can be in instances like this? It is juvenile, and the church shouldn’t be trying to influence those who might be gullible, sheep, and/or politically ignorant within their audiences by telling them to “vote Republican” just because “the bible tells us so”.  

Instead, churches should  stick to their sermons, and mind their business and allow their attendees to be able to think independently and form their own opinions and make their own voting decisions. 

I’ve seen it too often (as someone who grew up in the Christian church—- and is now agnostic) and it needs to stop, imo.

He was the kindest person I had ever met, he did not deserve to die in anyway. He was diagnosed with bone cancer 6 months before his death and told none of his friends. He has always been the kind of person to keep to himself and try not to be a burden on other people. His death was a shock to all of us and it was very unexpected. 

Anyways, after his death, I got a lot of comments from people at my school. I have been told that his death was gods plan and that logan was ready to die. That he deserved to die because god wanted him to.

That shit made me so mad and I couldn’t even say anything. I understand people have different beliefs about death, but at least have some fucking respect. I personally believe there is nothing after death. No souls, no afterlife, no ghosts, nothing. Like i didn’t even get to say goodbye to my friend. Now he’s gone forever and people are saying he was destined to die?!? Idk it just seems messed up to me. He was 17 years old. He was not ready to die.

Edit: Wow I did not expect this to blow up, I was honestly just ranting. Thanks to the people who gave me gold. Just to clarify, my friend Logan was an atheist.

Nothing catastrophic happened, just some houses fell off their pillars, smashed some cars and a nature made monument sadly was destroyed.

Now, whenever one of these happens, people quickly take to social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) just to become fear-mongers and say that the end of times are coming.

ekv420|2020-01-06 14:52:34|Why atheists talk about religion|"Here's something I wrote in response to a newcomer who asked yet again why atheists talk so much about religion. I decided it was so good it deserves its own thread.

Atheism is simply the lack of belief in any gods. What part of atheism confuses you?

Atheism is such a simple idea, I don't think it's possible to be confused--unless some religious person told you something about atheism that simply isn't true and you believed it. In that case, you might feel confused as to why you're not seeing what you expected to see. It is religion that confuses people, not atheism. Religion is so complicated it's hard to understand, but when you understand it properly, it collapses like a house of cards, due to all its internal contradictions and weaknesses. When religion collapses, it leaves atheism in its place. The only way to approach atheism is to get rid of religion. Once you are rid of religion and all the confusing things it taught you, you will understand atheism perfectly.

(I thought of writing more, elaborating on the extended metaphor of religion being an ugly and useless warehouse that has collapsed, leaving behind a clear view of the horizon, but maybe that would be overkill.)

EDIT: Further thoughts: When you get rid of religion, you have atheism, just like when you get rid of illness, you have health, or when you get rid of dirt, you have cleanness. There's nothing complicated about cleanness; you don't really have to explain what it is; it's just the lack of dirt. Dirt, on the other hand, and the process of getting rid of it can be very complicated. So atheists talk about religion in the same way that doctors talk about diseases, janitors talk about dirt, and firefighters talk about fire. There's nothing much to say about the lack of dirt or the lack of fire, or the lack of belief in gods.

I think the confusion comes in when newcomers, without thinking about it much, expect atheists to do what religions do: that is, lecture people on what they should do or shouldn't do in order to live a better life, or maybe they expect us to debate about how to live a better life. We can do those things, but we don't consider that part of atheism."|JimDixon|False|https://redd.it/ekv420|6|0.69|0|20|1|atheism

ekxszp|2020-01-06 18:11:10|Prophecies from an old hack resurging|"Im posting here because I lack a physical community of non-believers to help strengthen my resolve. I grew up in a fundamentalist doomsday cult... so the indoctrination runs deep. I finally came to terms with what that meant to me as an adult and have been pretty good at simply not listening to ""crazy"" anymore. Even entertaining the old theological ideas to refute them feels a bit dangerous, as I was taught to believe some pretty outlandish things and am too realistic to believe I've purged all those beliefs at a fundamental level. 

The cult I was part of has demonstrably failed numerous, numerous prophecies about geopolitics and the end times. I understand that should end the argument plain and simple. If you spew enough garbage predictions, one has a chance to come true by sheer coincidence. I understand that intellectually, but this past week caused a bit of a resurgence of fear. 

I remember being terrified of Russians killing me as a small child (Im from the US). Crying myself to sleep because I thought I'd die from an invasion before I could prove myself worthy in god's eyes was a common theme when I was 6 or so. The specific prophecy that was repeated to me is a fairly common one among those who believe in british-israelism: That Russia and Iran, along with Turkey, Libya and a few others would attack Israel in to start off the end times. It looks like they'll win, but then the Russian army is defeated by sky fairy magic (or by a barrage of missiles that he willed to be built earlier on.. Later on, China allies with the defeated Russia and a US city gets nuked (likely NYC or DC) within a few years. 

The vestiges of the cult (it splintered into numerous factions) cite the prediction/prophetic interpretation of scripture back to the 60s and I don't know I have the motivation to reread through those writings. However, with the world events taking a turn as they have, it just brings a resurgence of worry that I had when I was young. I've always said that the only thing that could turn me back to faith was incontrovertible evidence of specific fulfillment of  prophecy. If those things start clicking into place, I question how much resolve I'd have not to go running back to what has been proven time and again to be a special sort of harmful authoritarian, bigoted beliefs. At the core of the issue, I think I'm most worried that I feel an emotional pull to revert to an objectively horrible belief system if what they said turns out to be accurate. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr I need my ego petted for a second and for people to tell me that there's no benefit in letting my former belief system affect me any longer. That or a referral to a good psychologist trained in deprogramming. I don't have a physical community to go to, as family still is with the cult and most social contacts are fundamentalist baptist and probably more likely to side with the prophetic interpretation than not."|sadporcupines|False|https://redd.it/ekxszp|2|0.67|0|12|1|atheism
el0sdq|2020-01-06 21:38:10|On 'reining in' Islam.|"I live in the European Union and as I have written many times before, Christianity is a dying religion in Europe. One of the reasons is that through universal education we have come to prefer reason over superstition. 

One other reason is that Europeans are just not having enough children. It is common for couples to have no children at all or else to postpone it till very late and then problems start to appear. 

But throughout the years we have been accepting refugees from Muslim countries. They have no such restrictions on childbearing and the Muslim population in Europe is exploding. Some decades ago our government allowed the building of the first Mosque, under the condition that there would be no shouting Mullah every few hours. Since then Mosques have been springing up all over the place. Our government knew what was going on in the ' official' Mosque and the Imam in charge was 'moderate' by Muslim standards. But many of the other Mosques are 'clandestine' and very few of us have any idea of what is being taught in them. 

I really admire, but at the same time feel sorry for French people, who have been subjected to so much Muslim terrorism and still continue to protect the 'freedom' of religious choice.

I don't give a damn if I am called an ' Islamophobe' (the term is wrongly used, anyway) but they keep pushing the envelope in my country. They do things which are barely legal as if to test how far the police will go. For example they had taken to gathering in their hundreds in very popular places, for Friday prayers. Our laws state that any large assembly of people needs prior police permission (this is mostly for practical purposes such as traffic diversions etc.), but the police seemed afraid to take any action, lest they be labeled as ' racists' (which is ridiculous, because many of the Moslems are Caucasians just like us).  I is sad that it had to be some far right protestors who attempted to ' disrupt' these gatherings by walking their dogs (Dogs are considered dirty by many Muslims) and feasting on ham sandwiches and beer."|zogins|False|https://redd.it/el0sdq|0|0.5|0|27|1|atheism

>Now this sounds fine until you think about what they are doing here. What's involved in not using ""anti-LGBT language""? Does this mean a student can't say homosexuality is a sin? Or that it's against his/her own personal ethics? It's highly likely that kind of language would be offensive to GLSEN, in which case this is a group that supports discrimination based on religion or denying free speech -- not to mention, they are clueless about the reality of homosexuality and gender confusion and their harmful impact on teens. 

What reality? The ones you lie about?

>In schools where kids are allowed to distribute these pledge cards and get people to sign their list, you may see T-shirts and posters as well, but it's not appropriate for schools to allow this, since it's again, a back-door way to get people to give approval to known high risk, immoral behavior. And since no child is born homosexual or in the wrong sex body, no responsible organization or school should be selling ""gay"" behavior to kids in the first place.

Ok, homosexuality is an attraction. What you are thinking of is gender noncomformity: https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/gnc-teens-risk-bullying-press-release/

Second please explain all the biological factors in being gay: overthebrainbow.com/blog/2017/1/7/wired-this-way-sexual-orientation-and-gender-in-the-brain

Finally ther is a link between heterosexism/minority stress and LGBT health disparitities. These same disparities are frequently cited by heterosexists to demonstrate that the ""homosexual lifestyle"" is risky, unhealthy or dangerous. Ironically, given that heterosexism itself causes these disparities, rather than homosexuality, such criticisms are not only flawed but additionally, hypocritical and counter-productive.
http://homoresponse.blogspot.com/2011/06/mental-health-and-substance-abuse.html

So saying you disapprove because homosexuality is harmful is ass-backwards

>GLSEN pairs up approval of homosexuality and gender confusion with preventing bullying. Will some kids be manipulated into signing this, thinking they are being compassionate and that there's no other possible solution? Of course they will. And GLSEN has stated one of the goals -- to identify those who are, as they put it, ""anti-gay."" If you don't go along with the way GLSEN has inaccurately defined the situation with their erroneous solutions, you are the same as a bully, a mean, heartless person. GLSEN is using peer pressure to indoctrinate the entire school community (if they can get away with this) into embracing homosexuality and gender confusion. It's another of their attempted re-education programs, enlisting straight ""allies."" But such allies are no friends to their homosexually attracted peers if they go along with this. 

They look to identify harassers... like the quote you link too says:
>""I believe schools should be safe, supportive places for all students, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. THIS IS WHY I HAVE PLEDGED TO: Not use anti-LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) language or slurs; Intervene, if I safely can, in situations where students are being harassed. Support efforts to make this, and every, school safe for all students.""

>And what about Christian kids, and others who have faith objections to homosexual behavior? There's no room for their beliefs here, no tolerance, no diversity. 

This argument is total, unmitigated bullshit. Here's why: This assumes that totally uncritical tolerance is desirable. There's a distinction between being tolerant and blind moral relativism, and it is perfectly reasonable to say that it is not desirable to be perfectly tolerant of every single thing. Extremism rarely bodes well for anybody.

ekn341|2020-01-06 02:08:59|Christianity is a nightmare|"I wish I could ""come out"" to my hyper religious mother as a athiest. Going to church makes me feel miserable, sick, and isolated. I've endured years of righteous abuse because of the ideas my mother and her religion teach. I grew up hating myself because I was bi, wanting to kill myself because I was trans, hiding that I was sexually assaulted because my mom would call me a liar and a slut, and growing up neglected and scared to speak because ""children are to be seen and not heard"". 

I am almost 18 and my parents still insist on controlling every part of my life, but they ignore the things I say and the things I need. Whenever I ask for help she tells me to ""Pray to god and donate to the church"" instead of giving me actual parental advice. When I finally told her I was self harming she said ""The devil has his hold on you"" and then barely did anything until my dad got me a therapist. All she cares about is herself and looking good in front of the church. She embodies everything I hate about modern Christianity. She's judgmental, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic, uncaring, unwilling to listen to reason, and she's hyper controlling of everything I do. She is obsessed with her children remaining virgins until marrige to the point when even when she isn't there my partner and I have to be constantly watched by an adult. When we disagree with her she screams that children must always obey their parents because it is written in the bible and that we owe her because she's ""nice"" to us. Every part of her fake love makes me sick. 

I wish I could scream in her face that her god isn't real. It's all a fairytale. But I know if I did that she would probably beat me or take away everything I love so I stay silent. 

Christianity is a violent, cruel religion that drives people to unhealthy lengths. The day I turn 18 is the day I'm finally free from this nightmare household.

So anyways after class I'm walking around campus and since it's the first day back theres alot of people asking if you wanna vote for shit and if you want to join clubs.

So out of nowhere this guy asks me if I want to join his club but at first I didnt hear what he said so I asked him to repeat what he said.

So now is the What the Fuck moment, he asks me if I believe in god and the bible and if i wanted to join his club. I walked away and noped the fuck out of there lmao. Then after that I thought of alot of different things I could've said to him like I'm sure people at the science building would love to join your club 🤣🤣🤣But I dont really like starting shit with strangers so I didnt risk doing it. Another thing that was strange was that he was black (not being racist here, just thought it was strange that he liked the bible so much  because it has so much slavery and racist shit in it). And he probably saw me a heterosexual white male, and thought, ""oh, hes probably a Christian"" you know, because most of the Christian base is heterosexual white men. That's just my guess tho lol.

So then after that I watched him talk to other people about his club and I cringed so hard inside just watching. 

So here's a question, should I start my own atheist club on campus or should I not even bother? I really hate religion and rather not talk about it at all even with atheists. But then again if I start this club I could make some new friends that think the same way I do. But I have social anxiety so I'd be nervous the entire time.

I just realized that what they really mean (but don’t realize themselves) is this: “our belief system is so broad and open to interpretation that your imagination in relation to gods existence is bigger than any doubt”.

In that way, they are actually right. Anyone with a big enough desire to keep believing will be able to hold their belief in god and the Bible no matter what new discoveries in Science or anything else may come.

India is well known for its heritage and culture and the sages who claim to have magical powers but I've been against them and the heritage since then.

(In Indian politics, religion plays a very important role. Especially after the new formed government). During these discussions people who talk freely about other religions, get offended when I put something forward against Hinduism.
   
Then they again hit me back with the ""Hinduism isn't a religion, it's a way of life"". Then they talk about how Yoga, Astrology and all of our traditional values have scientific bases and have been proved by international scientists. They then advice me on how our way of life and our culture has been based on scientific principles and is superior than the other ones. They even chant Vedic proofs of how many of the modern technologies such as the airplane, surgery etc were present in the ""Gurukula times"". Whatever rational point I put up against them about how we oppressed woman etc. They say that ""Actually the Vedas never preached about casteism, sexism etc."" These fake atheists are around everywhere and only concentrate on are putting down the other religions.

I have been irreligious my entire life.  My parents have always been very open and “new agey.”  3 years ago, something quite unexpected happened; I fell in love with a Pentecostal girl. She’s a proper one, too.  For her, God is as certain as Sunrise. She thinks i’m naive and I think she is delusional.  Yet through all this we love each other and are expecting in may for the first time. 

Whenever I'm going through emotional turmoil or have a tough decision to make, she'll say, ""I'll pray for you."" This is still infuriating.  Beyond little things like that it has never been an issue that much.  All the debate makes for some pretty intense angry sex.  The only thing i’m wondering about now is raising the Child. We got pregnant a little sooner than we thought we would.  I figured it was fine since that’s what we had planned on anyway.

With her parents visiting, we have
all talked quite a bit.  She is saying our soon to be born daughter will have to be baptized. Her parents have already opened a fund to send her through religious high school.  I knew she and her family were strongly religious but I didn’t realize how hardcore this sort of thing is when it comes to children I suppose.  What should I do? Before some kid says abort, or break up, she’s wasn’t gonna have one and it’s way too late.  Plus other than this we really are incredibly compatible and wanted to have children in a few years anyway.

The issue is really with raising the child.  I’m not really comfortable sending our daughter to a religious school where she will be indoctrinated, maybe even abused.  I’m not comfortable getting her into that sort of thing before she can at least have some choice or some say herself.  How have others here tackled situations like this?  Any advice?

Why are religious people so persistent on this. I straight up heard one of them said that we can’t be moral at all. Of course this is easily debunked by the fact that we’re not all running around murdering people, but also by some logic. 

My argument comes from the stuff I’ve heard christians say, specifically one thing I’ll never forget, a tweet or quote or something like that of someone saying: “I would never rape, it goes against god”. No? The reason should be that your moral compass doesn’t allow you to, not that god doesn’t. Your own common sense should forbid you from doing such a thing. 

What that sentence implies (at least from my perspective) is that if god was taken from the equation, you would go all oogolo-boogolo and stick a knife in my chest. Many of us atheists came from religion, so we know you can stop believing. If god is the only  thing holding you back, then frankly, I’m scared of you. 

We are not less moral. I would argue that we are more moral because we don’t believe that we will get some prize in the afterlife for being good. We also don’t believe we will get punished outside of the law. There are no supernatural forces holding us back, just our own morality.

ekmus5|2020-01-06 01:50:45|Jehovah's witness (JW) just came to the door and I struggled to debate him.|"So a few weeks back my land load was fixing a leaking water pipe in the front yard and was approached by a JW while he was working. My land load said he didn't say anything about God but did roll his sleeves up and helped him dig for an hour or so.
Come today and the same JW came to the door. We had a chat about the leaking pipe and how we managed to find the leak and fix it. 
While he was standing there I could see the leaflet in his bag and knew he would start the God talk. I got a little nervous (I'm not good with confrontation with strangers).
He asked if I'm religious and replied with no. He then asked why? I replied with "" there is no evidence that convinced me about God and I've been that way since I was a teenager. He started talking about evolution and intelligent design and about a scientists (can remember his name) that disproved evolution but gets covered by science.
He then talked about the bomb beetle that keeps 2 chemicals a part (that would explode when mixed) until it needs it and that science can't do what this Beetle can do (never heard of it before). He said it must be intelligent design. My response was that Beetles that couldn't keep the chemicals apart would of died and the ones that survived would pass the ability along to their off spring.
He gave me a confused look.
We chatted a bit longer about how people just want to help others e.g.. the Bush fires in NSW and VIC (Australia). I agreed with what he said and said it's human nature to help.
We said our goodbyes and he left.

What I'm pissed off with myself about is, I know the rebuttal to everything he said but just couldn't bring myself to say it to his face. Don't know if I was scared of getting angry or what.

(Long intro, but necessary)"|"My second pregnancy went into a tailspin at week 31. My blood pressure had gone through the roof and I was losing consciousness every few minutes. I saw flashing lights, lost time, couldn't retain information, and eventually lost my sight all within 12 hours. 

The doctors said that I had skipped preeclampsia and gone totally eclampsic and they needed to deliver as soon as they gave me the steroid shots to jumpstart my unborn daughter's lungs. I delivered via emergency c-section just as the pregnancy rolled over to 32 weeks. She was just over 3 pounds, but overall healthy. We stayed in NICU for a month before they let us leave. 

We had been released but had a long road of recovery ahead of us. My vision was back but had holes and discoloration. I developed a blood clot in my ilio-femoral artery and three more in my lungs. My daughter was struggling to gain weight due to reflux. 

During this time my mother was helping me manage things like laundry and errand running. And it was during one of these afternoons where the subject of religion reared its ugly head. 

Mom: ""I just dont understand how you dont believe in God after all that you've been through.""

Me: ""What do you mean?""

Mom: ""You had a real chance of dying, but you were saved. You and (daughter) both! How can you not see Gods work in that?""

(I'm floored y'all. I was shaking I was so angry. )

Me: ""You mean the same god who put us through all that in the first place?""

Mom: ""Well maybe it was a wakeup call for you. Maybe it was a trial to show you that you shouldn't have turned your back on God.""

Me (yelling now): ""And what about (daughter)? Was it a trial for her too? Being prodded, poked, stuck, tubed, and wired for a month?

ejxw30|2020-01-04 15:24:51|Today I told a Muslim neighbour that I don't believe in Allah, and I said this without any fear of social and legal repercussions. It is the best feeling in the world and I just felt like sharing.|"I grew up in a Muslim country, went to a Muslim school, and was sorrounded by Muslims pretty much 24/7. As far as I can remember, I was always an atheist. The idea of God never made sense to me and the more I was taught about Islam the more skeptical I grew of it. We muslims are taught throughout childhood not to question too much (I'm sure this is true for all religions) about the history of our religion, and to just accept what the scholars are telling us. Yeah fuck that. 

Anyway, I made sure not to question *too* much when I was a kid, because mob justice is pretty common in my country. Apart from that, you can't just admit to your family and friends that you're an atheist. Islam is part of our culture, so by announcing apostasy, you are pretty much betraying your culture. They almost see it as treason. So I just accepted all the bullshit that was propogated around me. I never even questioned my dad. Wake up for morning prayer? Sure, anything for Allah. Fast during Ramadan? Of course, anything for Allah. Like a sheep, I followed the shepherd. No one in my social circle knew that I was an atheist, not even my best friends. I did my best to follow the shepherd like everyone else did, because doing so otherwise just wasn't worth it.

A few years ago I moved to a western country for university. However, I stayed with my relatives who are also Muslims. I did this to save money. My relatives were nice, and I thought since I've been pretending to be Muslim all my life, what's a few more years going to do? So again, like a sheep I followed the shepherd. Pray, fast, and follow my charlatan prophet. I graduated, and now have a decent job to afford my own place.

At present most of my friends are non-Muslims, but I was always weary of announcing my apostasy whenever I met a Muslim. I had this lingering fear, leftover from my childhood, that I would be 'outed' and shunned by society. I was still pretending to be a Muslim wherever my parents called. 

""Did you pray today?"" 

""Yes of course.""

For no reason at all, if I met a Muslim, and he invited me to prayer, I would accept. But why was I doing that? I'm living in a secular country, there's no shepherd here. Fuck the shephard, fuck Islam!

The only place I was truly comfortable being myself was online. This account I'm posting from is a shitposting account (you can probably tell by the name). I couldn't rant or debate theology in real life. I was too afraid of the repercussions. What if my family finds out? I didn't want to be a disappointment. So I just stuck to online shenanigans.

Well, that is until today. There is only one other Muslim who lives in the same apartment building I live in. We're not friends, more like acquaintances. We say salam and ask about each other's days, but nothing past that. However, today he told me about an Islamic workshop he was going to and asked if I wanted to come. My response was this: ""I don't believe in Islam, I only say salam to you as a courtesy"". It's such a mundane and expected thing to say, but fucking hell my heart was racing when I said it. I almost regretted it! I said it calmly, but make no mistake, if that Muslim guy could read my mind, this is what he would be hearing: ""Fuck your Islamic workshop! Fuck your quran, fuck your prophet, fuck your Allah, fuck your dogma, and FUCK YOU!!!""

He's a nice guy, never gave me any trouble. So I politely declined his offer. He simply replied ""oh I didn't know that. Sorry for asking.""  Holy fuck, it was so simple all along! I'm not living in a Muslim country anymore, I don't need to be afraid of society or the government for my beliefs. Fuck Islam! I am planning to tell my parents about my apostasy soon. I love them, but there is no way I'm living this double life forever. It was eating away at my conscience for so long and I just kept ignoring it. I'm tellin' the world that I'm an atheist baby, and ain't nobody stoppin' me.

Sorry if this story wasn't interesting. I didn't go through abuse or anything like a lot of exmuslims go through. But I still wanted to share because I am feeling so happy today. Talked to my coworker who is an ex-christian and she was really proud of me. I finally have the courage to be myself and not let society dictate who I should pretend to be. 

One last thing, FUCK ISLAM.

\~The Bible/Quran said it's true so it's true! Very effective since all you have to do is just spiral down and keep repeating, 'but it's true!'

\~Look at the trees!!! I'm too awed and I need answers so god did it!

\~We need a purpose, I need someone to tell me what to do, otherwise I'll feel lost and don't know what to do with myself, therefore, GOD! Sarcasm aside, it's an assumption that requires demonstration that we 'NEED' a 'purpose'. (This can be the same with morality, how we supposedly need someone else to tell us something for something...

\~The universe can't possibly create itself therefore GOD. (I mean, why not though? We don't know either way)

\~Intelligence needs a prior intelligence to exist. (Eh, that's like saying a mountain needs another mountain to exist. Mountains exist because of tectonic plates, not necessarily 'other mountains'. Or a computer or pen or bread or whatever needs another computer or bread etc to exist. Clearly the first computer etc existed before any others were made so... I mean, humans aren't bread, yet we make bread)

\~Prophecies coming true. (This one is actually ok, I can see why people find this 'believable' but still not good. I can tell a group of five year olds who don't know how to read or watch tv and tell them the weather forecast and I could be right most of the time and if I told them 'god told me' sure they might believe me but there's another possible explanation.)

ek393s|2020-01-04 22:01:49|Religion seems so ridiculous once you leave it.|"Today, I finally declare myself a closeted atheist. I've been dipping in and out of religion for about a year, because my indoctrination as a child was very strong and I honestly really wanted to believe it. This is what my parents have dedicated their whole lives to, what my cousins and some of my friends since I was toddler believe in, and I by leaving it I was getting rid of a connection I had with them that only existed through religion. I'm also a female ex-muslim, which means I'm going to have to stop wearing a hijab soon and that's going to be difficult to explain to everyone. It's not that I like wearing it either, or that my family forced it on me (I chose to start when I was a tiny 9-year-old), but because I know that the muslim community I live in in Canada will surely mass-gossip about it and make me feel extremely uncomfortable about this choice.

But man, now that I've finally put my whole self on the other side, it just seems so absurd that for my 17 years of life, I wholeheartedly believed that Muhammad rode on a flying horse, or that there was a genuine reason why a woman's testimony was worth half a man's. I believed that there was justification for why a husband could hit his wife, or that their sexual urges were greater than a woman's and so he could have multiple wives (without even the consent of his first!). I used to love the Noah's Arc story when I was younger about how every land animal we have today is because Noah chose to save a male and female version of it; every bed bug, lice, and other pests that serve no other purpose in our ecosystems were *all* saved because of him. Now I've realized that these were all just stories, fairy tails that definitely kept a child version of me entertained. 

But the even more ridiculous thing about Islam is that majority of its followers don't even know what they believe in! Many have not even read a translated version of the quran in their language because translating it is a sin of it's own. *Everything* is a sin. And I know no matter how ""progressive"" my parents may choose to be as muslims, they will never cross over to this side. They will always sacrifice the simple beauties of life, like dance and music and even the occasional sips of alcohol, just to please something above and earn a spot in a heaven that doesn't exist. My mom will never truly express her beauty in the way she wishes because physical ""modesty"" is too important to her. My siblings will never get to understand what it's like to have a relationship with someone *outside* marriage, because you can't just marry someone you barely know.

Religion is horrible. Not just because of the violent things that are inherently found in most, and definitely all the Abrahamic religions, but because of all the things it takes away from the nice, peaceful followers of it who will never know what they're missing out in life. It is a bundle of lies that have led so many on a path in which self-sacrifice is a necessary compromise of it."|cruciod|False|https://redd.it/ek393s|1227|0.97|1|114|1|atheism

ekh3t2|2020-01-05 18:46:21|Bisexual doubting Christian. Too scared to come out. Need advice. Also a vent.|"As the title says, I consider myself agnostic, and bisexual. I guess this is me just asking for advice in regards to coming out. Here's a little bit of a backstory first about me.

&#x200B;

So I grew up in a Southern Baptist family in rural Kansas. My parents were very stereotypical hardcore Baptists (no Halloween, no Harry Potter, no Pokemon, you get the idea). I was homeschooled, but I never felt like I was sheltered since most other kids around the neighborhood were also homeschooled and also Christian. In fact, for most of my childhood I thought that was the norm. Now my dad was in the US Airforce, and we ended up moving to DC when I was 12 due to him being transferred there. The homeschooling community wasn't as big there, so they decided to put me in a public school that was in the military base we lived at.

&#x200B;

I had no idea how to interact with ""normal"" people, and this quickly ostracized me from other classmates. I suddenly had massive panic attacks, was scared to even go to school, and was scared to even speak with other people to the point I hated going out somewhere. Looking back, I feel like I developed social anxiety that would last me until high school.

&#x200B;

This social anxiety did carry into the new church I was attending, but not as much. Possibly because the Christian symbols and elements made me feel more at home. But in terms of mental health, I realize looking back that the Youth Pastors, the Pastor, and any other ""teachers"" there had no idea how to deal with someone that had mental issues. My parents also wanted to help cause they could see something was ""off"" with me, but they didn't really know how. But they did make attempts, and I appreciate that. The pastors and teachers however, did a terrible job. Just saying I need to ""push through it"" or ""man up"" or whatever. Or to ""get over it, it's just a joke"" when other kids would say horrible things about me behind me back. There was only one youth pastor who made a genuine effort to try to help me. In fact he tried to change up the whole youth ministry in the church to a more progressive stance. He was fired within a few months.

&#x200B;

Eventually, highschool rolls around and I'm still in public school. By this point I learned to ""live"" with my anxiety and just deal with it. However this lead to many things in the future such as depression, possible BPD, and body dysmorphia which I'm being examined for currently. Freshman year was alright, nothing happened. I did also discover my love for art this year, and began to make real attempts at drawing. Sophomore year, I met the guy I'd later fall in love with. We'll call him ""Derrick"" for now (not his real name). The way we met was that I was sitting on a bench during gym, and he literally just walked up and started talking to me as if we've known each other for years. You know that saying: ""Introverts don't make friends, they get adopted by extroverts.""? Well that was my adoption day. Because of him, it made the rest of my highschool the best it could be for me. We started clubs, he brought me into his circle of friends, and we continuously grew closer and closer.

&#x200B;

My first doubts began wasn't me questioning religion entirely. In fact I thought the de facto stance was that ""God exists"". I first questioned the Protestant upbringing I had, and searched around. After a while, I planted my stake in the Russian Orthodox Church. It was a small church nearby me, and it was deep in the woods. It was rather peaceful, and I enjoyed the change of scenery and relaxing chants and all that. This church was very conservative in it's ideas (the word ""Orthodox"" is in the name for a reason) but it didn't focus on that. Instead it focused mainly on charity and helping those in need. (If you were homeless and needed new clothes, food, or a shower, they'd get it for you. No questions asked). So I really enjoyed my time there.

&#x200B;

I began questioning religion in college when I met a classmate who considered herself a lesbian. We were studying together for a midterm exam, and her girlfriend came by and just talked for a bit. She introduced her to me, and she joined us for studying for a while since we had the same class as well. After a while she had to leave, and they kissed and left. What went through my head then was something like this. Keep in mind I still believed ""homosexual behavior"" is a ""sin"".

&#x200B;

""They seem cute together...what is wrong with that?""

&#x200B;

I questioned it mainly with my dad as we both looked through the Bible together. My dad was trying to explain to me the same dogma of: ""The family is sacred"" and ""Just look at how horrible Europe and the Black Community is without families"". But the research I did prior I shrugged them off. I could tell my dad was trying to give me a secular reason why it was bad for you, but he eventually boiled it down to: ""Because God said so"". This led me to looking further through the Old Testament as an adult, and seeing all the horrible things God did (Such as killing 50,000 people for just looking in a general direction in II Samuel) and think to myself: ""This isn't the loving God I was raised with."" I got more questions trying to figure out why someone like Ted Bundy could be in heaven if God's rules were true, but a lesbian couple that just wanted a quiet life couldn't be?

&#x200B;

My mom then also got concerned because she thought they didn't do a good job raising me if I'm questioning religion like this. (My dad disagreed, and encouraged me to search more even though he's firmly a Baptist) But it still hurt hearing those comments from my mom. Saying that ""I'm getting too involved in Science"" and ""I'm calling God a liar if I believe in evolution"" (for a quick context, I'm currently on my way to getting a Master's in Microbiology and trying to go to medical school). She also told me I should reconsider my friendship with my ""worldy"" friends such as Derrick if they're ""leading me away"" and stay with the church. At this point, me and Derrick had gotten close to where I fell in love with him, and he was returning feelings for me. He already came out as pansexual, and I consider myself bisexual (but I'm too scared to come out). My mom always felt like LGBT relationships were ""icky"", so it infuriated me seeing my mom talk about people who really helped me through some dark times in my life this way.

&#x200B;

I guess overall this was a vent post, and thank you for listening to this. My main question though needing advice would be this.

&#x200B;

I'm too scared to call myself an atheist/agnostic officially, since this anxiety has gotten me to the point I'm still scared of burning in hell for eternity. I'm also scared of how my family will think if they see I'm in love with another man and not a woman like they keep expecting me to be. How could I deal with them figuring these things out about me? Or explain it to them? Because I know they'll eventually find out, it's only a matter of time.

&#x200B;

Fuck hateful hipster non-denominational churches with their hidden anti-woman/anti-LGBTQ agendas.|"This is going to be a long post that I have rewritten over and over without posting. I feel that this could possibly help someone not make the mistakes I made. 


I'm a 37 year old white American male.  I was in the Catholic church from when I was born until I was 18.  I went to Catholic school for middle and high school.  I despised everything about the church: Hiding pedophile priests, judging everyone as being awful, being anti-woman and anti-gay, demonizing pro-choice, etc.  Nothing they taught made any sense and I became an atheist when I graduated high school.  I came out as bi-sexual several years later.  I had always knew I wasn't straight and had to hide it during my teenage years. 


My 20's were an awakening both sexually and with the people I associated with.  We partied hard, and I had a number of really good things and really bad things happen during this time in my life.  Most of us were fucked by the recession and I developed an addiction to Xanax to cope with the constant layoffs and shitty dead-end jobs. When I turned 30, in 2013, I had a nervous breakdown and was in and out of hospitals.  I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.  Many of my friends overdosed or moved away.  I was alone for the first time in many years. 


During this time, I had seen an advertisement online for a new nondenominational Christian church that was launching near me; one that was not held in a standard church setting but in a local reception hall.  I went to their launch service and found it was mostly comprised of people my age, had a live band, and was so much different than any service I had ever been to.  It was one of the non-denominational hipster churches that have grown exponentially over the past decade.  The people seemed to be really caring, and I made a number of friends in the church.  I also was referred to AA and NA and got clean in 2014.  I've since been working my way through college and am currently in graduate school.  I am grateful to these people and organizations for helping me through this rough time.  I was also beginning to relate to some of the good things the bible had, though much of the awful shit in there I could never get behind. 


In the summer of 2015, I found (after numerous months of digging through various sources) that the church I was a member of was funded by a Baptist group and they had strict guidelines against women and LGBTQ people in terms of how they could and could not serve in the church.  I was furious and met with the pastors about this, and they confirmed that their funding was dependent on these Baptist beliefs and that the pastors all agreed with these views.


This really sucked and I left that church.  I felt hurt, misled, and angry.  I decided that I wanted to branch out and that I did not want to leave Christianity yet - the 12-step groups I was a member of were heavily based on Christian beliefs and I found numerous churches in my area that were LGBTQ affirming.  


From 2016-2019 it was one let down after another.  I would go to a LGBTQ affirming church for a few months and they would either be small and lack any type of fellowship, or super big and lacking any fellowship.  It was difficult to meet anyone my age and they didn't really do much outside of the weekly service.  I don't have or want kids, and that runs counter to most Christians.  I helped with a church launch for a year only to find it filled with ultra-conservative bigoted Trump supporters when it finally launched.  One of my friends in the LGBTQ community was at an Episcopal church, and while I appreciated their pro-LGBTQ stance, it was just Catholic church lite and I could not get behind them for the horrible things the Catholic church has done. 


The 12-step groups also just sucked after awhile.  There were sex-offenders and other creeps in many of the groups and the people running the groups didn't want to do anything about it.  There is a really eye-opening documentary about this called 13th Step - Google search it and there is a free version to watch on a site called tubi.tv .  I've never relapsed on Xanax and left 12-step groups over a year ago.  The caste system they have based solely on clean-time is disgusting - some guy can lie about having years clean and get sponsees who are brand new to the program and can be manipulated for money, sex, and other things. 


Last summer, I found another hipster non-denominational church and decided to stop in.  This was it, this was the last chance I was giving Christianity.  I was surprised to hear that they were having a topic group/small group on LGBTQ issues that was starting in a few days.  I signed up for it and it was about 25 people in one of the member's houses.  


We began the group and they explained that they were a ""B"" view church with LGBTQ issues and were Egalitarian regarding woman's issues.  What this means is that they were fully affirming of women and there were no limitations on how women could serve in the church.  While that was cool, and resolved one half of what made me leave the original church I was a member of back in 2013, their ""B"" view meant the following with LGBTQ issues:


Group ""A"" Christian churches are fully affirming of LGBTQ people.  They will do gay weddings, there is no limitations on gay people, etc.


Group ""X"" Christian churches are fully excluding of LGBTQ people.  These are churches who flat-out do not want any LGBTQ people at their church and are vocal about this, they do not hide their disdain for the gay community.


Group ""B"" Christian churches will allow LGBTQ people in, but will not allow them to serve in all capacities in the church unless they are fully celibate or are in a relationship with someone of the opposite gender.  Even if a gay or lesbian couple was married in a Christian church and totally monogamous, their marriage would not be recognized in a ""B"" church. 


I was not surprised, but I was surprised when they showed a terrible Evangelical propaganda video trying to say that LGBTQ people could go back to being straight or should remain celibate.  Looking back, I should have just left, but I stuck around and when we discussed the video I didn't hold anything back.  I told them how hurtful it was, how mean and shitty it was for straight people to constantly tell LGBTQ people that they should just stop being gay.  I was on the verge of tears, but kept it together.  I was one of only two gay people there, the other person saying they were trying to remain celibate and I told them that I loved them for who they were and that if these people cared about them, they would love them for who they are as well.


To my surprise, people listened.  One of the pastors cried and stated how sorry she was about how hurtful they were being.  I began to talk to the leadership team and, to my surprise, found out that they were fully self-supporting and were not funded by any Baptist group. They were the only non-denominational church I could find that had this distinction.  This was why they voted to be fully egalitarian and had women pastors and elders.

 
Over the next few months, we continued this dialogue in the group and I was asked to sing with their church band, something I hadn't done in years.  I developed a good number of friends and we would usually hang out weekly outside of service.  


The topic group ended in September, and sadly so did discussion on the topic.  Once again it was being pushed under the rug and some of the people I was close with in the church had no problem telling me that they did not want the church to be LGBTQ affirming.  This topic was brought up at a dinner we had at a person's house in October that was not an official church event, but had a large number of church people there as well as people in the community who were not religious.  One of the pastors was there and I asked why they were holding on to these views, why was it so important for them to continue to be anti-LGBTQ?  Why could they be egalitarian yet at the same time use the bible to support their anti-LGBTQ rhetoric when the bible is notoriously sexist against women and treats them as property?  It was a heated conversation and the pastor sent me a text later accusing me of ""trying to undermine"" the church.  I met with him and his brother (another pastor there) and I tried to get them to understand why their views were so hurtful, but it appeared we were at an impasse.


The final service I went to back in early December, the pastor was talking about lament and prying for things people were suffering with as if he were the person.  Things such as being in terrible accidents ""Why did I have to be hurt in a car accident"", being unable to have children ""Why was I born with non working ovaries"" (which is really fucked up for this dude to say as it is not a terrible thing for everyone and he could never understand this lament), and finally:


""Why was I born attracted to people of my own gender""?


That was the final straw.  I yelled out at him ""There is nothing wrong with being gay, and you don't need to pray it away"".  I left, did a writeup on their Slack Channel about their hidden LGBTQ policies and how they were trying to get people to change back to being straight, and it was awful.  A gay guy replied that he ""Struggled"" with ""Same-sex attraction"" and I replied that he should not have to struggle with this and that I love him for who he is and so should this church if they care about him.  


And that was it.  There were people replying numerous views on the issue (and to their credit they didn't delete the thread), but I logged out and was done.  I've found a cool group of people in my area who are all atheist and have gone through similar things.  I'm accepted for who I am and don't have to try to be something I'm not.


I hope that this can help someone from wasting their time with hoping that Christianity can change.  It won't.  It will always create out groups for them to hate and is a cancer on our lives.  I don't want any ""prayers"" as I know may Christians browse this subreddit in an attempt to try and ""save"" people.  If you are a Christian on here and care, then try to make a difference; stop cosigning on bigotry so that you can feel better about yourself.  Call out the bullshit in your church.  Stop letting a hateful 2000 year old book keep having power in the oppression and hated of so many people.  


Thanks for reading.

Which religious background have you had the best experiences or found to have the nastiest kinks? I hear many catholics even the more liberated ones can often be a little plain. I don’t have any first hand experience.  From my experience i’ve found it to be charismatics . Not even close really.  To start off most of them are pretty good at being feminine when they want. They are super nymphos whatever their orientation. You won’t regret being with long term.  They make great partners who are very loyal.

Let’s start this off.  They know how to give head like no other,  They have a known love of anal.  They don’t even think of it as sex before marriage which is weird. In all the shaming about the dangers of premarital relations and the obsession with preserving virginity they usually aren’t well sexually educated when young.  For this reason  most of them lost their virginity in the ass pretty young and still thought they were virgins while trying to stay pure.  A lot of them have same sex experiences early as well from being kept away from the opposite sex so the one’s who escape are pretty interested in that often.  They really know the joy of lots of non penetration quite well though they will
let you in the back door very often. They spend a lot of time in church rolling around on the floor making weird noises in church and dancing so they have good hips, great rhythm and are quite vocal.

All the shaming they go through leads to some ridiculous nymphos and many crazy kinks.  My girlfriend likes  to meet up with me for for exhibitionism and transvestite shags in bathroom stalls often at gay restrooms.  I will say,  her dressing as a male makes it easier to access public bathrooms somewhat less suspicious.  She is also a fecalphiliac and who likes to make a lot of noise in some pretty interesting roles being a professional voice actress.  In the public restrooms she will voice a Canadian play by play announcer the entire time we are doing it.

We are both pansexual and enjoy sharing with other people.  I like men as well so we like to role play Sodom from the bible with her being lot’s daughter getting raped and me being being the angel they tried to sodomize except they succeeded.

Then I thought to myself if I was given another life, what would it be like? I would ofcourse be born at random somewhere on the planet with no previous thoughts of who I am now. If I had memories in the new life of who I am now then its not a new life is it? So i concluded it must be brand new with no idea of the current me now.

But hasn't my wish been granted true already? Infact billions of times over. Hear me out.

What actually makes me who I am? its the ideas I was raised with and what I learned and experiences in life. I am just a product of my surroundings. So what is the difference between me being reborn and having a new life with no memory of who I am now, and an infant that was just born? There's no difference, if I was given another life it would be exactly the same as any other child who is born now. So by my logic if I was to relive it would equate to any other person who currently exists. 

To rephrase, if I died lets say and met God and he said you can experience life again and I said yes. I would be born in a new body with new upbringing and it would be totally separate to who I am now. So essentially I have no fear of never experiencing life again because it dosent matter If i was given the chance or not, it would be as if I was anyone else on the planet right now. So I could potentially say everyone of us is all repeats of the same thing, a human born and experiencing life.

ekgqin|2020-01-05 18:20:09|My ultra-Orthodox Jewish family won't come to my wedding|"Hi guys,

This is my first post on reddit....ever. I just feel like I need to reach out and vent/get advice. Here's the story:

I grew up ultra-Orthodox Jewish in Brooklyn NY. As soon as I developed the ability to think on my own, I realized how bullshit it was. A God that is supposedly ""good"" would never condone such blatant sexism, homophobia, racism, and human rights abuses like slavery (not to mention the utter genocide when Israelites took over Israel, supposedly) and so SO so much more (seriously do religious people comprehend the shit they read in the bible...?) God either existed but was evil, existed and created the world but had not written the bible and thus likely left no instructions on how to live, or did not exist. Other religions seemed equally cruel so those seemed unlikely to be divine either. At this point I was about 13. By the time I was 15-16 I had read enough to decide that God likely did not exist. I became an atheist in a world in which there is no separation of religion from daily life. I was living a lie to avoid being expelled from school and hid my beliefs from friends. I became depressed, self-harmed daily (it helped me deal with my overwhelming rage at this situation), and attempted suicide 3 times by the time I was 17. I survived with a bunch of scars and escaped to college when I turned 18. I vowed to never look back.

I tried to move on. I almost never visited family. I got tattoos to try to cover my scars from self-harm and suicide. I started dating a guy I met in college (non-Jewish) who was the opposite of me in nearly every way, and an atheist himself. I graduated summa cum laude and now have a good job. I am preparing to pursue a PhD. And then I started to get sentimental. Time and distance can do that to you. I would be with my partner's family and pine for my own. Even though there was so many topics off limits with my family, and I had to cover up around them (modesty is a big thing and by now I have 5 tattoos, which is, of course, not allowed), I began trying to rebuild some connections. I started to get them birthday gifts and taking them for birthday dinners, got coffee/dinner with some of them. Started making an effort to go to my many cousin's weddings. Things were still testy but getting to be OK. And then my partner of 5 years proposed 2 weeks ago.

The moment he proposed was a really happy one (though I burst out crying immediately which did alarm him), but since then it's been a lot of pain. I was optimistic that my family and I were getting closer, so instead of assuming they would never attend our wedding, I decided to ask them...one by one (except my grandparents who are too frail and I worry the news would affect their health). One by one I have been rejected, just today by my older brother with whom I was the closest. Some had some nasty words along with their rejection. Some seemed almost apologetic. My brother, specifically, tried to explain that his decision hurt him too, and he will be there for me in any other way, but not this one. I am crushed, totally devastated, and I don't know how to deal with this. I am kicking myself for daring to be optimistic, for daring to think that developing closer bonds would mean anything when it came to this ultimate test of whether they can accept me and my choices. I feel utterly rejected and unloved. I can't stop crying. Have you been in this kind of situation? Advice or words of encouragement would be much appreciated.

I never specified to them what I believe or don't believe, but I think by not showing up to church it's pretty easy to draw a conclusion. My dad is handling it pretty well I think, but I could tell my mom was really sad and trying not to cry. After they got home from service she gave me a hug and told me she loved me, and it just broke my heart because I know they believe that if I continue down this path they won't get to spend eternity with their son. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to be away from the church, but it truly does hurt to know the pain it will cause my family.

ekhxr5|2020-01-05 19:44:30|I became and grew as an atheist while being indoctrinated.|"So I got to thinking about my experience over 20 years ago, and thought I'd share it. Born and raised in LA, California. Middle Eastern Jewish family. I started Jewish school in kindergarten and had after school bible class 2/3 times a week. Family wasn't too religious. We followed pretty much all the rules, none of the extra shit the orthodox do.

Earliest I remember was when we were taught something in bible school and I had a question because what we were told didn't add up. I had to have been 8? It was the Noah's ark story. I remember getting a BS answer, but I was a kid. I didn't have the maturity to argue. I couldn't face a grown up. 

I started noticing on Saturdays, we'd go to Temple and they would ask for money. This was probably the largest temple in LA and growing bigger and bigger. They had a donation drive for trees in Israel and they collected a lot of money. Soon after, the temple bought all the condos and homes on the block, tore them down and started construction. Underground parking for multiple levels and another huge section. The place turned into a fucking fortress.

I was most angry when Yom Kippur came around. It's pretty much the biggest holiday. I found out they were charging people to get in. A fucking door charge to pray. Per person, per day. Hundreds of dollars. It's always about the money.

I was 12 and being prepared for my bar mitzvah. A boy can't become a man until he reads from the Torah. So, I start special training. Turns out, they don't teach kids to read the damn thing. They just teach you the verse in the form of a song and make you sing it to a crowd of people. I'm up on the altar, they give me the pointer that I'm supposed to use to ""follow along"" while I sing. Afterwards, I asked what the point of all of that is, if I'm not actually reading it. If god sees everything, does he not realize I'm just bullshitting? Does the crowd of hundreds think I'm actually reading this shit?

At this point in my life, I had already decided it was all bull. Religion is nonsense. I'm 15, an atheist, and start hinting to my family. That's when the fight started. I came home with a bag from Jack in the box. My mom sees it and loses her shit. ""You can't bring that into the house..."" So, we're yelling back and forth and it hit me. I look over at the dog and back at my mom. ""So, the fucking dog can have whatever slop garbage out of a can in the house, but I can't have a burger? 

That was about 21 years ago. Last year, my mother brought up the burger argument. She actually told me I was right. She said she knew I was right while we were fighting. Then she apologized."|dsole16|False|https://redd.it/ekhxr5|8|0.88|0|3|1|atheism

ekdu63|2020-01-05 14:44:30|Cancer Patient here with Hyper-Religious Family|"Inspired by the recent post on this sub about the loss of a friend, I was typing a comment but thought it might work better as a post. To the OP of that, I'm so sorry for your loss.

I'm a cancer patient with a hyper-religious family. Every so often I get calls from relatives I've never even met who decided that the best thing to do with their day was tell me that ""god has a plan for you"" and ""there's a reason for all this."" It's unbearable idiocy for a couple reasons: Most obviously, because it's simply...not the case; but, it also comes with a pretty problematic implication. To say that the outcome of my treatment is ""in god's hands"" lends a pretty desperate light to the whole situation by suggesting that I and the doctors/nurses who oversee and administer said treatment don't really have a hand in what's happening. And while the logical part of me of course knows that that's an obscene thing to suggest, it's not really an enjoyable thing to hear multiple times a week.

Religion is such a troubling thing as it relates to loss or hardship. To pin responsibility for a loss on a god and still somehow respect that god is ridiculous, but to pin responsibility for a recovery on a god is dangerous: I can't imagine how I'd handle my fight against this cancer if I thought my recovery was in the hands of some god and not my own. Rather than do things that help me recover, I suppose I'd sit back, pray, and wait for god to do his work? A strategy which, you know, probably wouldn't end well.

ekgadi|2020-01-05 17:48:38|Those of you who were raised religious and became atheists later on, do you feel like you gained something from the actual process of converting?|"I was raised as an atheist and this is something I've always wondered. My dad was raised Jewish and my mother was raised Christian, and they both had life experiences that led them to ultimately become atheists. My mother especially grew up skeptical of the Catholic church and described the process of losing her faith and committing to only evidence-based belief to be extremely challenging but overall enriching for her as a person.

Although my parents never ""pushed"" atheism on me, they explained their own views to me at a very young age and I was often surrounded by discussion and literature about atheism, so I ended up with similar views. I was always taught to question beliefs and form my own based on science and logic. Although I have taken the time to try and educate myself about religion, I will never have had the first-hand experience of having been religious, and I'll never know what it's like to experience that huge change that everyone describes when becoming an atheist.

I was wondering, those of you who converted later in life, do you feel like your life is better for having had the experience of becoming athiests? I know many people say their life becomes much better after they've converted, especially those who were not treated well by their community due to the community's religious beliefs, but do you feel like something was gained from the actual experience of having had to rethink your mindset?

I know this isn't necessarily an easy question to answer, especially because no one can know both the experience of having been raised atheist and having been raised religious but converting, so it might be difficult to make a comparison, but I'm curious to hear people's thoughts.

Edit: Feel like I might not have explained well. I know that being an atheist comes along with different ways of thinking, and that tends to be a major change when converting. I'm more curious as to whether the process itself of going from theist to atheist was beneficial. In other words, if you had been raised atheist, do you feel that you would have ""missed out"" on the experience of changing your beliefs in a major way? Do you feel that the actual act of having to spend time reshaping beliefs you've held since you were young was beneficial in a way that being raised as an atheist wouldn't have been?

ek7qxz|2020-01-05 04:04:15|My story of deconverssion|"I grew up in a very conservative and toxic catholic family. However, as a kid I wasn't aware of this.

When I was about 10 years old I became sort of depressed (my grandmother died around that time, not sure if that had something to do with it). Like many depressed people I was sad most of the time and I constantly thought about death. At first I was just wondering about the afterlife, but that's when I started questioning my beliefs. Some thing just didn't fit well. Not knowing anyone ""better"" at the time, I approached to my dad. He told me to just ignore those thoughts and to move along, and that sooner or later I would start feeling better. I just did what he told, but the feeling of sadness didn't go until about two years later, in when I finally achieved to ignore those thoughts and stopped caring. At that moment I still considered myself a catholic, though I disagreed with their beliefs in some subject.

A couple of years later, when I was about 14, I changed into another school. It was a catholic one, like the one I had been at before. Even though there wasn't actually so much difference, I was able to meet non catholic people (mostly theist). However this made me aware that there was the possibility of having beliefs other than Catholicism. I stopped thinking myself as a catholic and started perceiving me as simply a theist, due to the now more abundant disagreements I had.

Fast forward to when I was 16. My theist beliefs were barely holding, and my disagreements with the catholic church were growing faster than ever as we started attending an new church with an ultraconservative and toxic priest. It was then when depression got me again. It was the thing I had feared the most since long ago, and it was back. I started feeling sad and lonely, and I started questioning my beliefs. Only this time was different. After some thinking I dropped my old beliefs and arrived to the conclusion that there is no god.

At first it didn't feel good. I continued feeling lonely and sad for a while. But eventually, I just accepted I had become an atheism. And I've never been depressed since then.

I am a closet atheist and have been so for around three years, and while I have told my very orthodox family that I am a ""non-religious person"" and stopped going to church with them long ago, revealing myself as the atheist that I am will have me instantly expelled from the family tree. Of course I have not done that yet since I still depend financially on them, but things are becoming increasingly tense over time and I fear the day they will confront me and start asking me heavy questions. I am a grown man, but in their immeasurable ignorance they think I am some sort of ""late-teens anti-christian rebel"". Knowing how my family is, they will surely use the Bible to try to ""refute and correct my wrongness"".

The question is, if they use the Bible to try to prove me wrong, what verses from it can I use to ""return fire with their own weapon""? I have seen posts with people pointing out some texts from the old testament saying things with little to no effect on a christian's view of their own book (like the one saying that they should not wear clothing of two different fabrics and stuff like that), but what are some controversial and contradictory verses I can use to make a christian think about if the book they are cementing their lives around is correct, logic or even benevolent?

I had an interesting thought today, and I searched old threads to see if this had been discussed here before, but I couldn’t find anything that completely matched what I was looking for: Is the creation of society dependent upon religion (at least in the beginning stages of a society)? Also, can religion be (indirectly) conducive to the advancement of society?

I realize that the knee jerk reaction to my second question is a hard *no,* but if one were to view religion in the context of human history as a whole (humans engaged in religious wars —> human understanding of science, math, and technology was furthered to win these wars —> society eventually adopted these innovations to help improve the quality of life, and so on and so on until present day), is it fair to say that in a round-about way, religion helps advance society?

ekb1fs|2020-01-05 09:47:07|Worried I'm becoming an extremist ... but I really hate clergy|"**TL;DR:** I *strongly* believe that the institution of organized religion (EVERY organized religion) exists first and foremost as a tool to rape children while living fat and happy off the provided labor of others. Too often the excuse is made that a few bad clergy soil the whole religion, but no, *I believe the ""sinful/wicked"" abuses of these leaders are the original primary purpose of any religion's existence*. And I worry that thinking this way is or could turn me to extremism, although I am very leery asking this particular community for advice on such a thing ... I just don't know where else to turn. Thread below:

Emphasis on ""clergy"" as in ""formal leaders within established religion."" ANY religion. Just off the top of my head, news stories I've been especially steamed about include:

* Genocide of the Rohingya people by Buddhists and the systemic torture, rape and murder of families and communities by locals and the government in Myanmar (AND Facebook looking the other way when extremist content was spread on their platform to help fan the flames of misinformation and ethnic hatred).
* Almost anything relating to the governments of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, or the U.A.E. and their dictator heads of state/royalty filth who lord over their people with near absolute power and use religion to enforce their fabricated ""divine right"" or whatever to control over millions of people's lives.
* The rise of Hindu nationalism and Modi, despite having a very comfortable legislative majority, continues to promote policies that oppress women and butcher the lives of people in Kashmir just as a way to rile up his political base in the, ""Look, I'm attacking non-Hindus!"" way.
* The Polish film ""[Tell No One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrUvQ3W3nV4&list=PLezyfJhjGrV3q4jqzb33KjUboU6ZyZelI).""
* A local story involving a big local hospital backed by the Catholic Church that for decades provided its employees big fat pensions when they retired ... but the funding abruptly ran out about a year ago and everyone's pensions were severely reduced or cut off completely. And then the news broke that the hospital and **the Church knew the money would run out a decade ago and they warned nobody for years**! They fucked over the retirements and financial stability of over a thousand people in upstate New York who had the audacity to put their trust in a Catholic-backed hospital.

I could go on and on and on, but I'm finding these and other news stories (from very mainstream news outlets, mind you: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Seattle Times, The Los Angeles Times, NBC, CBS, Reuters, etc. I'm NOT one of those worthless shitfucks who for clues about QAnon on 4Chan and let Alex Jones' angry voice scare them to sleep at night) are making me turn ever harder against the institution of organized religion.

They all seem to be organized like cults! Sure, worship is directed less to human leaders and more often at imaginary beings or even ideas, but they almost all seem to be run by extremely authoritarian power structures that are devoid of democracy or checks and balances on power; oversight on conduct (financial, interpersonal, sexual, administrative, technical, etc.) is often delegated to the imaginary being at the heart of the religion.

...now, all that said, I worry that thinking this way is making me become too extreme. Such sweeping generalizations about whole peoples are not too dissimilar from the words I hear White Terrorists and Islamic Terrorists spout with their holier-than-thou convictions that XYZ group needs to be exterminated. And too many atheists rub me as being smug jerks who simply enjoy pissing other people off (probably part of the reason I identify as agnostic) but perhaps I'm overgeneralizing them as well?

Sometimes I have violent thoughts about all this (none that I act upon) probably only because of some desperate need to feel powerful in a world where I feel so powerless with these institutions running amock with all the unearned legitimacy of the fucking Royal Family. And more often I wonder ... are these thoughts I think the thoughts of an extremist? For I have no knowledge of any metrics by which to measure extremism in myself.

------ 

In italian we have a specific swear word that is basically the word pig followed by a religious name

-----

I decided to just try to avoid naming god while with him (which is not easy for italian people)

then after a few minutes the guy , out of the same stress from losing the game, yells out the same word but naming zeus. 
I ask him ""why is zeus ok and god not"" 

and with the most serious face of the world he goes ""Because zeus isnt real""

But he started displaying the doubt he was accumulating trough 3 years of seminary. He said he didn't believe in prayer anymore, because he realized that when he prayed it was actually him that was doing all the work. He told me about when he went to make a test to get his driver's license and a girl by his side told him she took a bath with crystals to make her less nervous, and he compared it to him praying before that same test. He told me he listened to his colleagues talking shit about evolution, and even though he doesn't believe in it (mostly because of indoctrination) he knew that they were attacking a strawman. He told me how he was sick and tired of preaching about stuff he didn't really believe. He said he felt like the only use for religion is to give poor people hope and community, and right now he just believes because he feels like ""it doesn't change his life much, it's easier that way"". Throughout our talk I realized he was feeling a lot like I felt when I was beginning to leave church, like nothing made sense. He perceived the church's aversion to doubt. Perceived how we were indoctrinated, how we had no choice on what we believed. We are both pastor's sons, so we know well how it is to be indoctrinated. He said it felt like a veil was covering his eyes, and he was finally seeing things clearly.

The problem for him is that he is deep into his theology course, but he said he's determined to leave it. His girlfriend is active in the church and is pretty much against any doubt one may have about doctrine. I mean, he told me that one day he told her he didn't believe angels actually appear to people and she threw a fit because of that. So it's pretty much guaranteed that she'll break up with him once she finds out about his unbelief.

To be true I tried to remain neutral, but it made me kinda happy to see one of my best friends coming to these conclusions on his own, just like me. I live in a fairly religious place, so to have a friend like him to actually understand my point of view feels really nice. I talked to him about my journey, how I became aware of evolution, then of a little bit of philosophy, and my problems with bible contradictions and immoralities. I sent him some resources on evolution (because he said it didn't make sense to him), and some clips of ""the atheist experience"" and other atheist channels. And of course I told him that the way to the truth is his to thread through. I'm excited to see where his road goes."|MrYondaime|False|https://redd.it/ek5ypy|28|0.93|0|9|1|atheism

ekpxsy|2020-01-06 06:12:40|Why Do You Believe Australia Exists?|"Hello,

Heads up. I am an Atheist. A theist asked me a question recently that kinda got me. I have 2 responses to this question now, but I hadn't thought of it at the time. One response is weak, and the other is strong. I will post my weak response below and then my stronger response later. I, however, want to see what you guys would say in response to this theist. Mainly, I want to see if someone can arrive at a logical refutation that isn't contrived.

Another pre-note, if you've been to Australia, this specific argument won't work, but someone could ask you something else like, ""How do you know the Vanuatu Islands exist or how do you know that Cambodia exists?""

Let me unload the question to show it's strengths. The Theist says this, ""Wouldn't logic say that you need evidence that something exists? I believe in God illogically, then. But why do you believe in Australia?"" My response, ""Well, you see, we have overwhelming evidence that Australia exists, but very little solid evidence about whether God exists."" Then, the theist lashes back with, ""But you don't know that for sure, do you? Have you been there? Did you actually absorb it with the senses? How do you know it's not a conspiracy? How do you know it is not one big lie? Because you lack this uncertainty, why don't you treat Australia's existence agnostically?""

At this point, you could go into Solipsism, but I assume that you would probably only confuse the theist at this point... so I genuinely don't think explaining Solipsism and then explaining why we don't act on Solipsism would actually be that effective. 

Anyone have a refutation to this theist's argument? I do. I have two, but one of them is weak and completely based on logic. 

The weaker argument is purely logical. I would say to the theist, ""You are submitting to the logical fallacy of an appeal to hypocrisy. Just because I believe in something that I am sure doesn't exist doesn't mean that your position is, thus, correct. My belief in Australia could be wrong, and your belief in God could also be wrong. Thus, your suggestion has no logical bearing on the argument at hand."" This, of course, is a much weaker argument, and the Theist may unknowingly wander into Solipsism arguments in response (""OH WE DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THINGS WITH CERTAINTY, THOUGH, BUT WE STILL BELIEVE IN THEM, SO, UHHHHHHHH, WHY DON'T WE JUST PICK WHAT WE BELIEVE, MAN?""). I would be hesitant because you'd open an annoying can of worms.

As for what I think is the stronger argument (though possibly a bit contrived), I'll post it tomorrow in a comment and you can let me know if it is strong or weak. I am open to stronger arguments than mine.

Let me know your thoughts. Without any further ado, please argue against my mythical theist which you have no proof exists."|makeit234|False|https://redd.it/ekpxsy|0|0.15|0|26|1|atheism

ekapaz|2020-01-05 09:06:34|How I became an Atheist.|"When I was little, I always sort of believed in god. I never went to church, which is probably why I became an atheist. I feel like maybe not being there every week sort of showed me the ridiculousness of it all. I don't hate religious people, and I remain friends with them, but religion is pretty goofy to me. Anyway, let's move on to my story.

I always used to believe in god in some sort of way. I would pray to him sometimes, which I kind of am disgusted by the fact that I did that, but who cares. I would be afraid of hell and pray to god for good things to happen. But since I never went to church, I never had a full understanding of the subject. Like a student in a class with no teacher.

Eventually, when I was around 9 years old or so, I learned... shocker, >!Santa was not real!!< Crazy right? That basically made me think. ""Huh. If Santa wasn't real, and he was just made up to make people good, then why is god real?"" That's essentially how it happened. I mean, I'm pretty insightful, and I had already been pretty skeptical, but that's what blew it for me. After that, I threw away all religious ties. Everything that had been told to me made no sense. It seemed like people were just being brainwashed to believe what they heard.

I feel like I was almost unshackled by religion. like It was holding me down before. And I'm not afraid to talk about it online, but In real life, I'm pretty hesitant to talk about it. My family isn't religious, but my community is very religious. I've been pretty nihilistic ever since, so I feel like some people might just cling to religion as a beacon of hope. I'm just ranting at this point. I have no real reason to post this, but I felt like it.

This is great! But just one problem...

I've recently become agnostic. And I put ""Catholic"" on my application because that was what I used to believe.

Mom and dad told me they're probably gonna ask me questions about my faith and how it has helped me overcome the hurdles in my life, and how it pertains to me. It is stated on the web page that we should show commitment to God. They told me that I shouldn't lie or be dishonest because that's not who we are.

I am aware that they use their religious values and commitment to faith as motivation to help those in need and they do a great job at it.

But I don't know what to say. I can't think of some justification for God's existence with all that's happening in the world. I don't know how to fake it.

4. Continuing to attend the church and beg for forgiveness for how terrible you continue to be is the only way to maintain your Christian Walk.

ejwui4|2020-01-04 13:50:35|I went to church on Christmas and need to vent about it|"I used to be a Christian until I read the entire Bible and realized it was mythology. For the past few years I've been dating a girl who isn't Christian, but her parents are. Every Christmas they pressure us into going to church, and when we can't find an excuse to get out of it, we go to make them happy. It sucks, but living in the Bible Belt I'm used to hiding my beliefs to avoid conflict. It's usually not a big deal, but this Christmas made me feel especially dirty, and I need to vent.

Problem 1: The church we went to is a church for upper middle class suburbanites. The parking lot is full of vehicles that cost more than I make in a year, and half the congregation carries guns. Everyone there has reasons for their actions that sound good on paper but contradict Jesus's teachings. 

Problem 2: The church has over $100k worth of multimedia equipment including musical instruments, lights, projectors, and speakers. They also have a paid band that plays their music, and everyone who is employed by the church is required to tithe 10% of their salary to the church. The previous leader of the band was fired for not tithing after his wife got cancer and he chose to spend that money on medical bills. The new leader of the band looked like he was having an orgasm the whole time he played because he was so cultishly crushing on Jesus. The whole time he was worshiping Jesus, all I could think was, ""(If Jesus ever actually existed) do you think he would feel honored to hear you worshiping him by playing music on $100k worth of multimedia equipment bought with money that could have been used to house and feed the poor?""

Problem 3: The sermon was about [Matthew 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+1&version=NIVhttps://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+1&version=NIV), which is simply a genealogy of Mary's husband, Joseph. It traces his bloodline back to King David, Abraham, and all the other most famous leaders of Israel. It doesn't take a Biblical scholar to understand the reason the book of Matthew begins this way is to ~~establish~~ fabricate the fact that Jesus was the rightful heir to become the king of the Jews.... despite the fact that Jesus wasn't even a descendant of Joseph because Mary was a virgin, but the Bible still lists his lineage and puts Jesus at the end of it because the authors needed to give Jesus credibility. 

Anyway, the thesis of the sermon was, ""Why did the author of Matthew begin the book with this genealogy?"" The preacher's answer was that since so many of Jesus's ancestors were murderers and liars, it proved God loves us and forgives us and wants us to be saved despite our bad history. His answer was just a bunch of made up bullshit from a Biblically ignorant con artist. And everyone ate that shit up, because of course, they've never read the Bible either and don't really care. They just want to punch their time card with God and pay to feel self righteous. 

Problem 4: The walls of the church were covered with pages of the Bible that were stapled as decorations. I don't have any reverence for the pages of the Bible, but if you believe it's the word of God, this should be sacrilegious. But nobody batted an eye. 

The whole experience was a master class in hypocrisy, delusion, exploitation, and ignorance. I still feel dirty for walking into that den of psychological failure.

I've been researching Christianity a lot recently and came upon Romans 13 and this passage has lead me down a lot of different paths. I've looked up different scholars and pastors and what they say about Romans 13, and there are a lot of opinions on it. Here are some supporting scripture as well... 1 Peter 2:13, Titus 3. Some of the reasons pastors will use is that Jesus' kingdom is not of this world, and quote other passages. They will make it sound like it doesn't say what it says, and use some excuses from other passages, but then why does it say what it says? If you look at all the translations it barely changes, simply submit to the government (powers that be) because God appointed them. Why would it have been written the way it's written if there were a bunch of ""loopholes"" a pastor can quote? America wouldn't exist without Christians going against this scripture. I'm really curious for peoples opinions on this.

Romans 13 English Standard Version (ESV)
Submission to the Authorities

13 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. 2 Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. 3 For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, 4 for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience. 6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. 7 Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed."|Working_ATM|False|https://redd.it/ekejnh|0|0.4|0|10|1|atheism

ekb8cn|2020-01-05 10:09:46|Would it be reasonable for me to want to destroy religious relics (i.e. baptism certificate) related to my upbringing?|"Bit of context - I was raised Catholic Christian by two loving parents (dad Christian, mum Anglican), but genuinely questioned religion my entire life. As a child, I would complain that I don't enjoy church, to which my mum would reply that ""you'll understand some day"". I waited for my life until I realised at 17 years old that that 'day' would never come. My family would go to church about every other weekend, and I went to Christian primary and high schools. I'm now 25, and over the past 8 or so years, have become much more self aware and understanding of my own individualism. 

My view on my previous religion, although some ethics made sense (not that religion was needed to teach these morals), I found way too many hypocrisies related to the way my community worked. I remember early days of primary school where 2-3 (non-religious) kids would be taken out to a different room to skip religion class; but it was done in a sense where they were demonised. More of my questioning relates to the way that Christianity would ""love thy neighbour"", with strange exceptions that completely counteracts that. Other things include theories involving faith, an example being Russells Celestial Teapot. So on and so forth, here I am today, someone who never fit in with my religion, and have considered myself Atheist for years now.

Coming out to my parents wasn't hard, I've never been overly pressured or controlled by it. Debate and discussion about religion/philosophy these days is relatively healthy (even if this is one of the only debate topics we usually don't come to the same conclusion about). None of us are sensitive and will often joke about hailing Satan when they go to church, or that they will pray for me.

&#x200B;

**I recently thought of the concept that I should destroy my Baptism certificate** as a sign to myself that I'm officially absolving myself from the religion I was indoctrinated into without my consent. I asked my parents for my baptism certificate, but they got VERY defensive. Dad was furious that 'I was trying to destroy part of my childhood, part of what made me who I am today' - which is offset by the fact that I grew up confused and opposed to religion, and he doesn't believe that I was questioning such things from such an early age. Mum seemed hurt 'what if I want to come back to the church' - which makes me think they're actually in denial that I may still have a glimmer of religious faith in me.

I KNOW that I'm not religious, and never will be. **I now further have the idea that I should destroy all my Christian belongings** (candles, cards, medallions, relics, certificates - there's a drawer full of the stuff from religious events, all of which means nothing to me). I've considered just giving all the items to my parents to keep the peace, but I get the idea that will result in them believing that I still want to be part of the church. I've also questioned what I'd be gaining by destroying the items - along the lines of mental relief, and sending a message to my family that I'm not involved in their religion.

**tl;dr Would it be relevant/beneficial for me to destroy these items of religious significance?** Would definitely appreciate perspectives from Atheists, ex-Christians and Christians to form an unbiased conclusion.

Edit: at this point I'm probably thinking of boxing it all up and giving it to my mum. I don't want the stuff, and never will. But doing this might bring them more joy than it brings me closure/satisfaction."|FaunKeH|False|https://redd.it/ekb8cn|2|0.67|0|19|1|atheism

I think humanity is beautiful and I truly want the best for my fellow humans, which is why it’s hard to watch them participate in religious practices when it leads to unneeded suffering/problems. I have a persistent need within myself to try to be as moral as possible. I feel like I’m morally inclined to try to help people, but it’s hard to do so when you’re viewed as the bad guy. I don’t want to harass anyone, but I feel like I’m almost giving up on someone if I just stop trying to get them to see where they’re going wrong. And of course questioning god is wrong in their eyes, so I’m the bad guy again. Would it be morally acceptable for me to basically just ignore them, or do I have an obligation to try to help?

One night we were talking about this & that and he made an offhand comment about Jews burning in hell. I reminded him that Jesus himself was Jewish and he says, “Brother, I love you, but if you call Jesus a Jew one more time, I’m going to have to fuck you up. You don’t insult God in my house.”

When I calmly told him that it’s not an insult or a conspiracy: it’s in the Bible (Jewish messiah, etc), he tells me “I don’t need to read the Bible to know Jesus wasn’t a Jew. You don’t get to talk about my god. You don’t even fucking believe.” I then had to deescalate the pending fist fight.

His brother, who was hunting with him, lay upon the hay and looked at him. When S. had finished his prayer and was turning to sleep, the brother said, 'Do you still keep up that thing?' Nothing more was said. But since that day, now more than thirty years ago, S. has never prayed again; he never takes communion, and does not go to church. All this, not because he became acquainted with convictions of his brother which he then and there adopted; not because he made any new resolution in his soul, but merely because the words spoken by his brother were like the light push of a finger against a leaning wall already about to tumble by its own weight. These words but showed him that the place wherein he supposed religion dwelt in him had long been empty, and that the sentences he uttered, the crosses and bows which he had made during his prayer, were actions with no inner sense. Having once seized their absurdity, he could no longer keep them up.""

She thinks that everything you do wrong is because of the devil and everything you do good is because of God. If I have a headache or something, instead of giving me painkillers like a rational person, she says pray. It's jarring and crazy.

Anyway, my friends were before just teasing me, like “don’t speak you’re an atheist” and stuff like that. But my friend flipped out, now kind you this is a while ago so I can’t be sure, but I kind of remember him telling me that I’d go to hell. He was also like “I work so hard all year being Christian” and I got super pissed cause he was being, well, an asshole. Then he apologized and I was like “alright fine,” later he sent me a meme making fun of atheism which was just wrong. A couple of moths later we were talking, and he was like “I’m just trying to save you.” I was just sitting there like wtf. 
Anyway I know that this was a long preamble, but I wanted to lead to this, because of shit like this and other experiences I’ve had, before I told my really Christian friend I was atheist I actually said something along the lines of “don’t think lesser of me, but I’m atheist.” I’m just pissed that we have to do shit like that, our religion/anti-religion should be just as respected.

One of the Borg brings another and complains that the second one keeps disconnecting himself from others. This is what Lore says:

""I told you to link yourself with (other Borg's name).""

""Yes you did"", borg replies with some hesitation in voice.

Now Lore starts his preaching voice: ""Look, I know you have doubts right. I understand. Of course you do. You have these new sensations, feelings. It's only natural. Thats why you must always be in connection with others, so that you can use their strength and confidence. ""

This dialogue stuck with me for so long. This is exactly how people stay religious even though they may have questions and hesitation. They keep going to church and  preachers continue to act in a patronizing way exactly like Lore does. They want you to be in connection with rest of the ""herd"" and not talk to ""others"". 

And it's also true that being part of the group (evolutionary hard mentality ) gives even the hesitant ones a feel of strength  and confidence in their illogical beliefs - a constant feedback loop between themselves.

ejx7i5|2020-01-04 14:25:17|The practice of moderate religion in its own way is just as dangerous as strict and extreme observance.|"While much attention gets paid to tabloid headlines about pastors citing the Bible as an excuse for the murder of gay people and abortion rights activists, or the hypocritical thieving by mega churches, a quiet yet equally malicious presence is maintained in moderate religion. 

As Sam Harris says, moderate religion betrays both faith and reason. I would even argue that the betrayal of faith is even more betrayal of reason. 

On a surface level, anyone who cherry picks which parts of their holy book to take as the literal word or commandment of god while ignoring other parts as “outdated” or because they don’t have a place in modern times is simply openly and proudly heralding the fallacy of the book and the concept of a holy book in its entirety. But there have been so many posts about this already and I don’t need to get into any of that again. 

Where this becomes dangerous on a societal level is the allowances made to moderate observers of religion. People who believe in their holy text and their faith but don’t outwardly do it in a way that is extreme or evangelical or evil. 

This facade of legitimacy makes the inquiry against fanatical religion taboo, since it makes someone who challenges an evangelical point of view look as though they are in effect arguing with the same tenants as held dear by a “kind hearted, moral person”. In other words, dangerous, hateful beliefs of ultra devout religious observers are afforded the same protection as their moderate counter parts because they are part of the same faith, and the moderate people who live “good, honest lives” essentially build a defense for those who angrily preach their hate. 

Moderate religion is also much easier for society writ large to tolerate, and for this reason helps to hide the fact that so much of the main texts of the monotheistic religions are themselves hateful, self-contradictory, and effectively dangerous. The scrutiny of the holy books is seen as hateful and argumentative because so many of the people who abide by them happen to be nice, decent members of society. Nevermind what’s in the book. (Slavery, incest, propagation of beliefs - such as the idea that the Earth is 6,000 years old - that contradict science and kidnap people into believing lies.)

Religious exemption for vaccinations is dangerous. Religious tolerance of violence and hate is dangerous. But because moderate practice of religion looks so decent and wholesome, these problems grow and fester, and even worse, turn the critical observer into an outcast."|OneM0rethyme|False|https://redd.it/ejx7i5|46|0.99|0|17|1|atheism

So we all sit down for dinner and my gf mom asks her mom if she wants to say grace, I start eating because I want to make it clear I’m not involved. My gf gives me a look of disapproval. 
She starts praying in general at first, but after that she got specific and starts praying for people by name going around the table to her right, I’m sitting to her left, so I have plenty of time to think, and I come to the conclusion that I’ve made it abundantly clear I’m not taking part and shouldn’t have to worry. 
I was wrong, she gets to me and asks if I work tomorrow, as she had everyone previously, to which I responded with,
“Oh, no, uuuhhh, I um, no. thank. you.” 
And I did a brushing hand gesture, like a, “go away” kinda thing, it all happened fast and I was caught off guard.
Like wtf, had I not made it clear I wasn’t involved?

So I don’t think much of it honestly, I already don’t like her gma because she’s racist, homophobic, and basically the most “OK Boomer” boomer to ever go boom boom...

Later I find out everyone thinks I was being disrespectful and this is the point of this entire fucking post!
They think because I didn’t just go with it I was being disrespectful.
No.
She was way outta line trying to include someone in her religious ritual who obviously doesn’t want to be part of it. I wish I had made it quite clear I don’t share her harmful world views right then and there, but I just stumbled through “no thank you” instead, the most respectful thing I could say in the moment.

ejxfhs|2020-01-04 14:45:27|Growing up in a toxic church made me an atheist|"This is gonna be long, sorry.

When I was 15, back in 2010, the church I grew up in got a new pastor. Our previous pastor cheated on his wife and vanished after it came to light. The previous pastor's name was Richard. Even though Richard was a scumbag for having an affair while preaching the importance of not being sexually immoral (he preached about it a lot when I was a kid), he treated me kindly. He favored me and let me be a part of the community. He'd dote on me, he'd let me show my talents to the church, including my language skills and my musical talent. My mom says that he didn't like her or my dad so he must have taken pity on me and that's why he treated me so well, for all I know, she could be right. The new pastor’s name is Rick L. Rick was appointed after the church members voted for him.

After each member voted, Rick became the official new pastor. After he preached a few times, he wanted to start being involved in youth activities. The youth group and the youth pastor, along with Rick went downstairs one Sunday, and I wanted to talk to him (I can't remember what about), so, being my cringy teenage self, I poked him. On the arm. A few times, and he looked up from his phone at me like he was disgusted that I touched him. The look in his eyes immediately made me recoil. I knew then that he wasn't going to like me.

And I was right. Every ounce of joy I had being at that church was drained away in a short time. It was small things at first. He changed up the way the Sunday school would function, separating by gender AND age, making each Sunday school class much smaller. Then he hired a new youth pastor. Mike M and his wife Stefanie M. Mike was a total fucking douchebag.

Mike almost deserves his own story, but some of the things he did while he was the youth pastor: bent down and nut punched both of my younger brothers making one of them cry, they were 13; in the church bus, he pulled over once and asked someone if they needed a ride and when the person lit up and smiled saying ""yeah, man, thanks!"" Mike said, ""I hope you find one,"" and pulled away. When I confronted Mike about hitting my brothers, he yelled in my face telling me not to talk to him that way. All I had said was, ""Why did you do that, you hurt them!""

There was some drama about a new girl named Rebecca and she said some shit about me, probably jealous that I was friends with her boyfriend or something, so any time I wanted to try to make peace with her, adults from the youth leadership would always intervene, treating me like a criminal without any reasoning to back them up.

When I turned 17, my mental health began to decline. I very quickly became depressed and very socially anxious. Not too long after, I began to cut myself and I became suicidal. It was the end of my junior year in high school, it was very sudden, and I continued to cut on and off even until now, 7 years later; though much less now.

During the summer of 2012, when I was 17, I had this friend named “Lucy.” His name is now “Luke,” but for the purpose of the story being accurate to the time, I will refer to him as Lucy.

She was about 4 years younger than me, but we both went to the same church. We were really good friends, so during one particularly free week, I asked her if she wanted to stay over. She ended up staying over for almost the entire week. We had a lot of fun, going to an arcade in a city a couple hours away, going to a water park, etc. We also were really big anime fans.

She had never seen Death Note, so I pulled it up on my phone and at night, we'd watch it together (my mom thought anime was demonic). She ended up really liking it, just as much as I did. We were weebs and decided to cosplay as a couple of the characters as best we could, being not allowed to wear makeup or pants... or cut our hair--you get the picture. Anyway, we went to the dollar store down the street from my house one day when my mom was at work and bought some notebooks, black construction paper, and glue, white markers, etc. We decided to make our own Death Notes. We never planned on writing real people's names in them or anything, though. We had a laugh about it, and just kind of kept them for show.

Lucy ended up going home at 11:18 in the morning on Friday (I don't know why I remember that time so specifically). We texted most of the day, and eventually, at around 8 or 9 pm, she texted me that she thought something was wrong. This is basically how the conversation went:

L: Can you help me?

Me: With what?

L: I feel weird

Me: What do you mean?

L: Like, I just almost kicked my brother in the head, but I wasn't the one who moved my leg

At this point, I'm thinking it was like a muscle spasm or something

Me: Maybe see a doctor?

L: No, I feel weird

Me: What can I do?

L: Do you have Bro. L (pastor)'s number?

Me: Yeah, here, it's --- --- ----

I didn't hear anything else from her that night, but about an hour later, my mom got a phone call from the pastor, and she came tearing into my room shouting about how the pastor was just at Lucy’s house and that he just cast a demon out of her and now he's on his way to our house. I, understandably, started freaking out. My mom is yelling at me that we made things called death notebooks and we were doing witchcraft and if anything happens to her (her as in, my mom) because of this there will be ""hell to pay.” I would like to mention that at this time, around 10:30 pm, my dad and brothers were all asleep in their rooms, and I'm honestly surprised they didn't wake up because of her screaming.

Eventually, Rick and Mike knocked on my front door. My mom made me answer it. As soon as I opened the door, Rick stuck his finger in my face and walked me backwards until I was sat on the corner of the couch in the living room and, still with his finger in my face, said to me, ""you will not corrupt any more of our youth"" then began to talk to my mother.

After some time, Rick and Mike asked if they could see my bedroom. I went in there, and they followed. I was a depressed teenager, it was messy. I had pink walls that had all kinds of drawings and paintings on them (my mom figured we were going to paint over them anyways, so she let me paint and draw on them). I also had a painting of ""The Last Supper"" hanging above my bed. The top part of my desk had carvings in it (I'd had it since I was 10, what do you expect?) that I had done years prior.

I had drawings I had done and was proud of, taped on my wall above my dresser, and notebooks in my half-bookshelf. Either Rick or Mike, can't remember which one, said something about being able to feel ""conflicting spirits in here."" They pointed out the rainbow I had painted on my wall (I was a cringy weeb that used to say rainbow was my favorite color), and asked me a few times if I was a lesbian. No, I'm not. I'm actually bi, but I didn't know it at the time; I thought I was straight, so it bothered me that they kept asking. They grilled me about the shit 10 year old me had carved into the top of my desk, and about the drawing I had on my wall of a guy with long hair embracing a girl with short hair (wild concept, right?), about my notebooks I was using to practice learning Japanese, questioned my bottle of antidepressants, and finally, Mike went through my phone.

I'm not gonna lie. I watched porn. I was really ashamed of it back then, so I deleted my web history every day. Unfortunately, I had forgotten to delete it that day, so the only thing in the history was porn. Mike (he was always a dick, even more than Rick), made a face and put it down saying something like, ""I can't look anymore, I'm gonna be sick."" Fuck off, Mike. They asked me things like ""do you have any sex toys?"" and ""are we going to find any sex toys if we search your closet?"" They weren't, because I didn't have any. I was still a minor at the time, could that have been sexual harassment or something?

They went through my bookshelf, my desk, everywhere you could hide something. They gathered up all of my notebooks that had any Japanese or drawings in them, they took my drawings off the walls, took any anime merch I had (which wasn't much considering my mom thought it was demonic), and told my mom she needed to paint the walls white asap.

After they left, I sat in my room, on the floor, bawling my eyes out and trying to cut through my skin with a pair of dull scissors. It was well past midnight now, and I just tried to sleep. I don't remember anything from the Saturday that followed, but I'm sure I was depressed for most of it.

Come Sunday morning, Rick was all excited and hyped up for the service, acting like he was so happy and preaching about how he had cast a demon out of someone over the weekend. He mentioned that there was a second house he went to and that that person wasn't ""as productive."" I felt like absolute shit after that sermon, like, I seriously wanted to die. After it was over, a close friend of mine (who also hated going there but was forced to) told me that in the prayer room before church (where most of the more influential people go before church to pray for the sermon), Rick had told his version of the story actually saying my name.

Things got really bad for me after that. As my depression got worse, more and more people stopped coming to say hi before church, stopped looking at me altogether, stopped being nice. People openly treated me differently, or acted like I didn't exist, and I became increasingly suicidal. I didn't know why they were treating me so poorly. Had I done something not worthy of being forgiven? Just a few months prior, Rick preached about Goliath holding a sheep by its legs and the other sheep should throw rocks at Goliath, and not the sheep being held (hopefully the symbolism isn’t lost on anyone). Why were people ""throwing rocks"" at me?

I started feeling more suicidal at church than I did anywhere else. Around this time, I got into an argument with my mother over the music I listened to (it didn't have any cuss words or anything, she just didn't like the genre) and when I played it in front of her, to spite her, she started literally beating me. Punching me with her fists and my dad had to physically pull her off of me, while she yelled incoherently.

I stayed the night at my best friend's house, and they took me to school the next morning. Because of my depression and overwhelming anxiety at this point, I had transferred to the alternative school to be in smaller classrooms. I actually had friends at this school, and one of them reported my mom and the school called CPS. I lied to the CPS worker because I knew if they took me from my parents, I'd be put in foster care for less than a year and I'd be homeless after I turned 18.

My mother later tried to justify it to me with Proverbs 23:13 ""Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.""

After I returned home a few days later, she didn't speak a word to me for a whole day before I broke and said something first. It's not necessary for this story, but my mom is extremely toxic, always has been, and has done some really fucked up things to me in the past.

When I went back to church, I was just about ready to die. Practically all the will to live had been drained from my body. I stopped caring about anything. My mom wouldn't let me see a therapist. She believed depression as well as all mental illnesses were demons and could be prayed away.

It wasn't until a couple years later, when I sat down to talk to Rick that he told me that at the time when I was 17, people were coming to him and telling him they thought I was in ""direct opposition"" to him and wanted nothing to do with me. Why hadn't he pulled me aside and asked what was going on? Why hadn't he pulled my mother aside? Why hadn't he told these people to come ask me or something? What had the done with this? Nothing. He sat back and watched my life fall apart around me.

At this time, I was beginning to recover from my self-harm addiction, and I was proud of myself for getting past what happened in my past. Well, the teacher for the older teen's girls' class was Melanie. She once said that what happened in our past didn't matter. I got upset because it very much did matter to me. Melanie told Rick that I threatened to jump over the table and strangle her. So, Rick kicked me out of the youth group.

Rick wouldn't let me do anything with the youth group anymore. I wasn't allowed to participate in the youth Wednesday night services. I left the church for a few months and came back when I was 18, with a new determination to be the best Christian I could be.

I was trying my hardest to serve god and truly be a good Christian. The way people treated me didn't change. Rick had made it so you were done with the youth group when you were 18, instead of the previous 21. Rebecca was 18 (we had made peace by then, no thanks to the church) and still going to Sunday school. I was jealous and lonely, there was no one else in the regular service my age to sit with, so I went downstairs and calmly explained to Melanie that since the age was 18 now, and Rebecca was 18, it wasn't fair that I had to be upstairs by myself. She calmly said that it wasn't the time to talk about it, so I complied and went back upstairs. My friends in there later said that Melanie's husband, Gabe, came in the room and Melanie said, ""Jessica just came in here and threw a fit."" Which of course got its way back to Rick. He didn't say anything to me though.

Eventually I was given permission to go to youth services on Wednesday nights, and I asked Melanie if I could sing on the platform, I had wanted to for years. She said, ""I'll have to pray about it."" That was the final straw. She'd have to pray about me, who was trying my best, genuinely, but she let Jacob on the platform? Everybody in the youth group knew Jacob was about the least ""godly"" as you could get. He was doing drugs, having sex, and wasn't shy about it, but they'd have to pray about me?

I left that church for good. I blame all this on Rick. Things were good before he showed up. Two years later, my only sister died. I went back to that church one last time to look for comfort. I submitted a prayer request for peace of mind (this was 6 days after my sister died). I watched as Rick read through every prayer request and then skipped over mine. That was it. I hated this man and I wanted him to pay. And he never has. I asked him, when I was 19, if he thought my sister was in hell (a member of the church came to me and told me she was in hell because she wasn’t a follower of the same denomination), and he asked me, “What church did she go to?” Which is absurd to ask in the first place, but when I told him, he pursed his lips, tilted his head back and said, “I hope it was enough.” Earlier this year he got a better gig and left our small-town church. I reached out to him on Facebook messenger, explaining everything and that he had hurt me. He never replied.

I’ve been back a handful of times, usually only when my mom asks me, which isn’t often. Though she’s been an awful mother, she’s been getting better over the last few years, and she realizes now, just how harmful and damaging that place was for me. I still believed after I left, mind you, but I wanted to find out what I believed and why, so I read the Bible cover to cover. It really confused me more than anything.

So, I began to attempt to prove the church I had grown up in, wrong. I found the verse they use to force women to wear skirts and dresses. Deuteronomy 22:5, “The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.” I found out who would have written it: Moses. What did women and men wear back in those days? Everyone wore robes? Then why would he say not to wear the same thing? What language was it originally written in? Hebrew. Let’s take it back to the original Hebrew and translate it into modern-day English. Turns out, it has NOTHING to do with what women wear. It talks about a soldier should not use a woman as a weapon of war. Why would an all-powerful, all knowing, and merciful god allow his followers to be misguided by a verse so badly translated? There’s no way I picked the only verse in the whole Bible that was that badly translated.

So, I stopped. I didn’t bother looking further into the Bible. I talked with “Mary,” she had taken Old and New Testament classes in her college and we talked about it. A lot. And she brought things up I had never thought about. It further shook my faith. Then came the debates. I’d listen to debates with preachers and atheists, such as Ken Ham vs Bill Nye, or any with Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. I found myself siding with the atheists every time.

In a last attempt to salvage my now-vanishing faith, I prayed. I asked god to prove himself, show himself to me. Nothing. That settled it. I stopped believing.

As for that church, Rick and Mike are no longer there. Mike left when I was 18, and Rick left sometime in the fall last year. They have a new pastor, one who I actually approve of. I can’t remember his name, but I had a short conversation with him a few weeks after he became the pastor. I asked him the same question I asked Rick, someone came to me and told me my sister was in hell because she wasn’t the same denomination. He replied with the answer I was looking for, “It’s not a matter of being ‘Pentecostal,’ no one can know that, that’s between her and god, I cannot say.” He’s a much humbler man, and I believe he’s doing what he believes is the right thing, because he wants to, unlike Rick, who I believe was doing it for the power.

I feel now that I am no longer weighed down by the shackles of the UPCI, of that specific church. I’ve moved passed it. My heart has healed, and this will probably be the last time I talk about it for a while, to anyone, not just strangers online.

>""Moving the goalposts"" is a British expression first popularized in the late 20th century and is obscure in America outside of use by elitist liberals such as evolutionists in debates. It is allegedly the practice of, in an argument, one person challenging the other to meet a certain set of conditions in order to prove something, and then proceeding to change those conditions after they have been met by the other person. Essentially, moving the goalposts is when an evolutionist tells you ""Show me proof of God!"", and, after being shown the Bible, telling you that ""Um...the Bible doesn't count! Show me something else!""

No...https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence_for_God%27s_existence#The_Bible

>The phrase is often used by liberals in an effort to seem ""educated"" and ""intelligent"" by using the obscure, hardly-used phrase. This is unsurprising, as rather than actually use scientific data and peer-reviewed facts to back up their globalist, Anti-American claims, evolutionists will resort to attempting to confuse the other person when backed into a corner. Luckily, the only goalpost that real Americans need is the Holy Bible.

Really? http://arizonaatheist.blogspot.com/2007/08/taking-way-of-morons-master-to-task_27.html

>The phrase's obscurity can be demonstrated with a quick Google search. ""Moving the goalposts"" has only 450,000 references on a Google search as of August 22, 2017,[1] while a Google search for ""creationism"", a mainstream scientific subject, has 4,510,000 results. This proves without a doubt that evolution is false.

Google doesn't give out results based on the truth of a subject.

>As evolutionists are incapable of explaining the wonders of God's creation, they often resort to this phrase and other types of ""logic"" when pressed by creation scientists in debates, as in ""now you're moving the goalposts"" in response to a question.

From what I've seen, CofE Christianity is simply a sort of umbrella term for community focused social groups that follow religious teachings of how to treat thy neighbour. However in the US, it appears more like a cult, which concerns me greatly. 

When I offhandedly told my mother I wasn't Christian, she said ""Yes you are, you were baptised"". This illustrates sort of how Christianity is more a lifestyle choice and less so a religion, which is exactly how it should be. Of course, she knew that I wasn't religious, but she didn't care in the slightest and we had no need to convince the other of one belief or the other because no one cares. 

In my honest opinion, being devoutly religious has more stigma to it than atheism with people I know. This is probably part of the reason why Islam appears to be disliked so much. 

I am so sorry for people who are stuck with people so enamoured by religion that they miss the point entirely, that it should be a guide to living happily, as opposed to a strict rule list, which you must enforce on others, else they will forever be burning in the pits of hell.

ejyffk|2020-01-04 16:09:09|[Positive] Growing Up Christian - asking where were the dinosaurs during SS lead to my family quitting church.|"Heyo all! So this is just a silly story about me coming from Presbyterianism (bloody mouthful) to atheism. For background, my mum’s an American Presbyterian, and my dad’s an English atheist. Most of this takes place in a tiny town about an hour north of NYC in the early 2000s, but I live in the Bible Belt now so the lessons I learned have actually helped in debates a lot.

[TLDR] well, the title really

When I was a kid, I remember my only religious schooling was from my mum. She’d bring my siblings and I to church every Sunday and then we’d go to Sunday school. It was a pretty sweet gig, you had old ladies reading you picture books, there was free sugary snacks, and you only had to memorize a few bible passages here and there (super useful now, thank you Pastor Martin for your decorum and colorful debates when I got older).

So fast forward to age 7, I was in a Sunday school class with my sister and we were getting the creation story taught to usby this crazy old lady. She was talking about the 7 days, etc., and  I was almost jumping out of my seat with excitement. Like any good kid, I was OBSESSED with dinosaurs. My mum loved museums and would take us to the American Museum of Natural History once a month. I was a tiny child, and dinosaurs were so much bigger than anything I could have imagined. I loved them so much I used to save up my weekly allowance of quarters to buy plastic dinosaur figurines. 

Well we get to the end of the creation story and there were no mention of dinosaurs. I raised my hand and when I was called on to ask a question I asked the lady where were all the dinosaurs? I knew vaguely that dinosaurs occurred before all modern life she mentioned, so I was confused how she skipped over the coolest beings to have ever walked this earth. Lady lost her shit. Apparently dinosaurs were put in the ground by Satan, and I wasn’t believing hard enough if I thought they were real which was why I was going to hell. 

So I went home crying, and after driving us back home my mum sat me down and asked me why I was upset. I explained that the SS lady told me dinosaurs didn’t exist, and I was going to hell and needed to throw away all of my dinosaur toys. In retrospect, I realize that as I was telling my mum that, she was also slowly losing her shit (not at me). To my mum’s credit, she never let her religious beliefs get infront of her motherly duties, and always encouraged questions regardless of how silly. 

The next thing I remember, she got very very quiet, told me I had done nothing wrong and that she loved me very much. When my dad got home they had a talk and then we all got loaded into the van and driven to the church. My siblings and I sat in the car with my dad (he’d play Led Zeppelin when my mum wasn’t around so it was awesome) and my mum went into the church with that same calm quiet demeanor. 

About ten minutes of bugging my dad to get ice cream quickly later she came out, face completely red and shaking, and then very calmly told us we were never going to go to have church again and she was very sorry I got yelled at with my sister like that. 

As a kid it was awesome - another free day to go outside and pick up cool rocks and sticks - but now as an adult I’m very impressed with how my mum handled the situation. She continued going to the same church every weekend, and would invite us to come if we asked, but otherwise never pressured my siblings and I to go again. When I was a becoming a teenager and had a ton of questions from being taught Christian theology but not practicing, she’d drive me to the next town over where their pastor with a PhD in theology and was very well versed in my questions. She always put logic and reason first when raising her kids, and for that I can never be more greatful. Love her to bits.

P.S. that Pastor Martin with the PhD, honestly asking him and my atheist dad questions at a young age were what helped me decide I wanted to reject religion and become an atheist. Martin’s perspective boiled down to that you should follow your convictions, and if that meant you didn’t believe in god then you shouldn’t have to go to worship. 
My dad’s point was it was more time to watch soccer, and if worshiping had the same effect as not worshiping then what’s the point."|iainfull|False|https://redd.it/ejyffk|15|0.86|0|9|1|atheism

ejprho|2020-01-04 01:58:25|With age comes wisdom. The older I get the more I realize the complete and utter nonsense behind religion.|"I thought I might try posting here because there’s really no one in my life I can talk to about this kind of stuff. I was raised in a genuinely oppressive ‘Christian’ household that was basically a cult. For a long time, I chose to believe in all the God stuff, well, because that’s what I was told to do, and I guess because it was a nice thought. When I was a little girl, I thought that if you truly believed hard enough your prayers would come true. Tragedy struck when I was 7 and my cat died and as I laid sobbing upstairs and praying to the mighty god to bring my only friend back to life, I talked myself into believing that he would. I’ll never forget running downstairs only to find that the cat was still dead. 

From then on, anytime I would pray for something that moment filled my mind. Eventually I stopped praying, realizing it was useless. It still took me a ridiculously long time to also eventually come to realize the heinousness of the Bible. It seems to be written by a bunch of racist, sexist, hateful, power hungry old men set on justifying thousands of years of crimes and creating a means of controlling people. The number of perfectly intelligent and logical people I’ve spoken to about this that still believe every word of the Bible is true because of ‘divine inspiration’ or whatever is astounding to me. The blind spot religion creates in people is just as baffling. 

I can’t say I don’t believe in anything. Honestly, I’d sooner say I believe in everything rather than nothing on the god front. Anything is possible, I suppose, if not probable. Who knows? Who could know? But if there is a god, it’s not the petty, vain god that people preach about. If one exists, I don’t think he gives a shit. I think we’re probably closer to being germs under a microscope than something significant. 

It drives me crazy to hear the people in my life talk sometimes. Yes, Linda, tell me about how you ‘witnessed’ to your niece about having sex before marriage and about how ‘grateful’ she was. I’m sure she appreciated you sticking your nose into this intimate part of her life. That makes perfect sense. It also make sense that the sex life of a young adult woman is a major concern of the all-powerful, all-knowing god. Jesus christ, your logic is worse than your haircut. I think the worst one was hearing someone say that they’ll ‘pray for me’ because I questioned whatever nonsensical thing they were convinced god was influencing in their life. It hilarious to me that they think this will help. 

I don’t know. I suppose I just wanted to rant and honestly don’t know if this even fits this sub. I’d just be nice to have someone to talk to."|NotInterestingOrFun|False|https://redd.it/ejprho|186|0.95|0|37|1|atheism

ek2mhu|2020-01-04 21:16:11|Reflecting on how Christianity has affected my life after losing my beliefs|"Sorry if this post is redundant or overly long. I'm making this post more for myself than anything else to write out how I'm feeling, but I figured you guys may find it interesting if you can spare the time to read it. 

A bit of background first. I grew up in a strong Christian household, going to church, attending youth groups, doing Bible studies, the whole 9 yards. I truly believed that the Bible was true and was confident in my beliefs. I brought this belief with me to college and joined a Bible study on campus. About a month or two ago I began questioning my beliefs and I can now say I have lost my religion.

What caused me to start looking at my beliefs objectively is actually pretty unexpected. I have always had a sliver of doubt in my religion, as most Christians would by lying if they said they didn't. Like any Christian does, I ignored these feelings and told myself it's normal to doubt myself. What made me actually stop and objectively analyze Christianity was a Classical Mythology class I was taking last semester as a literature requirement for my major. My professor told the stories and beliefs of the ancient Greeks and how people called *Aoidoi* would recount these tales from memory. I remember thinking to myself ""How could these people believe this to be true? Especially since they were recounted by humans and stories often were inconsistent with each other."" That's about when the *oh shit* moment hit me. I started looking into Christianity from an objective POV, looking back into the original of the stories and how it was spread. I also realized that most arguments in favor of Christianity (or any religion) is more or less an argument that some higher power exists. So why do I assume Christianity is correct? Why now Judaism? Why not Buddhism? In fact, why not Greek Mythology? Why does there even have to be a god? I guess that makes me more agnostic than atheist at this point. The one thing that I could answer confidently was that the odds of Christianity being absolutely true is extremely small. I went from being a strong Christian to being a non-believer in about a week. I was astonished as to how quickly this happened.

After coming to this realization, I pretty much went into an existential crisis. My roommate once said ""Religious people have such an easy view on life. Everything that happens can be explained so easily by 'God's plan' and death just isn't something to worry about."" I never quite realized how true that was. My entire life I believed that life was a mere stepping stone for something greater, but suddenly I realized that it may be all I have. I couldn't stand the idea that when I die, *that's it.* I understand that nobody knows what happens when we die. Maybe there is some sort of afterlife, but there's a good chance that there isn't. The dread of this realization after 21 years of believing in heaven hit me hard. I'm still not thrilled with the unknown of death, but I'm at least starting to come to terms with it. After my existential crisis phase, I started to get more practical about dealing with my newfound philosophy. I used to pray every night and constantly throughout the day. It took me a while to stop praying before bed, even after I stopped believing in Christianity. I can't really explain it, but giving up my nighttime prayer felt like the final step and I just couldn't do it. Finally, one night I decided to break the streak and I haven't looked back since. I deleted my worship playlists from Spotify, I stopped wearing any shirts I've gotten from retreats and work missions, and I threw out any random items I had from that part of my life. 

My view on how I treat others has changed as well. Friends and family have always described me as almost too nice. My philosophy was that God wanted us to treat others with respect and ""love thy neighbor."" I'll admit that a lot of my viewpoint on how to treat others was largely religion-based. I did NOT, however, ever use my religion as justification for hate. I have always supported the LGBT community (mostly because I'm gay, but more on that later) and despised people that used arguments starting with ""your lifestyle is wrong because the Bible says..."" I also would like to point out that my kind of thinking is very much on par with how most Christians I know think, especially the younger generations. So please do not automatically pair religion with homophobia because from what I see, these people are a minority in the religion. After losing my beliefs, I still believe in treating people with respect and ""loving thy neighbor"" from a non-religious standpoint. We're all on this spinning ball together just trying to get through life and if I can make someone's day better just through a simple smile, it's absolutely worth it. Politically, I have also become a bit more liberal, as I believe we need to do everything we can to improve the lives of people less fortunate. No longer can I claim that these peoples' lives are simply temporary and that they will receive a perfect eternal life in heaven when they die. Life is all we get and it kills me to think that millions of people will only ever have a painful existence. 

Looking back at my life thus far, all I can really say is I wish I figured this out earlier. I don't blame my parents for raising me Christian. They only want what's best for me and truly think religion will get me eternal life. They are still phenomenal parents and I love them. 

But...

Christianity has absolutely had a negative impact on my life. I grew up worrying about EVERYTHING. I would stress about silly school assignments in elementary school. I would cry about any form of punishment from my parents or teachers (even if it were sitting out of recess for 5 minutes). And most of all, I would work myself into a frenzy over religion and if I were doing enough to get into heaven and please God. The threat of Hell is absolutely terrifying to a child. Every little thing I did I would think about how it affected my relationship with God. I thought by disappointing my teachers and parents would also disappoint God. I would even obsessively make sure sinks were off or doors were locked because there was that nagging thought in my head that for whatever reason God would be disappointed if something were to happen that I could have prevented. The more aggressive OCD symptoms were outgrown fairly quickly, but I still worried more than I should. To this day, I still have anxiety and I'm very suspicious that this was the root cause of it. To the credit of religion, however, a lot of this worrying was my own doing. Nobody told me that God would be disappointed in me for what I thought he would be. And my parents never used God as a weapon to get me to behave. I was naturally anxious as a kid, and religion simply made it worse. One poignant memory I have is coming to my parents in tears after reading Matthew 5:30 which says ""And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell."" I understand now that this is probably meant to be taken metaphorically, but holy shit did this not sit well with me as a kid. 

Now to one of the most controversial topics of Christianity: homosexuality. As I mentioned before, I'm gay (well technically Bi, but more gay than straight). Looking back, I had these attractions in middle school, but had no idea what the hell it meant, so I more or less actually knew in high school. Of course, as a Christian, I really didn't want this to be true. I struggled a LOT with if I could be both gay and Christian. For others, I felt like I could always support them because the Bible itself teaches love and respect and I always felt that homophobia is against what Jesus teaches. But being gay myself was a struggle. There are a lot of arguments that the bible does not condemn homosexuality, as the laws written in Leviticus are replaced by saving grace of Jesus (I won't get into it, that's something best researched by yourself). Plus enforcing the law that a man should not lay with another man is very hypocritical if you actually read what else Leviticus bans. I wanted to believe this, but I kept asking myself if it is worth the risk. What if I were to live a life with a guy and it turns out I was wrong and that homosexuality actually is a sin all along? Not to mention, my parents believed it's a sin and would be pretty disappointed to see their son marry a man. All of these factors, combined with growing up in a small rural town, left me more comfortable in the closet. It also doesn't help that I'm Bi and not gay because I could constantly convince myself that I'll just end up with a wife (which I still may) and not even have to worry about any of this. This led to me not going on my first gay date until I was 20, and still not truly being able to explore my sexuality as I should have years ago. So where does that leave me now? I'm about to be 22 and I just now am coming out to a select number of friends with my family constantly asking when I'm going to find a girl. I shouldn't be exploring my sexuality now. At LEAST I should have started college doing so and building friendships based around it. 

So now I need to consider my future with my newfound reality. My entire family is religious, save for my Atheist grandfather for whom I have a newfound respect for. I'm considering how/if to tell them. For now, I have decided that I will keep up the act for the foreseeable future. I went to church for the first time since dropping Christianity on Christmas Eve with my family. I can't tell you how strange it is to be an ex-Christian at a church. I'm also concerned if I have children what I'll tell my family. I will support my children in whatever they decide. If they end up joining a religion, I my be a little upset but I will absolutely support them. My parents will expect their grandchildren to be raised Christian and I'm not sure how this will play out. I'll burn that bridge when I get to it I suppose.

ek23ji|2020-01-04 20:38:03|Atheism, Belief, Gnosis and Knowledge|"*Myself and another Reddit user have been having a civil and really interesting chat about a few key topics. The conversation is buried deep down in an old thread and so most folks are likely never going to see it. Anyhow, as part of that chat I wrote up the following and given the response to an earlier post about some of the technical underpinning of the epistemology of atheism I thought it might be of some interest to a few other folks on here. So with that in mind I'm posting this as it's own thread. Hopefully some of you will have interesting views on what's said here. I'll look forward to hearing them.*

For any given proposition there are two possible truth values. And under the rules of bivalent logic each proposition must have exactly one and only one truth value. I’m not ruling out a challenge to bi-valence (for example, see Graham Priest) but I’m going to assume bi-valence holds given how universally accepted bivalent logic is. If someone comes back with a compelling case for an alternative I’m open to listening to their arguments.

We have some proposition: *Such-and-such is the case*

This proposition is either true or it is false. But it does not follow that we each need to take some view as to it’s truth or falsehood. And for most propositions the natural case is to take no view at all. Since for the most part we’re going to need some evidence to determine the truth-value of a proposition, and we’re often just in possession of that knowledge. Generally this never bothers us. We don’t tend to lose much sleep over having no view at all on the proposition “The number of frogs in Australia on the 13th of June 2006 was even”. It’s just not important to (most of) us. 

So what about belief in this proposition. First, let’s take a moment to be sure we are super clear on what it means to believe a proposition is true (or false). I take what is generally called a deflationary view of belief. In order words I don’t hold that there is any special mental state or mystical object. Instead, I view the phrase ‘I believe that x is the case’ to be a paraphrase of ‘I accept that x is the case’. It’s an expression of our attitude toward the truth condition of a proposition. This is not a trivial claim and it would be reasonable to ask me to argue for my position here. I’m going to refrain from doing so at the moment because it would tale me wildly off topic and it’s not yet clear that anyone is unhappy with this position. I just want to be up front about any assumptions I am bringing with me.

With all this in mind there are three and only three positions that a person can take: 

1: I believe that ‘such-and-such is the case’ is true.

2: I believe that ‘such-and-such is the case’ is false.

3: I neither believe that ‘such-and-such is the case’ is true nor that it is false.

I think all of this is rather uncontroversial. A person can either take a stand and accept that the proposition has a certain truth condition, of which there are only two to choose. Or that person can accept neither truth condition, abstaining from any view on the matter. Such as would be natural in the case of our sample proposition about the number of frogs in Austria at a specific time being even rather than odd.

Note that there is nothing special here about the nature of the proposition. We’re dealing only in the formal rules of logic and surrounding epistemology. We’ve not needed to mention anything about the subject matter. And our claims would apply equally well to any topic insofar as we were considering our acceptance of the truth conditions of a proposition about it. Also, note that we have mentioned nothing about reason or justification. Our discussion is limited only to what a person believes in regard to the truth conditions of a given proposition. Not why they believe that or whether we think that their beliefs are reasonable.

Because we have a special interest in the topic of the existence of gods we give the three positions special names. It just makes it easier to understand which of these three positions a given person is maintaining without needing to be overly wordy. That’s all the names are doing. The names we give these are: 

1: Theism

2: Anti-Theism

3: Atheism

Which are the ancient Greek terms for (1) belief in god, (2) the opposite of a belief in god and (3) the absence of a belief in god. We use the Greek terms because they’re not in the common lexicon and therefore it’s easy to distinguish that we’re using a technical term to mean something specific and keep everyone on the same page.

The term gnostic is another distinct Greek term that means knowledge. And likewise the term agnostic, means without knowledge. These terms are less well defined in common use than the above three. But we can take a moment to cache them out a little and get a handle on how me might best understand them in the context of our overall discussion.

As with the case of belief, let’s start with stating clearly what we mean by knowledge. Just as in the former case I’m taking what would be called a deflationary account of knowledge. I don’t think knowledge is some mental state, or some metaphysical object. Rather, I think the term ‘I know such-and-such is true (or false)’ can be paraphrased as ‘I accept that such-and-such is true (or false) *and I have good reason for this*’. The difference between belief and knowledge under this reading is merely that knowledge (implicitly) entails that the claimant have reason for their position, and that they be willing to share that reason upon request. 

This explains why we can deny someone’s claim to knowledge and not their claim to belief. In the case of belief all that is being claimed is that someone has a certain attitude toward a given proposition. But not that they have reason or justification for it. We can assert that their belief is wrong and that they ought not hold it. But we cannot deny that they have the belief. By contrast, when someone asserts that they have knowledge they not only assert that they have a certain attitude toward the truth condition of a proposition. But they go one step further and ground that claim by also committing to having a good reason for their attitude. And their knowledge claim can be tested by checking their reason. A knowledge claim that fails that test becomes a mere belief.

With all that being said we can then see that three possible knowledge claims are also offered to us that exactly parallel our belief claim structure from above. For any given proposition we have three choices: 

1: I know that such and such is true

2: I know that such and such is false

3: I neither know that such and such is true nor that it is false

There’s not a very clear historical account of consistent terminology for these positions. So in the interested of clarity and consistency I’m going to suggest that we use the same technical structure as above. We call a person that holds the first position a gnostic, the person that holds the second position an anti-gnostic and the person that holds the third position an agnostic. There’s nothing special about these words aside from by choosing this structure then the natural Greek meaning matches with the English paraphrase meaning, and we remain consistent throughout so we’re less likely to cause confusion and thereby avoid talking past one another.

Moving on we can then start to think about how the respective belief and knowledge positions might be combined. Not all positions are possible. Given that this is getting a little complex the following matrix will help: 

  

||Theist|Anti-Theist|Atheist|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Gnostic|Yes|No |No|
|Anti-Gnostic|No |Yes |No|
|Agnostic|Yes |Yes |Yes|

&#x200B;

With a moments reflection it should be clear why this table is the way it is. In the case of the Gnostic that position entails that someone accepts the proposition ‘at least one god exists’ is true. And therefore they cannot also be an anti-theist or an atheist, since that would entail the contradiction that they also accept that the same proposition is either false or that they have no view on the truth condition. Therefore all Gnostic’s must also be theists. If you know god exists you must also believe that god exists.

Likewise the same is true for the Anti-Gnostic with respect to being and Anti-Theist. The position of Anti-Gnostic is merely the assertion that you accept that the proposition ‘at least one god exists’ is false, and that you have good reason for doing so. Which entails that you must also be an anti-theist since being otherwise would be contradictory.

The Agnostic makes no claims to have any reason for their attitude toward the proposition “at least one god exists” and therefore is compatible with any of the three possible attitudes towards it’s truth condition."|Naetharu|False|https://redd.it/ek23ji|3|0.63|0|39|1|atheism

ekfvle|2020-01-05 17:19:47|Free will is destroying our future|"It's unfortunate but this religious myth even pushes into atheism and agnosticism. The belief that people choose anything is the major reason we don't fix any of our problems. The issue is if you believe everyone chooses to be the way they are then you ignore the factors that lead them to be that way and you ignore the possibility of changing the environment to change people and prevent it from happening again (mistaken assumptions of ""human nature"").

The reality is we could eliminate most poor behaviors by simply changing the way we live. For example you could eliminate stealing by eliminating monetary exchange and establishing a true egalitarian society. If resources are distributed evenly and everyone has equal access you have zero reason to steal anything. Stealing would be nearly gone.

The same could be said for most poor behaviors people have. We can eliminate most of them in future generations by providing a better living situation and education to everyone. If society truly understands free will doesn't exist then we can take control of our future to change human behavior for the better.

It's called social engineering. It exists right now whether we want to admit it or not. Having very little control or understanding of it has created widespread issues. We are conditioned to be who we are and to consume what we consume. We don't choose. So if we want people to be better in the future we need to build cities that are better and equal. It is entirely possible the richest amongst us has already figured this out and may be using it to keep things as they are or at least planning something in the future. We all need to come together with science to figure out a real future not something designed to remain in this market system or for some rich few to benefit most.

ejtsxi|2020-01-04 07:54:10|Disproving the argument that “without religion, we wouldn’t know what’s right or wrong”|"Heard my dad saying this the other day. People are already born with this instinct of morality, as proven by this Yale study on babies: 


“Not long ago, a team of researchers watched a 1-year-old boy take justice into his own hands. The boy had just seen a puppet show in which one puppet played with a ball while interacting with two other puppets. The center puppet would slide the ball to the puppet on the right, who would pass it back. And the center puppet would slide the ball to the puppet on the left . . . who would run away with it. Then the two puppets on the ends were brought down from the stage and set before the toddler. Each was placed next to a pile of treats. At this point, the toddler was asked to take a treat away from one puppet. Like most children in this situation, the boy took it from the pile of the “naughty” one. But this punishment wasn’t enough — he then leaned over and smacked the puppet in the head.

This incident occurred in one of several psychology studies that I have been involved with at the Infant Cognition Center at Yale University in collaboration with my colleague (and wife), Karen Wynn, who runs the lab, and a graduate student, Kiley Hamlin, who is the lead author of the studies. We are one of a handful of research teams around the world exploring the moral life of babies.”

ek6uw5|2020-01-05 02:46:41|I don't get it.|"When civilization first stabilized, nobody had the answer for anything. We hadn't analyzed, gathered, or tested information like we can do so easily today. Nobody really knew how grass grew, how far the planet extended, how natural phenomena occurred, etc. People had much reason to be confused and afraid. The belief in a higher being inevitably came about, and with that, different religions sprouted in different sections of the world. It could explain away things that one could not wrap their head around, like death, the stars, or unusual landforms. Humans tend to develop the same moral compass no matter where they come from, so religion had much overlap between society, and, of course, not so much in others. When one does not understand something, especially in a less intelligent or educated time, they will use emotion mixed with imagination (which evolves into susceptibility to superstition) instead of logic to conjure up explanations. Hence why so much amazing feats are accomplished in works such as the Bible. And also why some religions have strange restrictions that bar food and interaction with other crowds which other people may find weird. 

But religion was perhaps the one thing that kept civilization stable. People were able to establish moral standards and laws over time to function as a group. Of course, morals evolve over time when they ostracize people who don't fit the norm. This is found in the case of slaves, women, and homosexual people over the course of history. But also remember that morals and laws will be tested over the course of time, and the ones set into motion during a certain time period are simply products of their time: back when it was acceptable to judge people based on their differences instead of their personality. So, ultimately, religion was a beautiful thing. Without it, people would never function as large groups, and we probably wouldn't have been the intelligent creatures we are without having the mental capacity to start from a base for a moral code. Otherwise, we would be like the other lower order animals like dolphins, snakes, alligators: they don't believe in a god. They've never given it any thought. But as all species do, we must start somewhere. And religion was part of that start. Spiritual belief was necessary. And inevitable. 

Over the years, we found out things. Mathematics and the sciences were able to identify and explain the unexplainable. The statements in religious works were put into question, as they should have been. This will always be the case. As we continue to learn things about the universe around us, spiritual beliefs will continue to be put into jeopardy until it's entirety is hopefully completely eradicated. 

I myself have never been abused by a priest, or fully understood the deep corruption in the Catholic church, or been alienated by family due to religion. But all I will say on this is that, of course, religion and human nature will bring about corruption. Like I said, the reason religion is so popular at all is because emotion and imagination are so malleable and able to be manipulated. There will be people who use it for their own less noble gain, be it sexual or thirst for power. But, as someone who regularly visits this sub, I don't think pointing out the corruption of the church is the right way to point out why religion in itself is so bad. I only say that because most of the posts I see are from a news source identifying a priest who is a pedophile or a molester. I think that this sub should be used to point out the intrinsic flaws of religion instead of the daily posting of a pedophile priest. 

My gripe with religion is my own disbelief at how people refuse to see that it's nothing but mythology and fairy tale. People actually worship dead people and people who don't exist because they're so fragile that they can't comprehend a life without imagining a higher being to be pulling the strings. In a sense, we are arrogant, and in another sense, we aren't proud enough.

We are so arrogant that we must believe whatever higher being there is created us as their ultimate being, that time didn't exist before the coming of humans, that we were created in their image! How arrogant of you to believe the universe centers around YOUR species. That something you see to be so beautiful and vast must be the work of some force you believe in, all because you cant believe that this universe is just that great! It's just insolence! And you're also telling me that you can't believe we have accomplished such great things, that many of us have had hit and runs with death, conquered illnesses, have had multiple strokes of luck, that instead of passing that onto yourself or mere circumstance, you have to thank a non-existent motherfucker who somehow decided that for you?! We are the most intelligent species in the known universe! But that's it! The universe doesn't care about your feelings, and it is so much bigger than anything you can comprehend. There should be some pride that comes with that, but not to the point where you persist in worshipping fairy tales that twist the universe and all that is onto your finger!

I have a younger brother who will tell me shit like ""How could the universe come from nothing? That's enough proof that God exists!"" And how are you so positive that true nothingness ever existed? Even if something came from nothing, which is physically impossible, why would there be this creature responsible for it? Granted this sibling of mind is one year shy of even reaching teenhood, so I don't expect him to know anything. He is also the conceited type of guy who won't really consider what people who disagree with him say, and talking to him is like talking to a brick wall. Not that I don't love him, but damn, he is not the brightest guy. Even at 12, you should be able to form some sort of logic barrier for yourself.

When enough people believe something, it's easy to just tag along with it. It's easy to dismiss them. It's easy to call them idiots simply because they don't believe in God. Indoctrination is a scary thing. Were I born 85 years ago, I might believe in God. But for no legitimate reason.

I just hate that people will believe in something that is so obviously not real. Even if it doesn't change who you are as a person, it irks me. You only have one life to live. Don't do it feeling indebted to a dead guy. Don't do it for someone who didn't exist. Do it for you. Because you're the person driving the wheel for your life, you might as well be your own god.

So apparently today young christians in my country group up, dress up, one of them blackfaces themself and they get a parent, then they roam around on local streets and knock on everybodys doors. If you're stupid enough, you open them, they sing for you, you give them a small monetary donation, they write a code on your door and leave. We call this tradition [""The Three Holy Kings""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi) in german and its been celebrated ever since.

Well, those guys just knocked on my door and of fucking course, I didn't open it. This scenario just reminded me of how much I despite religion and every single aspect that comes along with it, so here it goes.

As long as I remember, my father was terminally ill. He had a form of ALS (remember the ice bucket challenge or whatever?) which caused his muscles to slowly fade away, so he was forced to lay in bed and was pretty much like 95% paralyzed and couldn't do anything by himself, my mother sacrificed a big part of her life to care for him.

My earliest memories of him go back to when I was like 6 or 7 years old, I remember him always  being there for my sister and me, always listening to our stories and ""playing"" Pokemon with us on our GameBoys and watching stupid little kiddy TV shows with us. Before the outbreak of his disease he had an engineering degree and worked as a highly ranked serving firefighter in a leading officer position (don't really know the exact english terms - sorry!), he was loved by all his colleagues, friends and of course, his family.

In religion classes in school they taught us ""if you're a good human being, you will experience good things"", they always me to be the best person I can, believe in god, behave well and you will get into heaven. The information of my sick father soon leaked to my school and my religion class teacher tried morally helping me. I actually don't blame her or anything, she was a good person just trying to help, thinking back, I actually appreciate her. The problem I had was: we prayed so much... sooo, sooo much. All the time. They always told us ""pray for him and he will get well soon"". I knew this was made up, he probably won't ever recover and I came to terms with that (I think), but please god, don't let my father die.

When I was 9-10 years old, the condition of my father got worse and worse, there were periods were he was hospitalized for a few days to a week, but he always came back. My sister and I usually stayed at my grandparents or cousins overnight when his condition was too bad too handle. Whenever we got home and he was still there, it was the best feeling ever. I didn't care that he wasn't able to move, didn't care that he needed help with everything, he even got a respirator at some point. He was my father and I loved him.

My father passed away in 2004 when I was 10 years old. I still remember that day. I used to stay at my cousins a lot, on that specific day my mother and my sister came over aswell, we all gathered up. My mom teared up and asked us ""Do you know where Dad is?"", we answered her with ""at home?"". She shook her head and started crying... we asked again ""At the hospital?""... she just started crying and didn't say anything.+

You know, I always kind of got that whole ""be good and you will experience good things"" as a 10 year old. Based on that, I could explain war and stuff for myself, if those guys decided to ""be bad"", well, they will experience bad things and end up in hell. Same goes for crimals and ""bad people"" in general, if you choose to live ""a bad life"" you will ""experience bad things"". That all made sense for me, however... based on that logic, why the fuck did that god let my father die?

What kind of world is this were you only do good and STILL experience bad? What kind of god lets a great human being suffer like this FOR YEARS and FOR NO REASON? Why didn't the countless prayers help in the slightest? Why did a god allow all of this to happen to an innocent 10 year old? Religion can't answer me those questions and it never will.

My parents were the best humans I ever knew, they never did a bad thing in their life, they were always there for their children and everybody else. My father was a role model to me, I looked up to him and loved him, I have so many great memories of him, writing this whole thing made me tear up several times.

I'm 25 years old now and the loss of my father ripped a hole into me that left a void. I was greatly affected by this and never overcame the fact that hes gone. I pretty much needed therapy my whole life after that but only started recently in 2019... way too late.

ejtuv9|2020-01-04 08:00:36|The main reason I became atheist|"There is a plethora of reasons I’m atheist. Like so many reasons — I could make 50 posts about it.

For instance, once when I little, my cousin was looking up articles on dinosaurs and his dad, an avid Christian, saw him. He looked at my cousin sternly and said “Do you believe in dinosaurs?” My cousin said yes. His dad responded “Dinosaurs are not in the Bible!” And preceded to spank his son for daring to believe in dinosaurs.

So that experience and others was in my 5 year old tiny mind as my cousins also told me things like how I should fear god, because he could kill me any moment. And I was learning too that other religions existed. None of it sat right. Then my younger brother was diagnosed with autism.

Probably around age 10, I was laying in bed after I had just finished reading Genesis, as I felt obligated to do. And I remember so clearly that the thought popped into my head “But my brother doesn’t believe in God? And he can’t ever believe in God. So will he go to hell?”

My brother is severely autistic. He can barely communicate with us, let alone pick up on abstract concepts like religion. My brother has no moral structure and is not impacted by societal norms. He’ll pass gas in public, strip down naked in front of people, touch random folks and does not care what others might think about any of these behaviors simply because he’s not capable of that sort of thought.

I’ve always thought this made him like other mammals, like a dog or a cat. Autism strips the higher level processing from a person.  He’s as pure and innocent as a human can be, like a puppy. And of course puppies couldn’t go to heaven because dogs don’t believe in god.

There seems to be a consensus that people incapable of believing in god sort of automatically go to heaven, like children. And that’s what I was told more or less. (Though some asshole did tell me that it was unfortunate but my brother was doomed). But I wasn’t actually ever concerned about my brother’s salvation. What I wanted was some description of autism specifically in the Bible. And learned that the Bible really made no exception for people with autism, just like how the Bible didn’t even mention dinosaurs. Even though dinosaurs clearly existed. Despite all this information supposedly coming from an omnipresent being.

I didn’t become atheist really after this. I just truly thought that the Bible was nonsense which was a major breakthrough. I was thinking things like “humans wrote it not god, that’s why” and still believed in a god and by high school I felt that maybe all religions were just different tellings of the same story. By the time I hit college and learned about the first religions and how they spread and picked up on some anthropology, I abandoned the god thing all together.

I feel that there’s a chance it would have taken me much longer to become critical of what I was being told without my brother. Now my understanding of the world is a lot more nuanced, so I like to pay homage to that period in my life."|purplecatuniverse|False|https://redd.it/ejtuv9|18|0.88|0|10|1|atheism

ejgkys|2020-01-03 15:06:25|New here... Ex Mormon served a two year mission, married in the temple, and was active for 10+ years|"Cross posted on r/exmormon after the suggestions..

I just found this sub last night after realizing I am an atheist. I was holding onto a hope for a God for so long, finally realizing if there is a God, he’s a fear-based bastard that left me to die. 

My shelf finally broke with my divorce right after I graduated from BYU. As a Mormon I always believed in eternal families that I would be with my family for all eternity. Until I started questioning my church, faith, and belief in God, my then wife of 4 years (2 kids aged 2 and 3) filed for divorce and it was finalized in August. It completely shattered my belief in eternal families which the church came with it. 

I then went to a Christian non denomination church because my Hope of a God was still there. They would preach that God will always be there for you. I was in the darkest moments of my depression with the loss of my family and my faith. At this point my depression was so bad work performance decreased and I was fired from my full time job. I Was on the verge of suicide. 

One night I remembered in church the preachings that God will never let us down and still had that hope. I ended up giving it all telling him everything and asking for some sort of feeling of love and comfort to tell me everything was going to be ok. What I felt was absolutely nothing. I was absolutely devastated. I continued this practice for about a week with no response and from there, decided it was all bull shit. This was around September of 19.

Since then, I never went back. I never felt the spirit in the Mormon church when so many others would confess that the “spirit is strong.” I didn’t feel anything.

The older a work of art is, the browner the skin, the curlier the hair. I’m just curious as to when the white appropriation of Jesus’ skin color began to occur? It seems that often Jews remained brown and foreign in artworks, while Jesus’ skin became paler and his hair became straighter as time went on.  Was it the Popes? He seems to be turning whiter during the end of the Middle Ages.  I’m not sure this is the right place to ask, but I find the level of knowledge and discussion here to be above par.

So my mother goes to church and goes frequently enough I've gotten to know some of the members by proxy. 

But there is this one lady who will not give up on trying to convert me. 

The other members have sorta learned that I will believe what I see and if a god appeared in front of me I'd still be skeptical. But back to the lady. 

She won't for the love of a cat give up. I mean she literally will launch into religious talk and ask me about how I feel about it. She gets me ""materials"" and forever gifts them to me. I just leave them in the laundry mat when I go do laundry. 

I find her efforts ridiculous. But I'm just happy to believe in karma and that things happen because it comes back to bite you if it's bad. 

But boy does she keep trying. Like I appreciate you trying but it's gonna take alot to change my mind. She's the person of why i quit going to churches and trying to find something to believe in.

ek5mbp|2020-01-05 01:05:03|Simulation Theory, Atheism and Creation|"So this is going to get some hate I'm sure, but I had a comment earlier where sim theory came up. Firstly, let me preface this with the fact that I don't believe in God, or religion, or any of that nonsense... but every time I'm faced with simulation theory it gives me a kind of existential dread and I'd love to hear some theories against it, beyond the usual ""I think therefore I am"" which, presumably, would also be a facet of the simulation, seeing as the entire point would be to simulate everything, thought and consciousness included.  

Bearing in mind that we already have pretty complex, procedurally generated worlds (e.g the video game No Man's Sky), and that we have really only scratched the surface in terms of our technological advancement as a species, and further assuming that exponential growth continues into quantum computing and beyond... can anyone rationally prove that a. the big bang wasn't the on switch being flicked on our simulation, and that b. our universe isn't expanding into the available storage of whatever ""hard drive"" holds the data?  
Of course all this begs the question of if the simulation(s) are being maintained and/or actively messed with, it also implies creation and implies a beginning and presumably an end.  

When you look at our subconscious decisions, and the crazy way that the world seems to run (wars, insane world leaders, governments and individuals that seem to quite often do the opposite to what would normally be considered common sense), can anyone give me good reasons not to think this could actually be the case?
Could human belief in higher powers be some form of latent knowledge built into the simulation, even as an in joke, or some such?  

There have been lots of documented ""glitches in the matrix"", and things like déjà vu could point towards this reality being a highly powerful piece of computation with built in error correction.  

We already have theories surrounding multiverses, as well as paradoxes such as Schrödinger's, how does everyone here think those play into simulation theory. Is there more you all can offer here, either for or against?
If you believe that we are simulated, do you believe it's by humans, and to what possible end?
If not, then why not?

Edit: Just to make it clear, I don't believe it myself but the theory's and comparisons to religion interest me, hence the discussion!"|delphininis|False|https://redd.it/ek5mbp|0|0.33|0|99|1|atheism

Growing up I would never call myself religious but I absolutely believed in a higher being and that I & my family were somewhat 'protected' for want of a better word, because we always did well in life and luckily enough never experienced tragedy or any major death, illness Yadda Yadda.
So much so, that I would get defensive of people who mocked my religion.

I'm a science / tech loving guy, so at the back of my mind has always been this big red flag and flashing light going off like ""SERIOUSLY, YOU BELIEVE IN A CLOUD FRIEND?!?  ""...but I always rationed it by saying ""everyone I know and love is healthy and well"" so yeah, Naked cloud friend it is.

Fast forward to my 30s and shit sure as fuck hits the fan, and Fucking lots of it ... I mean copious Biff Tannent ploughing into truckload of the stuff amount !! (that's one for the teenagers)

Mom gets sick before my wedding, double brain tumor. Dies six months later.
Mother in law dies six months later due to Ovarian Cancer.

Two school friend die of cancer, one of suicide, two more die of accidentally overdosing on drugs.
Cousin the same, another cousin suicide, and an uncle (great guy) died of a heart attack.. all in about 14 months.

I don't follow the religion so whatever. This summer i wanted a dog but my dad said the same old made up rule about dogs not being allowed. I haven't been religious in over a decade but before that I used to go to a religion class and I know my way around the religion decently. So I told my dad his rule is fake, it's something that was made up in his **culture** back when dogs were actually spreading disease and stuff through their fur and spit and such (hence the rule). But now dogs have vaccines and dont cause mass plagues to spread. My dad listened to reason but maintained his stance on the no dogs because religion rule. I asked what it would take to get a dog and he said *""Go to the mosque and ask the scholars there if dogs are allowed""*. As soon as he said that I literally sprinted down to the local mosque, found the scholar and asked to have a word with him. The nice man took me into his study and we searched the Qu'ran for any references to dogs, he knew where they were because he memorized the book. So after a quick look through the Qu'ran and a chat with the scholar I was told that dogs are actually allowed, the book even says their prophet had a dog, his friends had dogs, they even prayed with the dogs near by. These are all things my dad said are not allowed. So I took a note home to my dad and now I have a dog.  

Moral of this experience?  

Don't trust religious people to know what they're talking about. But we already knew that didnt we?

However, it presented an opinion regarding religions (but more so ideologies as a whole) that I handnt considered before, and found very interesting. 

The gist being that tribal man was unable to cooperate in groups larger than a few hundred individuals. Humans were not interested in helping or working with others they did not have a close connection to. 

However, advent of religion and ideology enabled humanity to cooperate in larger and larger groups. For example, individuals following the same, or similar religion, even without knowing each other intimately, are able to cooperate closely. Similarly, more modern ideologies (nationalism, communism, even capitalism) enable humans to cooperate in larger groups in much the same way. Aka, an individual willing to die for their nation just by their own personal identity, or how we all put trust in money and can cooperate across national lines because of it. 

Anyways, thought it was interesting and new viewpoint for me.

ejz33l|2020-01-04 16:59:17|What to do about catholic school ceremonies?|"I was hoping someone here has gone through something similar to our situation and has some suggestions. I live in rural Ireland and every primary school in a huge radius around us is run by the Catholic church. We knew before our boys started school that we would have to deal with things like First Communion and Confirmation, but haven't yet decided what to do about it, though the deadline is coming soon enough. These ceremonies are huge deals in schools here. They spend school time practicing and preparing for the day, and the Parent's Association (of which I'm part of - sort of relevant because my kids see me working towards these things) prepares a party at school after the ceremony where their whole families can come and the kids get to sit at their own 'high table' and feel really important. There are only three kids in my eldest son's year group so he will really stand out if he doesn't participate. Technically, children don't have to do it, but they make it really hard not to. When my eldest started at the school I had decided he could sit the religious education out and he could do some reading or maths on the computer. But with only three kids in his year... it made religion even more of a point for him, so we compromised and said he doesn't have to do the homework (which is pure indoctrination, so I cringe to think what they're saying to them in class e.g. my 5 year old has told me that Jesus is always with him). 

So now First Communion is coming up and I'm stuck on how to handle it. My husband thinks we should keep him out of it, but it's a BIG deal. Our eldest will absolutely think he's missing out. He may wonder why everyone else believes in God, but his parents are the only two people in his world who don't. I hate either choice just about equally really and was hoping there might be another I'm not seeing, or any advice to deal with the one we end up going for.

ejrcku|2020-01-04 04:02:23|Why I quit believing|"As to clear up a post from earlier. This is probably gonna be a bit of a r/rants moment.

I grew up in a church. I truely believed that if could just have this place away from all the chaos growing up I'd be ok. 

But where was god when I was beaten and literally fractured by fists that I wished would just stop. 

Where was he growing up in multiple homes and places as I was told I was better off dead. 

Where was he the day I was shunned by the church for asking questions about life outside of It? 

Or being beaten on by bullies.

Where was that God all Christian faith believe in when I was raped and cried for help. Then beaten again by fists because my abuser thought I was lying. 

Where was he in my suicide attempts while I cried into my pillow because I simply thought death was better then living? 

Where was he when my abuser beat me so badly I struggled to hold back tears, but the only thing I could think of was next week's basketball game. 

He wasn't. No saviour no grace no all seeing being should not have had some intervention at all those times in my life. 

It broke me worse when I struggled to hold on. So I gave up. I was the only one who's gonna be the person I want to be. I can't rely on anyone and sure as hell will keep everyone at a distance till I can sort of respect and trust them. I've long healed most of my dark places. Some of them still lurk. But fuck you if you try and push a belief on me. 

Your bibles can burn. Your temples too. I am not your sheep. No matter how you try, you'll burn with me in that dark place too. 

Because I believe in myself and that karamtic energies in the world will get what's coming. I'm going to put forth all the good I didn't get to see in small doses while still being a selfish dick every once in a while.

ME:  That’s not how it works. You are the one making an assertion, that a god exists. The burden of proof is on you as the one making the claim. Can you prove Santa Claus DOESN’T exist?  Of course not. The only thing you can say to someone asserting that he does is to say there is not enough evidence to prove he is real so until you can provide such proof, I choose to believe he does not exist. 

Do you believe in the thousands of other gods that have been worshipped throughout human history?  Of course you don’t. You are an atheist when it comes to those gods. I am just an atheist to one more god than you. 

Have a nice day. I hope you find Ryan. 

RYUN:  I didn’t make the claim that there is a God but I am now and I would be more than willing to provide you with actual facts. I am ready to bare the burden of proving to you that there is a God if you would take the time to sit down together and talk about it. My thinking is that you are claiming to be an atheist because there hasn’t or isn’t enough evidence show to you to prove there is a God but I am positive that you cannot even begin to explain to me that there isn’t.

Much conversion of the pagan people doth occur, but there's this one tribe where the Bishop blesses a river and an entire village marches through it to be converted to christianism.

There's a mighty banquet in the evening and the Bishop has pride of place beside the tribal chief. As they're chatting, the chief mentions he's looking forward to meeting some of his warrior friends in heaven.

""Oh they won't be there,"" says the bishop. ""They didn't die as Christians.""

So the meal's halted and chief marches his villagers back through the river to undo the blessing.

One of my teachers(I'll refer to him as Mr. Bible since he's my Bible class teacher) is ironically my favorite teacher due to his relaxed teaching style and understanding of my opposing beliefs, in fact he encourages dialogue from opposition. Which is where you(hopefully) come in, dear reader.

Mr. Bible has used/referenced a lot of popular arguments for Christianity, most of which I mentioned only get him as far as deism, but which I can't specifically prove false entirely. 

Here's the arguments I struggle with most:

1. Leibniz's Argument: Everything in the universe has an explanation for it's existence, and if the universe has an explanation for it's existence, it's god. Since the universe exists, god is the explanation.

2. The Kalam Cosmological Argument: Whatever begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist, therefore it has a cause.(this one is annoying because he'll say god is timeless or whatever.)

Over a year gone, though, the more I'm realizing how nonsensical everything in the Bible sounds. The more I hear it, the more I realize just how dumb it sounds. A few months ago there was a lesson in my youth group about the end days (rapture, tribulation, second coming of Jesus, etc.) and, instead of me really trying to block it out as wrong, I instantly recognized that it was utter bullshit. The Earth will be consumed by fire, and there will be a new heaven and new earth? Yeah, right. Sounds like something ripped out of Lord of the Rings or some shit. I truly don't know how one truly believes that it will happen.

Granddaughter's/Daughter's  family is pretty much atheistic..maybe a bit A-lite so they've never thought much about teaching defense skills to a 5 year old for this situation.

As my Daughter put it regarding the event: ""Last time *kiddo name deleted* went over there somebody told her that if she doesn't believe in jesus she's going to hell and she's having a terrible time processing it.""

It was apparently strong and pushy enough that it's been rolling around in my Granddaughter's head and causing some fear...and of course partially fed by some of her kindergarten friends parroting what's been shoved into their heads.

Granddaughter is in that stage where she's just learning to differentiate between make believe stuff and real stuff.

So..I pondered what words I would use with her to try and explain without just calling it all a load of bullshit.  She can do that as an adult if she wants but right now, that half is also part of her family and I don't want to get so aggressive on the subject that my Granddaughter is given a disrespect for them.

Any suggestions for a couple of simple sentences on the subject that a 5 year old might understand well?

1. A being with Omnipotence and Omniscience exists. (Assumed)  

2. Free will exists. (Assumed)  

3. The being in point 1 knows every action you would take if given the opportunity to. (Omniscience)  

4. The being in point 1 has the power to change your free will to change your action. (Omnipotence)  

5. Because of points 3 and 4 there is either no Free Will because the being in point 1 both knows what you will freely do and has the ability to change your free choice and thus you have no choice in the matter, or the being in point 1 does not exist with the qualities given. (Conclusion)  


Now, if you think point 5 is invalid because the being in point 1 has free will, that's both not what's being claimed and not true. If you replace all mentions of you with the being, you should see why.

I realized just how toxic the school environment was, so I began paying more attention to the teaching I just chose to ignore.

He spends entire class periods explaining why women can't be priests (and never actually answering). He always claims ""Now this will be controversial"" but never actually gets to the root of the problem: He's being a damned sexist homophobe half the time.

So, back to the point of the post, I decided to talk to my parents about this issue in the school. I had recently come out to them, so I felt like I could approach them about it. My dad kinda laughs along with me about the ridiculousness, so I'll give him respect for that. My mother, however, defends this man with a passion. Whenever I say something slightly negative about his methods, she rants at me. She's still Catholic, which makes this all the more annoying.

When I explain to her that my teacher hates my very existence because I have a boyfriend, her tone shifts to a certain ""I'm not trying to be controversial... BUT"" and then she tries to justify what he's doing. I'm sorry, mother, I thought you'd back your son instead of backing a man who tells me I'm going to hell on a baseless assumption.

Do you guys have any advice for something like this? I only have a semester left in the school if all things go correctly (leaving the damned place and going to college early). I just have no one to actually turn to for this stuff."|StarPup01|False|https://redd.it/ejipqh|28|1.0|0|7|1|atheism

Due to this I have had my fair share of conversations, arguements, etc about religion. Through this I have learned a things I think everyone should know

1. Just don't

9 times out of 10, dont even bother. If you dont know the person or know they wont converse/argue in good faith, do not engage. This will save alot of time and make you alot less angry at people.

2. Guide the discussion yourself

In my experience, if you let the religious person take the lead, you will usually have a bad time. You will end up going around in circles until you start screaming at each other. So you, kind friend, take the lead so you actually reach a deeper understanding with one another

3. No one will change their mind

Almost every conversation I've had about religion resulted in zero change in ideas from either participant. If your lucky you will understand one another at a deeper level, if not, everyone will walk away mildly annoyed.

4. If they start asking you to ""prove it"", don't

Asking someone to prove the lack of something that cant be proven is impossible. For example, I believe you cant prove the existence of God/Gods, therefore there is no God/Gods. If someone were arguing the contrary with me, the burden of evidence (prove it) is not with my claim, because it is born from the lack of evidence. So the burden of evidence would fall on the other person.

5. Have fun with it

Religion is an inherently absurd notion, so arguements surrounding it will pretty quickly enter into absurd territory. Take a step back from it and laugh about it. It will result in alot better of a time."|Ball_Breaker89|False|https://redd.it/ejtnhl|2|0.57|0|12|1|atheism

Also, feel free to correct me or fill in gaps in my knowledge. 

My understanding is that of the different flavors of Christianity, Orthodox varieties have the most books in their bible canon, Catholics use a few less (but otherwise include all the same remaining books), Protestants use a few less than Catholics, and the Old Testament is more or less equivalent to the Jewish Tanakh.

And, it seems that as you go through the progression from Judaism -> Protestant -> Catholic -> Orthodox (less books to more books), there is only addition of new books, but no removals. i.e. the Catholic bible includes ALL Protestant books, plus extra.  And Orthodox bibles include ALL Catholic books, plus extra.

So theoretically, there should exist some orthodox bible of some sort that includes every book considered canon by some flavour of Christianity, and you can just selectively ignore books as you get closer to the Protestant end of the spectrum.  Is this correct?

And if so, what bible might that be?  Syriac Orthodox? (it seems they have a couple more books than Eastern Orthodox)

I always thought it'd be interesting to find a version that has ""everything"".  It'd also be interesting to see what each iteration of Christianity decided to drop from its canon, and why."|explodingtuna|False|https://redd.it/ejul16|0|0.5|0|6|1|atheism

ej4h12|2020-01-02 21:18:33|I used to be a Mormon missionary (sorry if I knocked on your door)|"I served a full 2 year mission for the Mormon church- and I loved it. I was THAT GUY. 

If you lived in the northern Colorado/ Wyoming area, I probably knocked on your door (sorry about that). I was raised in a very religious, Mormon household. I read the Bible and the Book of Mormon on my own before I was 13, I attended church with my incredibly large family every week, I got married in one of the temples, I attended the church’s school, etc.

Basically, what I’m saying is there were not very many people who were as full of the “spirit of God” as I was. All of that began to change when a very kind atheist (don’t remember his name), invited me into his home when I knocked on his door.  As we tried to preach Jesus to him, he responded with well-reasoned and logical arguments.  He was the first person to ever help me critically analyze my beliefs. After many encounters with him, we realized that he would never see the light and accept Jesus, so we left.

Over the years, I encountered many more people who helped me critically analyze my beliefs, but he was the first one who got me to start asking questions about what I believed. Towards the end of my 2 years (oh my god two whole fucking years) of proselytizing in the name of Jesus and the Book of Mormon, I started to take a religious apologist stance as I realized that most of these questions would never be able to have satisfactory answers.

About a year ago, I began reading books by philosophers and scientists. As I began to attend college and think critically for myself, these questions came back, and I found answers.

I have been free from religion and god for 6 months now. I have felt more genuine and honest than I ever have before. I have a new enthusiasm for life and I finally feel a weight lifted off my shoulders. I do good things just for the sake of doing good, not because I think god is watching. I feel more satisfied than I ever have before.

Nobody is ever too far gone. Never stop helping people critically analyze their beliefs. You never know who you might save. I have no way of thanking this person who first helped me to think critically about my religion, but I will never forget what he did for me. 

Seriously though, if a Mormon missionary who devotes their whole lives to Jesus and to a cult founded on the teachings of a pedophile can be de-converted, anyone can. 

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

TL;DR never stop trying to help people critically analyze their religion/beliefs, you never know what could happen

Edit:

For all those asking about how it has affected my relationship with my wife, without going into too much detail, it’s been really tough. She still has a strong faith in the Mormon church and I’m not sure if she will ever leave (one can hope). For now, I’m just trying to do the same thing others did with me- show respect at all times but also ask some interesting questions every now and then. She’s responding much better to that!

Also, for anyone who wants a powerful kicker question, I was asked this-
Why did god give such barbaric laws in the Old Testament? Either he changed his mind, or he is a pretty sadistic god.
My only answer to this as a missionary was that the people’s receptivity to gods “real laws” in the Old Testament was much less, so god had to dumb it down.
He then followed it up with the fact that god is supposed to be an unchangeable god, which eft me unsettled so I changed the subject lmao

I’m looking for input on how to handle some parenting dilemmas I'm wrestling with and I'm sure many of you have dealt with similar issues before.  Thanks in advance to any of you that chime in.

My wife and our three kids live in a small town in a generally conservative and religious area.  My wife and I are both atheists, though most of our friends, family, and coworkers are not.  My mother-in-law is particularly in love with Jesus, but she's very respectful of our beliefs and doesn't push anything.

Our oldest child just started kindergarten this year and this is where the fun begins.  My wife and I both work jobs with fairly decent commutes, so we had to find a before and after school care for the kindergartner.  Essentially our only option was a Catholic school that provides this care and also buses the kids to and from the public school each day. On days where public school is closed, the Catholic school is still open as a daycare.  As you would expect, they pray before all meals and snacks.  Having just gone thru Christmas season, I can tell you they REALLY put the Christ in Christmas.  The kindergartner is just going through the motions now and doesn't ask too many questions, but I’m starting to wonder if I should be more proactive.  I don't necessarily want to force my beliefs on to my children, but I also don’t want them to be casually indoctrinated into Christianity, either.  He knows the words to the prayers they say, but he doesn't get the meaning just yet.

We really need to take advantage of this school for all 3 kids, so this is just the beginning.  While I don't want to use a religious school, it's a much more safe and stable option than anything else in our town.  I'll take any and all comments and advice, but since this verges on rambling, let boil this down to some specific questions:

1. How do you encourage your kid to be skeptical in this environment without also turning them into an asshole?  The last thing we want is for them to become ostracized by teachers or other kids.  Is there a certain age where this is more appropriate to address?  A kid can believe in Santa until they're 10+ years old and then completely and suddenly lose that belief.  Is the same true for religious mumbo jumbo?

Aight so we all know that how the Bible treats foreign slaves is utterly fucked. There’s no justifying that.

however, i read an article by a theist that was attempting to justify the slavery among the fellow hebrews.

i’m going to play devil (or God’s??) advocate here for a second.

There’s a verse that i see brought up about how if the master hits a tooth or eye out of the slave, the slave is set free but the master isn’t punished. but wouldn’t that be payment? let’s say the slave is doing $200,000 worth of work (because the hebrews were, as far as my understanding and correct me if i’m wrong, could choose to sell themselves into what seemed like indentured servitude to pay off a debt.) so by setting that slave free, the master is really paying a fine of (to go with the example) $200,000. the slave’s debt is gone.

and also, couldn’t the Hebrew courts judge who would be in the right when it came to specifications? 

and if the slave accepts these conditions going into it, where are the issues? i feel like i’m missing stuff here, so please help me out on it. i’m trying to build a stronger case for this. i feel it’s one of the most blatant and immoral things within the bible, and i want to have every argument accounted for.

So as the title suggests, I’m having a bit of difficulty coming up with a way to tell my family I’m an atheist, that won’t go horribly for me.

You see, I’m a Canadian Teenager (not saying exact ages) who was raised in a Christian household. 

Dad’s not really religious (he shares the same views on everything as the rest of them, maybe not for the same reasons though idk), but Mom is and my Grandparents on her side of the family are even more religious than she is.

I haven’t believed in their god, or any god, for at least 5 years now. But they don’t know that. I’ve been putting on church clothes when they drag me out to it, and proceed to zone out into daydreaming until the service is done. 

They’re the type to have strict gender roles, be very concerned about “sin”, and be very homophobic and transphobic. 

They have a view of my life as a Obedient stay-at-home Christian Mother with lots of kids. 

Which doesn’t exactly work well with me, a Bisexual Trans man who wants to never have kids (biological, adopted or otherwise). Yeah the only thing I’m willing to ever raise is maybe a pet or two. 

They’re also the type that believes that their god is the right one that everyone must believe in to be saved, and that biological family is the most important thing in the world and should always be together, no matter what pain they put you through 

Again, doesn’t work well with me, as soon as I legally and financially am able to, I’m leaving this place, no contact, goodbye, hope to never see you again after all you’ve done to me

So yeah back to the reason I made this post in the first place, is there a way I can tell them I’m an atheist without it going horribly? Should I just wait until I’m able to leave and get the hell out of here, never telling them? Should I do something else??? 

I don’t know, I don’t really have anyone to turn to with this and I’m really lost and confused."|just_here_cause_done|False|https://redd.it/ejpz6q|2|0.62|0|12|1|atheism

I’m quite into self-help books and trying to improve myself. One concept I’ve run into several times is that strong belief in something can actual make it come true. It sounds ridiculous at first, but consider this: 

Imagine you’re going to a party and you believe it’s going to suck. Your friends won’t be there, not much to do at this location, etc. You go in there with an attitude that won’t have any fun, and as a result, you sulk in the corner and don’t engage with anyone. Because of this, the party does suck for you and you think you were right.
Alternatively, if you believed it would be fun, you would had gone with a better attitude and may have had a good time, again confirming your belief.

I’ve seen this discussed with stuff like your career, money, friends, and relationships. When you believe that a better reality isn’t available to you, you self-sabotage and confirm your beliefs. But when you really focus in on something and believe in it, you can create new opportunities for yourself and have a more positive mindset about it, which benefits you,

This is where prayer comes in. I was taught my whole life that if you keep praying to god about something, he will eventually give it to you. This might actually stem from what I previously described. Constant prayer every day is much like a form of meditation. You are concentrating on the things you want, and you genuinely believe it’s going to come true. As a result, you are more likely to make choices that will make your wishes come true.

“It is a tedious cliché (and, unlike many clichés, it isn’t even true) that science concerns itself with *how* questions, but only theology is equipped to answer *why* questions. What on Earth *is* a why question? Not every English sentence beginning with the word ‘why’ is a legitimate question. Why are unicorns hollow? Some questions simply do not deserve an answer.

ejti58|2020-01-04 07:21:14|Honestly kind of a good point|"I was talking to one of my Christan friends and he says something along the lines of ""if I'm wrong, nothing happens, if you're wrong, you'll end up in hell for all eternity."", I was thinking that was kind of a good point but not anything that could make me waver in my beliefs, or disbeliefs rather. Then I remembered that ""heaven"" would be extremely boring, it's like you finally get to meet the guy you worship and just, what, continue worshipping him for eternity? I feel like I'd rather go to Hell because, it'd be kind of interesting be tortured, in that sense at least, in life it'd be horrible, but if I'm immortal and being tortured I feel like it would be kind of interesting.

Edit: Ok I realize this is not an actual good point, I just really didn't look into it, I looked into it as, ""do I care"", instead of ""is there any validity behind this claim at all"" which I now see, there obviously is not, based on the fact that there are multiple religions and the fear of punishment is not belief anyway.

The first thing she says is ‘I guess your dad got what he wanted’.  We continued taking and all was fine but it was clear that she thought I was being duped and weak for having given in after all these years. 

The nail in the coffin to me was her saying goodbye with the word ‘salam’ (peace) instead of ‘Assalamualaikum’ (peace be upon you) a distinction we were raised to make a on purpose between Muslim and non-Muslim. . I hoped parental love went further than that. 

I’ll conclude by saying that the lack of empathy and self-empathy in the family and social circles resulting from our religious Muslim upbringing where there is only absolute right and wrong has just proven how hurtful it can get. 

That’s not who I am. That’s not the partner I intend on being and that is not father I wish to become. I made my choice of my own mind and I stand by it even after countless reassessments. 

I stand by the value of the value of knowing myself and getting to know others indiscriminately with curiosity and understanding.

ejtl8f|2020-01-04 07:30:45|I’m a Christian, but|"I’d just like to say, a lot of the Christians talked about are the ones taking it to the extreme. I’d like to clarify:

1. Not all Christians hate LGBTQ+
       - I myself, am a supporter of the community. Not all of us are homophobes, and we don’t trash them for their feelings. Some of us don’t care about someone’s sexuality. I relate to this personally, as I too have been struggling with my sexuality. There are even some LGBTQ+ Christians. 

2. Some of us are Pro-choice.
        - Many of us believe that the woman should have control over their own body. We do not thing that the child should be kept just because it exists. Sometimes it’s for the greater good, as the mom is still a child, or it’s a traumatic remind, or the mother simply can’t care for the child.

3. We’re not all about forcing people to change their opinion.
        - most of us respect other people’s’ religion and don’t try to force Christianity on them. I.E., I have many friends with very different religions and beliefs than me. Hinduism, Wicker, Buddhism, and Atheism. Not all of us immediately put somebody just because of their beliefs. That is somebody who takes Christianity to the extreme.

4. I’ve seen some comments calling Christians stupid and uneducated.
         - I am a Christian for multiple reasons.
A. I was born with it
B. I have faith
C. Sometimes it just nice thinking that somebody is always looking out for you.
         - We’re not stupid, we’re just trying to have faith in something. We’ll never know what’s out there for sure, but we can have faith in something. It’s just nice thinking somebody is always looking out for you, even maybe when you don’t have anybody else at the moment. Christianity makes us feel safer

Please don’t take this as I’m trying to change your opinions. I’m just trying to express that not all Christians are alike. Please don’t sort us into one big group of the exact same people. We can have very different values and priorities. 
Thanks for taking your time for this!

It's not an issue when something changes but I was reading the comments on a video about women trying on the hijab and it got me wondering. 

The subject of ""modesty"" kept coming up in the comments. ""Modesty"" depends on what your culture says is modest. There used to be cultures of women who'd walk around with their boobs uncovered.

Islam asks men to cover their elbows and knees and women to be ""modest"" which I seems to mean no body outline, shoulders or wrists. Many traditional African clothing defies all of that. Men and women sit among each other without fear of an orgy breaking out.

There are South East Asian and South American cultures that have allowed body modification. Also a sin in Islam.

The idea of ""animal sacrifice"" being some sinister thing  because of the cultures its associated with. It's no different to Kosher and Halal. Kill an animal, pray, wash, cook and then eat it.

ej96kv|2020-01-03 03:06:24|Today is official - Happy New Year’s to me!|"I never posted on Reddit before, but I wanted to share  with you all and this community. 

I grew up believing that there was a “God” within a Christian household (I am from the Midwest). It wasn’t as hardcore as most people, as my family is  more progressive and liberal, but we always occasionally went to church here and there. We used to go to the Mormon church pretty strongly back when I was a kid, and I almost believed it at some points (but it never lasted as I wasn’t much of a church person anyways and I always hated getting up in the morning to go). I suspect my mom never really believed in Mormonism either and just went because of some people. However, we left maybe when I was an underclassman in high school as my Mom finally decided it was time to leave as the church was all based on lies and secrets. I have an older sister and I found out she was an Atheist around this time, and honestly thought she was crazy for not believing that there was a “God”. In past years, my mom made us go to different churches to find the right one (about 3 different churches, a couple mega churches). Although, we only went around some important holiday most of the time. 

It’s always been in the back of my mind, but I never wanted to think about there not being a God. For whatever reason this past semester in college, I really started questioning. Potentially because I got super high on weed lol. I will be graduating college soon and I wanted to finally face the truth. I didn’t want to live my life a lie. I started realizing that us not wanting to think outside the box and that there isn’t a God or we would go to hell for thinking that, is complete brainwashing. Since then, I’ve been talking with a couple close friends and really discussing it. I also started researching online and mainly read through a lot of intellectual posts, this subreddit, and the debate religion one. 

It just didn’t make sense that I was born into the “right religion” compared to the thousands of other religions across the planet, as someone else put it. And going a step farther, it doesn’t make sense that we were born into the right species (humans) as we would be in “His” image. Any other species has no concept of a God and it makes sense. It’s our own human nature and intellectual trait that has led us all down this path. And praying? I never really found the point in it. Like if I want an A in my class, that’s all me and my hard work, and your will has nothing to do with it. And all these people of religion? They’re the most hypocritical, always judging and whatnot. These churches? Always taking your money because it’s a business. And “God”? An all supreme powerful being that is inconsistent with his actions. There’s too many inconsistencies within in the Bible, paired with no evidence to make it the most convenient. There’s a lot of others things and deep facts of course, that led me to reach this conclusion. But today it’s official and I share it with all of you:

I am free from these shackles of hell, brainwashing, and ignorance. I am a new person and 2020 marks a new decade of truth! I am proud to now call myself an Atheist.

The sad part is though, with this new found perspective on life, I realize that we must stay surrounded by those who haven’t yet found the truth themselves."|The_Voraz|False|https://redd.it/ej96kv|14|1.0|0|2|1|atheism
