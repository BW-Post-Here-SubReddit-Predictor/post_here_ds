eknh27|2020-01-06 02:39:34|Security guard didn't down play my fear|"I have just got home from studying/working in my university's 24hr study area. It's 2:30am and I have barely slept in 48hrs due to a major deadline. As I was leaving the building I suddenly got a huge bout of anxiety and dread about walking 3minutes to my on-campus accommodation. 

I decided to go back and speak to the security guard until I felt better to walk home instead he walked me to my house and waited until I was inside with the door locked to leave.  

The only questions he asked was about the cause of my anxiety and if it was something he could deal with like someone hanging about. He chatted with me the whole walk back distracting me from how I was feeling. 

It's nice to know that students at my uni can ask/be offered this. Especially knowing that we won't be judged for the reasons why."|KillerB34|False|https://redd.it/eknh27|6840|0.96|1|234|1|twoxchromosomes

ekectz|2020-01-05 15:28:31|I was raped by a family member and never pressed charges. Today I found out he is being charged with felony rape for assaulting someone else.|I don’t even know how to feel.  A mix of relief, anger, and guilt. I was raped by a family member several years ago. I was drunk and I was convinced by my family that I wanted it and It was my fault because I was drunk. I was newly 21 and young and stupid. My mom told me not to tell my dad because it would kill him. When my boyfriend found out and threatened to kill my rapist, my mom told me it was my responsibility to get my boyfriend under control. I never went to the police because I thought if my own mother won’t believe me how would anyone else. Today I found out he raped someone else. He is being charged with felony rape on the other side of the country. How my family reacts to this will make or break my relationship with them. I feel relieved that I now have validation that I was raped and hopefully he will finally face some consequences. I am angry that my family didn’t believe me and convinced me it was my fault for drinking. And i feel guilty that I didn’t press charges and that this happened to someone else.

ekwr64|2020-01-06 16:56:18|UK woman who was allegedly raped, had revenge porn leaked and faced a sham trial set to receive a pardon|"Article from today:  
[https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10682346/ayia-napa-brit-teen-pardoned-cyprus-preisdent-fury-conviction/](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10682346/ayia-napa-brit-teen-pardoned-cyprus-preisdent-fury-conviction/) 

The problem with the pardon is that it won't clear her name. Her lawyers have indicated that they will push the case to the EU, where it'll probably clear her name as the trial and the investigation was a massive joke. 

For those who haven't paid attention to the case, six months ago an at the time 18 year old British woman was allegedly raped by a group of men. She was having consensual sex with one guy, while another one filmed her without her knowledge. Then, his friends broke in and allegedly forced themselves on her.

She went to the doctor, and they, after examining her, contacted the police.  
The police, after doing a poor job searching the hotel (they missed a crucial piece of evidence: A bloodied condom found by another occupant a few days later), chose to interrogate her.

The interrogation lasted eight hours. She was not given access to a lawyer and they intimidated her into retracting her accusation. The police claim she did it willingly, and that her story had ""many holes"" despite the cops not being proficient in English and not providing her with a translator. Why can't we verify anything? Because the cops conveniently ""forgot"" to record the eight hour long interrogation.

She was imprisoned, and the men freed. The men released her name, along with revenge porn, to the internet (which is highly illegal), and celebrated by chanting ""The Brit is a whore!"" when they landed in Israel. One of the men turned out to be the son of a retired politician with ties to upper government.

During the trial, she wasn't allowed to present evidence of her rape, as the judge claimed that the trial wasn't a rape trial, but a ""public mischief"" trial. Think about this: You're accused of making up rape accusations, but you're not allowed to present evidence of your rape.

Tomorrow, she will be sentenced, and is facing one year in prison. She has PTSD, barely interacts with anyone and sleeps 14-20 hours a day. The thugs who released revenge porn and allegedly raped her are meanwhile running free. Several human rights organizations have voiced concern about the sham trial, and it has prompted a debate about the way Cyprus' judicial system handles rape cases, as the country has the lowest rape conviction rate in Europe. Women's rights demonstrators from Israel, ashamed of the conduct of the men, have traveled to the country to protest Cyprus' broken system.

Internet myths:  
""But there is video evidence of her having consensual sex with a group of men!""

No, there isn't. The video the internet used as 'evidence' was four years old, and featured a completely different woman. She was raped six months ago, not four years ago. The only videos available are the revenge-porn ones showing her having consensual sex with only that one guy, and it conveniently cuts off when other guys enter the room and she tells them to leave.

""But one of the accused men was with his girlfriend that night!""

Yes, which is why she didn't name him as a rapist. She only named one guy. The others were merely suspects the police rounded up, and DNA evidence and confessions linked 7 of the 12 to the crime.

""But she has previously made such allegations!""

No, she has not. This was a completely unsubstantiated lie repeated by Cypriot media outlets in the first weeks. She hasn't had run-ins with the law before this, as either the victim or perpetrator.

Tomorrow, she will be sentenced, and the story will inevitably pop up on various subreddits where once more the internet will be thrashing her based on newspaper headlines and myths.

Even if you think she has lied about the rape, you cannot deny that the Cypriot judicial system has completely botched the case, showing incompetence that even the foreign office of the UK had to comment on.

ekxbcg|2020-01-06 17:35:52|Uber tried to kidnap me yet I still feel guilty about yelling|"On Saturday a friend and I went drinking, we were walking to bars in the neighborhood till we decide we might like to dance down town a bit. We called an Uber since we had both had quite a bit to drink so far, everything seemed normal and fine. A black truck matching the description picked us up, he turned on some music and we small talked briefly. His English wasn’t great so we kept it short. He was driving the right way till he took one horrible, terrifying turn that took us away from down town and across the river. People disappear across the River, it’s nothing but fields and meth labs. That small town across the river has more missing people than the Capitol of our state. 


I immediately tell him he’s going the wrong way, he ignores me. I say it louder, he tries ignoring me again. So I shout for him to turn around or I’m calling the cops, he tries to buy time says oh tell your friend to check her destination on the phone. Her phone confirms he’s going the wrong way. She’s not the confrontational type (neither am I honestly) so she’s been quiet and uncomfortable next to me. Her phone is showing a route switch. I am shouting at him at this point to turn around or I’m calling the cops, he is telling me I’m over reacting. I’ve got my phone out and I’m dialing. 


He turns around, my friend is apologizing. I end up apologizing too, thinking maybe we put the wrong number in. I’m terrified. He drops us off four blocks from our destination. We go to a bar and sit down. We check her Uber history. This guy has only made 5 trips, all tonight. He canceled the trip when we got on the bridge. He had no intention of taking us where we planned. We almost got taken. I’m drunk and losing my absolute mind. I call my boyfriend to pick us up, I sob the whole way home. I sob when I get home. My boyfriend puts me in a bath with a candle then puts me to bed with secret life of pets 2. 


It’s been two days and I’m still a bit scared to leave my house at night. I suppose nothing really happened. What if it was a mistake or a glitch in the app? What if I was just a grade A bit** to this guy? We have proof it wasn’t but I still feel like this. I never yell at people, but I was so scared. What would have happened it I didn’t yell though? I wanted to go to the cops but my friend said no. My boyfriend also said no? It wasn’t on my Uber account so I couldn’t do it. My friend did report him to Uber but ... what if he just picks up more drunk girls? I’m still really upset about it, I don’t think I’ll ever trust an Uber ever again. 


I want to confidently say I’m not over reacting and I was justified in yelling. I’m allowed to be loud. I’m allowed to express my fears. If you are in trouble, why wouldn’t you yell. Right?"|handzie|False|https://redd.it/ekxbcg|18|0.86|0|17|1|twoxchromosomes

That includes feeding, playtime, cuddling, and coaxing out those gummy grins.

My whole little life wasn't ideal. I never had a time where I could pinpoint feeling happiness. I endured many deaths, severe mental illness, abuse, just enough to make me never look forward to waking up the next day. But since becoming a Mom, I feel great pride and joy. I even have energy to develop side hobbies, so my identity isn't just ""Mom"" but ""woman who does things and is a Mom"". 

This little boy is my world. Helping him learn emotions and words and how to use his body brings me just such a sense of accomplishment.

ekv324|2020-01-06 14:50:17|Went on probably the best date of my life|"I just got out of a very long relationship with someone who constantly made me feel inadequate and gaslit me into that thinking I was jealous, paranoid, and insecure whenever I brought up suspicious of infidelity. He was very anti PDA in any way, which made me feel hidden. 

This weekend I went on a date (several dates actually) with a man who told me how much he liked me. He said I was enlightened, smart, interesting. He referred to me directly as amazing, incredible, unreal, sexy, beautiful. I haven’t had someone look me in the eyes and tell me I’m beautiful in my life. We got together again at a bar and he kept holding my hand under the table, touching my leg. 

I’m still hurt from my past experiences and overwhelmed by this amount of love being given to me and unsure of how to handle it. I’m being wary and cautious but honestly I’ve never had anyone treat me this way even after years of being in relationships. I feel absolutely seen and valued. 

To anyone in a bad relationship, coming out of a breakup, or feeling like they aren’t being treated how they deserve - it’s ok to ask for and expect more. It’s ok to still feel hurt even in the face of new love. You deserve to be treated how you expect and deserve."|GlassPudding|False|https://redd.it/ekv324|8|0.72|0|5|1|twoxchromosomes

this scared me shitless because i’m only 23. my mom tried to comfort me because she said she’s had fibroadenomas in her breasts since she was 19, and they are nothing to worry about. i just was terrified that it was something else. 

so about a week ago i went to get a biopsy. honestly it didn’t even hurt, given that they completely numbed my boob. it lasted about 10 minutes and the doctor was extremely comforting and told me everything was going to be ok. 

so i have been a nervous wreck, but today i got a call from my doctor that it’s exactly what she thought - benign fibroadenomas. i’ll just have to keep on getting them checked to make sure they don’t get any bigger. i’m just so relieved :)

lesson learned: ALWAYS do a breast exam at least once a month. if you feel even a little something off, go see a doctor. it's very important to be proactive."|ilovebees69|False|https://redd.it/ek61az|10761|0.95|2|169|1|twoxchromosomes

Why do I need to come here? If I want to run, I can just run in my neighborhood. If I want to lift things, I already have weights at home. I can swim, but I don't enjoy swimming, so that's right out.

It didn't dawn on me until a few days ago that while I didn't need its services, others do. And by others, I mean women.

I'm an able-bodied man. Sure, I'm not athletic by any means, but I have a job which requires physical exertion and I'm in decent shape, if a bit overweight. I can go out into the neighborhood for a walk or a run, and sing along to Disney and/or Broadway songs and the only person who ever stopped me was a little girl asking if I wanted to buy some lemonade.

One time, when my car broke down late at night, I had to walk about a mile home with both of my hands full. No one bothered me. No one stopped me to offer me a free ride, or to lift the objects I was carrying home. Hypothetically, if someone offered to help, they wouldn't be persistent in offering their help to me.

If I were a woman... I suppose it would be way different.

And now I know why y'all pay for indoor exercise areas. Why you go to the gym instead of doing what I do and just randomly walk/run outdoors.

ekn632|2020-01-06 02:15:30|I was raped on my birthday 6 years ago.|"This might be a trigger for some people so please proceed with caution. 

6 years ago, I had an orchestra concert. I was in middle school and this year the concert happened to be on my birthday.

After the concert, my friends wanted to go to chick fil a and I went with them since I wanted to eat before I went home. One of my friends parents took me and my grandma said she would pick me up at 9pm (the concert ended at 7pm). 

9pm rolls around and my friends and their parents take off since I told them my grandma was almost here. I waited outside of the chick fil a since I felt bad for being in there but not eating anymore. 

Half an hour passes and my grandma still isn’t here. I called her. She said she had fallen asleep but she is on her way right now. I told her not to rush and get hurt and she said she won’t. 

About ten minutes after we hang up, this guy walks up to me and asks if I was okay. I said yes my grandma is coming to pick me up. After I said that he started to walk away to the parking lot, but he suddenly turned around grabbed me and covered my mouth. He ran behind the chick fil a and started to do what rapists do. 

It starts getting bad here. So please stop if these things easily trigger you. 

He started off by making me suck his dick. It was so horrible. Tears were just streaming down my face. I was too scared to scream or say anything, so I just opened my mouth and let him do whatever. I couldn’t stop crying. After a few minutes or what felt like hours of this, he started to kiss me. I didn’t kiss back. I just stood there. Completely dead inside. Crying. He started to touch me and I felt so disgusted. I cried more. He was about to put himself inside of me, but I got a call from my grandma. He clearly got scared and pushed me down and ran off. The phone rang for a few seconds while I tried to stop crying. I answered the phone. I said hello? My grandma responded with I’m here come outside. I said okay and hung up. 

I still couldn’t stop crying but I texted her and told her I needed to go to the bathroom. She said okay and that she’d go park in the parking lot instead of waiting at the front. It took me about 10 minutes to calm down enough to get into the car without her noticing anything. I got into the car and she asked how my time with my friends was and I said it was great. 

I don’t know why I didn’t tell her. I don’t know why I kept it a secret for 5 years.

A year ago, I got my first boyfriend ever. We’re teenagers so of course we wanted to try things together. A few months into the relationship things started to get heated one time while I was at his house. We had talked about doing this stuff together before and we were both okay with it. I was clearly more hesitant than he was but I still really wanted him to be my first. 

I had let him touch me before and I had touched him before too. Although I would never look at his privates. I was too scared to. He thought it was weird and didn’t understand why I didn’t wanna look. I told him that I was just new to this and still a little weirded out. 

But this time, he wanted me to suck his dick. And badly. I told him I wasn’t ready to yet and I wasn’t sure what I was doing. He was really sad about it but he kept begging me to do it. After 5 minutes of him begging me I started to sob. It was all coming back to me. He was confused and scared he did something wrong. He begged me to tell him what was wrong and I tried to calm down enough to tell him. After 5 minutes I calmed down enough and told him everything. He felt so bad because he thought that I felt like he was forcing me to. But I told him that wasn’t the case. 

He was the only person to know for a few months. He encouraged me to tell some of my other close friends and I did. Things slowly got better for me and I started being happy again. I got a therapist and told her what happened and she gave me some coping skills that have really helped me the past year. 

I encourage you, if anything horrible has ever happened to you, to please tell someone you love and trust. It gets better and I know it doesn’t seem like it should. Good luck to everyone out there <3.

ekxh3p|2020-01-06 17:47:31|Came back from maternity leave to a different schedule than what I was told I was getting...|"I suppose this is just more of a rant but I need to vent...The gist of it is that I delivered my daughter very premature so while she was in the NICU I came back to work for a couple of months and then took maternity leave when she came home. 

When I first came back I volunteered to drop to a 32 hr work week (to save my coworker from being forced to do it- the boss man wanted to make room in our dept to add another full time 32 hr employee) as my husband and I can afford it and honestly it saves in child care and I get a day to just enjoy hanging with my daughter. So I was working M-Th until maternity leave hit and it was already discussed and agreed that I would have the same M-Th schedule after. 

So last week... I’m looking forward to coming back after maternity leave (I very much enjoy what I do and was also stoked about my schedule) when I find out... I was schedule Tu-Fri. And THIS was going to be my schedule. And the only reason I found out was because I asked to see  the January schedule the week I was scheduled to return to work, otherwise I would have come back Thursday January 2 not even knowing I was scheduled the next day and also not having anyone set up to watch my daughter. 

So my nanny cannot work Fridays and I worked HARD to find the right person as my daughter needs extra help and attention due to her prematurity... so not just any person or daycare situation would fit the bill. And consistency is important. She has LOTS of doctors appointment, many I had scheduled for Fridays “knowing” I was not working.  And as I’m sure you can imagine, the specialists we are going to see don’t exactly have tons of open appointments that make rescheduling easy. 

The reason the boss man (my supervisors boss) insisted it be different was so that the cute young new girl who flirts shamelessly with him could have Fridays off. So she can go out and party. (I know this for a fact, as she has actually told me that herself) She has worked there about 7 months and called out more times than my coworker and myself combined (with about 4.5 years of employment between the two of us). 

I’m hurt and furious and feel that she is being given preference and not because she is a better or more reliable employee... ever since she came on board it’s been drama drama drama and our 5 person dept (would be 6 people if we could keep ourselves fully staffed)  morale has plummeted. This girl knows exactly what she’s doing and brags about how she manipulating our boss. She thinks it’s great since she gets everything she wants. 

I have a meeting today to “talk about the schedule”... which I had to insist on and boss man scheduled it for a Monday. My day off. 

I have plenty of valid points to make and am mentally prepared to have this discussion but am so disappointed that this is even happening.

It still hurts.

When he tries to talk to me he keeps saying “you just nag and nag and that’s why I lost my temper”. Surely I’m not deserving of that?!



EDIT:


Wow thank you all so much. I didn’t expect to get so much advice about this, so so appreciative for all your comments.

The thing is, I’m not afraid of him and I don’t feel like I can’t escape or need a restraining order or anything. I just feel hurt and frustrated because I don’t understand what I’ve done to deserve this.  Deep down I know if it escalated more seriously I could take him on, but that’s not exactly a good relationship.

I’ve been having pangs of guilt today in work. I’m fighting it because I know I’ve done nothing wrong, but at the same time I keep feeling bad. (I’m aware this is stupid)

I’m going to think about what to do tonight. He is out with work until late so this gives me some time to plan what I want and what I need to do. I have a friend a few streets from me and she would let me stay if I ask her. 

I’m just so terrified to leave, not because I’m scared of him, but because we’ve built up this life that for the most part was perfect. And I’m going to throw it all away."|OfficeGirl29|False|https://redd.it/ekjjff|109|0.92|0|101|1|twoxchromosomes

I’m scared to leave my husband. He denies cheating on me and gets defensive and gets mad that I’m bringing it up.

Mid December, I (26F) got my first smear. I know, it took too long ... But I was always too afraid to get one. Anyway, about a week later I got a text from the nurse saying to call them urgently. Trouble was, I was on a cruise for my honeymoon (yeah, worst timing). I panicked, but I found a way to contact them. She said I needed to see a specialist, that it was urgent and that I was a high grade referral. I think she said something about possibly needing surgery. I'll admit, I was a little 'deer in headlights' and didnt completely take in what she said. I was absolutely beside myself. I always thought; these things don't happen to me. But now, what if they do? 

Anyway they closed for the Christmas break. I wasn't expecting to hear from them for a few weeks. I know they said urgent, but the public health system doesn't move too quickly. Well, I got a call at 1pm yesterday (their first day of opening) saying I have an appointment today at 2pm. This just stirred up all the anxieties I managed to hide for the rest of my honeymoon. 

I've done a little research and I know that I won't likely find out any results today ... But how do I cope with the anxiety in the coming weeks? I have reached out to my works free counselling service, but the first appointment they would give me is in two weeks...

ekt2v2|2020-01-06 11:46:00|I’m reporting a coworker|"I’m on mobile so I’m sorry for the formatting.


I have a coworker, (let’s call her E), that’s been preforming sexual activities with employees and clients, both AT WORK  and outside of work. And I don’t mean like just casual hookups here and there. She was openly fucking our last boss (at work and outside of work), fucking a couple employees, she’s fucking our top clients, sucking clients dick for Ritalin, etc. I’m a very sex positive person, but this is way over the line. Both the new boss and assistant manager know about all of this, yet they “don’t want to get into it, she’s a great addition to the team”. 

Are you fucking kidding me?

I’m also worried about her children. E brings her 8 and 5 year old daughter to these random men’s houses to hookup with them. She also always talks about how she is raising her daughters to be open about sex and constantly tells everyone her 8 year old is pansexual. I’m no fucking expert on child development but I don’t think 8 year olds can totally understand the complexities of sexuality/sex/gender and gender identities at that age. I also think this is affecting her kids because she is married and her husband lives at home with them, but she is letting the girls meet and stay at these men’s houses with her. 

I know her personal life is not my business but I don’t want anything to happen to her daughters while she is bringing them around all these random old men. 

This whole situation has just been weighing on my mind and I’m losing sleep. I don’t want to go to work anymore and be around her. I’m uncomfortable and I don’t think it’s right that she’s getting a free pass because people don’t think these kinds of things matter when a woman does it. 

When I told my manager I was uncomfortable with how she is acting at work and what she has done, he said “it’ll be an HR nightmare and she’s a top employee. I don’t want to get involved.” I’m so sick of this and I don’t think it’s okay. At this point I either report her to HR or I quit and find another job.

I’m sorry if this is all over the place, it’s 4 am and I needed to let all this out. If you guys have any advice on how to handle this I would really appreciate it."|iitvb|False|https://redd.it/ekt2v2|7|0.64|0|11|1|twoxchromosomes

ek2ndn|2020-01-04 21:17:54|I was the dumb girlfriend.|"I'm a woman grown, now. I can look back at my youth are recognize, in retrospect, that I was groomed at 18 by a 27 year old narcissist. I can see the red flags that I was too naive to see, the calculated way he cut me off from friends and family, the small aggressions that escalated slowly enough that it warped my idea of what normal was.

One of his favorite things to ""joke"" about was how dumb I was compared to him. He'd never done anything with his life and rarely was employed for more than two weeks, but he acted like he knew everything. He knew exactly how to twist what I said to make me seem like a confused idiot. And he said it ""affectionately"" so that I didn't have a good excuse to be angry.... I had to internalize it or be called irrational.

As the years went on, Google became a thing and I started fact checking him in real time, which he HATED. He resorted to saying I was so dumb I had to rely on Google to know anything. But his grip was slipping. When a friend offered me a spare room, I moved out under the pretense of living closer to work, so I didn't have to wake him at 5 in the morning. He caught on too late to circumvent it, and the friend who I moved in with completely banned him from our home.

I rebuilt who I was, insulated from his constant harassment and stalking by our mutual friends, all of whom responded to his declaration that ""It's her or me"" the predictable way. More and more he showed his hand and all the secret abuse was suddenly out in the open. I was safe, and learning to be myself again. But that whole ""dumb girlfriend"" feeling was hard to shake.

I fell in love with my perfect man. We got married; my ex's two childhood best friends were groomsmen. I managed to maintain absolutely no contact with my ex as the years moved by. And then, this last year, my husband said that if I wanted to go to college, we could afford it. I was terrified..... I was dumb girlfriend, remember? I took the placement test and even after 2 decades out of high school, my scores were high enough to jump right into college level classes. I took the plunge. I enrolled.

I don't care where my ex is, what he's up to, or anything about him as long as he stays the hell out of my life, so I'll never actually get to tell him this.....

ekj7b3|2020-01-05 21:15:25|The joys of being anywhere near feminine and staying alone at a hotel.|"I went to stay with my boyfriend out-of-state.  Since my flight was buttfuck early and the lightrail does not start at 'buttfuck early',I opted to stay at a hotel that is literally within walking distance of the airport overnight.  THey had work the next morning, and I figured it was easier for them to check in with me, stick around for a bit, and leave in the evening, leaving me alone around dinner time.

&#x200B;

So, I go outside to explore the dining options before eating at the hotel's admittedly, overpriced restaurant.  I'm literally outside the hotel, casually checking Pokemon Go while I wait for a traffic light when I am approached by some guy who asks about my game, I half-enthusiastically carry the conversation for a total of two minutes, before telling them I have friends waiting for me in my hotel room and they're probably wondering where I was.  At first, this guy says he's staying at the hotel, and he'll walk me back since it's ""not safe"".  I tell him I'm fine.  The hotel is so close that I can look up, and literally see my room.  I tell him as much and he proceeds to follow me, carrying on the conversation, or trying to, as I'm walking briskly and trying to get in the hotel as soon as possible.  I really didn't believe this was the hotel he was staying at and figured once I got inside, he'd take the hint and fuck off.

&#x200B;

Of course, he didn't.  The moment he is in the lobby, in front of reception, mind you, he starts making grabs for my hand and telling me we should go to my room and party.  Me, being polite, tell him ""uh, no, sorry.  the room is full.  my friends are upstairs waiting for me.""  I didn't want to cause a scene, even if I was visibly uncomfortable and still pulling my hand away when he tried to hold it.  He kept trying to tell me it was okay until I finally said ""Hey, I have a boyfriend.  He's upstairs, waiting for me.""

&#x200B;

This caused him to finally back off, and leave the hotel.  Because of course, he was bullshitting the entire time about staying at the hotel.  I'm lucky he did not continue to try and follow me to my room to call me on my bluff, both about having other people in the room, specifically my boyfriend.

&#x200B;

Sadly, I've stayed in hotels alone before, usually at cons, which is where I learned the tactic of never telling people you're staying by yourself (I prefer having my own room at a con after one-too-many bad experiences).  If I don't get people I just met trying to crash there, I get sleazeballs or both.

&#x200B;

Please be careful if you travel alone, especially if you have a predisposition to be polite and nonconfrontational like I usually am."|hughjacoc|False|https://redd.it/ekj7b3|42|0.89|0|8|1|twoxchromosomes

ME: You said you want to ""start"" as friends. I'm telling you that's where it's going to end. Not start with. I was assaulted last night by another guy who I felt guilty saying no to \[that's another loooooong story, this convention was so fucked this weekend\], so from now on I'm giving very clear answers to people. I did not feel anything with you, this is where it ends, I am sorry. That is my final answer. There isn't going to be a ""start with and then see where it goes"". I really do not want to deal with men who don't listen right now and I am trying very hard to be as polite as I can with you right now. Last night was very difficult for me after I was almost assaulted and I am not in the mood for men who don't listen right now.

&#x200B;

HIM: I'm listening. Now and in the future. I don't mind staying friends if I'm allowed to visit. If you were assaulted you should have told me I would have immediately came to your aid as a friend regardless if you told me if you said you wanted to stay friends or not. I look out for my people. Yes, I barely know you but being if someone is assaulted I will be there for them even if I'm a stranger. I care too much for people with nice auras. But yes I agree to your terms. Whatever.

They weren’t strong enough to knock the wind out of me but were definitely uncomfortable enough to keep me up most of the night. Luckily I never had anything that felt close to a contraction. I had read up on many o’ woman’s experiences and was expecting the worst. It’s day two and I’m still bleeding. Emotionally drained. Tired. Guilty. Shameful. 
If you have anything bad to say, please be considerate and keep your opinions to yourself. I already feel terrible. I’m not at all proud of doing this. It wasn’t a fun experience that I would actively consider doing again. It was hell. I feel like shit emotionally & just really need support.

Me and my boyfriend had sex last night for the first time. We didn’t use a condom, he did pull out but yeah it was a fucking stupid thing to do. I told him after that next time we have to use one because I can still get pregnant even if he pulls out and we definitely don’t want any babies, and let’s not be stupid. I’m also going to go on brith control soon but I’m still deciding what type, and my anxiety is playing up about it so I’m working through some things in my head first. 

Anyway I’m super nervous about asking for it, like I feel dizzy and shaking nervous. Pathetic I know. What exactly do I even ask for? Probably over thinking but I always like to be prepared with what exactly I should say. 

Also I heard it works by stopping ovulation but I’m pretty sure I ovulated last week.

I am coming up on the 3 years since my Nexplanon implantation. 

I barely remember specific details involving initially having the BC implanted because I was taking anti anxiety medication due to having just being raped days prior. Plus I also think the trauma from the assault caused my brain to block out the surrounding days to where it is all just a blur. I remember feeling the pain/pressure/pinching but the doctor and nurses kept me distracted during the procedure which helped a lot. They were all so incredibly kind. 

However, now it is time to have the implant removed and I am kinda scared and would like to know what to expect.

What was your experience like during removal?

Did you have a new nexplanon implanted right away? 

Now that I am not on anti-anxiety medication and in a better mental state-what can I expect during implantation of the new nexplanon?

After removal, was the Nexplanon implanted in the same arm or is it procedure to implant it in the other arm? 

If there was a healing process after removal, what was it like? 

Does the removal require stitches? 

I have read about the removal via google but I feel that hearing first hand experiences will help me to better prepare myself.

ekppf5|2020-01-06 05:50:44|being bisexual while in a relationship with a man|"I've been mulling over this for a few days and if anyone has any similar experiences I would really appreciate hearing them. I've known my attraction isn't limited to men since I was 12 or 13, and by high school, I was comfortably out but didn't feel comfortable enough with myself to date anyone yet. I had many crushes on both men and women throughout high school but hardly acted on them simply because I didn't want to date yet.

In my first year of university, I dated one man briefly, but ended things soon after because we didn't really click. I spent the following year dating around more often, having some liberating and eye-opening sexual experiences as well, and overall felt very excited and happy about being able to discover more about the person I am. Over the summer I met a wonderful guy and we're in a relationship that makes me incredibly happy.

When I brought him to my best friend's party about 6 months ago, a friend of the host's who I went to high school with, upon realizing I had brought my boyfriend said to me, ""I knew you were always straight."" 

This greatly upset me. I felt as though I needed to prove myself by saying no, I've had sex with and dated women too! But that felt absurd. It felt absurd to have to divulge my romantic and sexual history to someone I hardly spoke to. I talked to my boyfriend about it afterward (he's also bisexual) and he made me feel better.

Last week, another party at the same friend's place and the same guy asked me whether I was ""still bi"". I said to him, ""I can be bi and in a relationship with a man."" He tilted his head to the side and said, ""Yeah, but that's not really...""

""Really what?"" I replied. ""Am I only bi if I'm single and constantly fucking men and women? You don't know anything about who I've dated or slept with.""

At this point he backed off and made up some bs about ""But that just means I hardly know you!"" as though this was a reason I should feel obligated to tell him more.

This time the comments hurt more. My whole life I've felt comfortable with my sexuality and the past few years have just reaffirmed the relationship I have to it. To have someone suggest that it was ""just a phase"" and insinuate that I had grown out of it because of the one relationship they're aware of upset me.

Do any other bisexual or queer women relate to these experiences of invalidation? I'm really grateful my partner can empathize with these problems because he truly does make me feel understood and valid but I'd appreciate any sharing of similar experiences. And to any other queer women, I want to say that your queerness isn't contingent on your romantic or sexual history. You are queer because you know you are."|joyseul|False|https://redd.it/ekppf5|4|0.7|0|12|1|twoxchromosomes

ekskgq|2020-01-06 10:52:52|Working towards healthy relationships as someone who has been abused? Questions about physical intimacy|"\[trigger warning: relationship/sexual abuse\]

In light of not being able to get/afford consistent therapy, I have a relationship question I'd like some feedback on if possible. I (25f) have been in a couple abusive relationships, and usually the pattern has been that I swing from being codependent with longer-term emotionally/mentally/sexually abusive partner to a series of ""validating"" hookups, and repeat. I've taken some time off (about a year and a half) from any intimate relationships to try out therapy, and also develop myself.

Now that I've moved, changed jobs, am trying to get my life on track and make myself proud, I am easing back in the dating world I'm questioning how to go about intimacy in a healthy way. Specifically, physical intimacy as I'm wondering if rushing into it creates conditions for people to more readily take advantage/be opportunistic with no intention of ever wanting a relationship. I'm searching for a healthy connection and I'd like to get to know the person without feeling insecure about whether or not they like me or are just using me for sex. Is it too hard a line/unrealistic to not have sex with anyone until you know you both want a committed relationship with them? It's probably unrealistic to ask someone to make up their mind about you within only a few months of knowing you, but I'd like some feedback or tools on how to work with myself and prospective partners from a trauma-informed perspective.

For example, I've been dating this one guy right now for about a month and a half that I am sexually attracted to, he's taken me out on a couple of dates and I've met his friends, we've chatted a bit about the future and our values line up. He's attentive and always willing to see me and make plans, but I can't help but be suspicious of his hints at wanting sex and more physical closeness. I think this stems from a deeper fear of not being intimately loved for who I am but rather what I could provide with my body. In order to ""protect"" myself I feel this urge to tell him that I won't be intimate with him until we decide if we want to be a couple or not. Problem is, I'm not completely certain I want to pursue a long term relationship with him yet. I'm curious if there are other survivors who have ways of working through these feelings or how they cope/communicate, and/or people who are familiar with therapy that works with addressing this.

From what she's told me he was quite abusive and somewhat regularly left her with marks, bruises and even scars from knifes. 

She saw him in the street about a week after we started dating she saw him in the street and he started walking towards her looking extremely angry so she ran away from him. About a week later he called her and left an angry message about the fact she ran away from him (unsure of the exact wording as she didn't seem to want to talk about the call too much). She didn't respond and left the message unanswered.

Tonight she was visiting some old workmates at her old workplace and as she left and was walking to her car he confronted her. The impression I get is that he abused her verbally before proceeding to hit her and she ran off and escaped. She now has a black eye.

I've tried to convince her to go to the police but she keeps saying she doesn't want to. She's said that she'd feel like she was betraying a mutual friend they had a few years back who passed away (they had supported each other in the time following the friends death and that's kinda how they got together).

I've spoken to her to make sure she's alright, which she is for the most part, but I'm concerned for her and my ongoing safety. I feel like the only way she can be safe from this guy is to report him from the police.

I'm at a loss for what to do. Obviously I'll continue to support her with dealing with this, but I'm not sure what the best way is to support her with this and ideally get her to go to the police to get this piece of work behind bars before he hurts us or anyone else.

The main reason i came here is, yesterday I inserted my middle finger into my vagina. It didnt hurt or I didnt bleed but today when I looked at it I saw my hymen does not look the same before. I know how my hymen looked before because I used to observe it frequently while shaving. 
   In my country, hymen is still considered as the main symbol and proof of virginity and people care about it a lot. When a girl gets raped and killed, which happens a lot, some people even say those girls deserved death because they were not “virgins”. 
   I actually thought i was open minded and did not care about hymen. I still believe virginity is something that you can loose only with having any kind of sex with another person, but i cant stop my thoughts about what i did was something really bad because of the mentality of the people in my country. I know people will blame me for being a whore if they learn i broke my hymen. I know they wont believe me about the way it broke.

You told me your ride had bailed on you and you looked very upset. I know why you approached me. I look 'safe': someone in this sisterhood of women you could hopefully trust to take you where you had to go.

I'm so sorry for how I reacted. I froze and didn't know what to do. I didn't know who you were, and I could hear every adult I ever knew screaming in my head not to give a ride to strangers. You had a large purse; I didn't know what was in it. I wish I had asked you if you were safe and okay. I wish I had offered to call you an Uber, or to wait with you for a backup ride, or even the chance to use my phone to call for a ride. But I freaked out. The discomfort that comes from social norms being broken, plus that stranger-danger gut instinct, pushed me to leave. I gave some BS excuse and drove off. 

I cried in the parking lot when I got to my next destination. I felt so guilty for leaving you there, possibly having to ask another stranger for help, who wasn't 'safe' like me. I kept wondering how I would feel in your situation, where you felt you had to ask someone else for help. How you chose me because I didn't look threatening or dangerous.

I hate that I've been trained to consider requests from strangers as potential threats because of my sex. I hate that my lizard brain took over and I left you there.

I do consider my good friends to be like family, and obv my husband-to-be and two step-children. I am really struggling with the idea of having a traditional wedding since they are normally so family-oriented (E.g. father walking daughter down the aisle, first dance, the symbolism of uniting two families, etc). I don’t want to just forego having a nice wedding ceremony, but don’t really know how to have a wedding without my family there without being weird or sad, although the thought of me finally marrying my life-partner without them there already breaks my heart. 

So I figured I’d start here to look for ideas for getting through this. Like I said, I’d like to have a wedding because I want to celebrate with all the people I love, but I don’t want it to feel awkward, weird, sad, etc. 

Thanks for reading. Feel free to ask any other questions or point me to resources that might be helpful."|soooperdecent|False|https://redd.it/ekpgqo|0|0.5|0|12|1|twoxchromosomes

ekmfza|2020-01-06 01:19:24|PP medical abortion questions!|"On the verge of my 30th birthday, I've really been looking forward to this next chapter in my life. My ex and I share four beautiful girls, all under the age of 8, but unfortunately and very recently we separated. Though we are amicable, we need to focus on our own futures for the time being in order to secure better ones for our girls. (I have two classes left in order to graduate and he'll be re-enrolling in college in the fall.) Currently, me and all of the girls are living day-to-day in motels while he stays with an old college buddy as we are estranged from both of our families and have been since we started dating at the age of 16. 

Anyway, to the point. This weekend, I found out that we are pregnant again and I suspect I'm around 8 weeks along. Honestly, we can afford another child. We have no desire for another child. It's just not the right decision for us to keep this baby and we've both agreed that an abortion is the right thing for us. I run my own graphic design business and my ex is actively seeking employment, but the holiday season is always the slowest and if you've ever had to live in a motel, it's not cheap. I never thought I'd get one. And honestly, I'm really scared. Not because I'm second-guessing our decision, but because I have read that costs range from $650-950 for the two-pill medical abortion procedure. I'm barely making it as-is. He's barely making it as-is. In two weeks, we'll be able to collectively save $400. Will Planned Parenthood work with me? I'd it true they vary their pricing based on your income? If so, what is the least amount of money you've had to pay PP for a medical abortion? Unfortunately, I can't find a straight answer and I really need some peace of mind.

ekovyt|2020-01-06 04:36:26|A tale of being semi-assaulted from this weekend... I still don't know what to call it. I never actually said 'NO'. I really need to start making firmer boundaries as a woman... but why is making boundaries so hard as a woman?|"I met this drunk guy (Ryan) and his friend (Justin) last night at a sci fi convention this weekend. At first Ryan tried hooking me up with Justin, but Justin really just wanted to enjoy the convention. So then Ryan asked me if I wanted to hook up with him, and I was like 'eh, cool.""  


We made out in a corner for a while until he wanted to take a walk. He kept suggesting we walk over to his hotel (one of the nearby overflow hotels) and I kept saying that I literally only met him a half hour ago, so I didn't feel comfortable doing that. He kept saying okay, but would ask/beg/argue that it would be more comfortable/less crowded/more ""dark side Sith-like"" if we went back to his hotel. I kept saying no.  


He was holding my hand the whole time and had an arm slung over my shoulders tightly (I thought it was just 'I'm drunk and manhandling everything' at that point, but maybe not now). We decided to ""check out what the smokers were doing outside"" but once we were out there, he held my hand even tighter and started walking away from the smokers and across the parking lot towards the overflow hotels. I wrestled out of his grip and was like ""Oooookay, you're obviously NOT listening to me."" And I started walking back to the convention hotel.  


He caught up and was like ""Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, we can go walk around the convention some more for a bit if you're up to it.""  


And I gave him a pass because he was drunk so maybe I just needed to be more vocal, I guess. And I felt like a jerk for rejecting him so forcefully a moment ago.  


So we went to go find room parties. We got on an elevator and there were girls giving out jello shots. He told me I needed to drink one, so I decided I might as well. I drank about half of one of them (these were BIIIIG jello shots) and put the cap back on it. But then he started complaining that I wasn't drinking the whole thing. I pretended to drop it on the floor and was like ""oh, my bad.""  


We ended up finding a room party. It wasn't that crowded and the host gave us some vodka and sodas. Ryan was very adamant that I continue drinking. I mean, we were obviously there to do that because it was Saturday night at a con, but like geez. Then Ryan started like pawing at me in the middle of the party. He was like lifting up my skirt, putting his hand in my pants, biting me in a way that I might have liked if he wasn't setting off my predatory red flags. The host even said at one point, ""Enjoy yourself... as long as everything here is consensual?"" And kind of gave me side-eye.  


I was trying to figure out what I was feeling... as I literally was pulling Ryan's hands out of my pants and putting them on my knees. Like, he was cute and all... but just setting off soooooo many red flags. I dodged him and decided I wanted to check out what was happening on the balcony. So I went out there. He followed. And continued to paw at me as I leaned on the balcony. And I was watching all these people in the atrium enjoy the convention while my mind was screaming ""GET OFF ME!!"" but all I could do was just squirm and hope he got the message. My body language was screaming no, but he was drunk and I was kicking myself for being too polite to just verbally say ""Get off me!""  


Thankfully, my phone rang (wrong number), but I played it off as a friend who was at the convention was in trouble and I needed to go help her. I basically ran out like Cinderella on him, but he followed me down the hall and asked if he could come. And I spun around and was like, ""NO! I mean... no, no, I don't think she really needs strangers around her right now. She's really upset. I'll find you later, okay?""  


And I found the nearest elevator, kicking myself the whole time for making a scene and for not saying no out right when I wanted him to stop. More than being pawed at (because the guy was probably too tipsy to read between the lines), I'm just mad and feeling guilty myself because I couldn't verbalize the words ""Stop"" to a complete stranger. Like the feelings of a stranger were more important than my own body autonomy. And I was the one confusing the consent anyway, so it's mostly my fault. And the whole situation just confused the hell out of me. I mean, on the outside, it just looks like a cute boy wanted to have some fun at a convention, but on the inside, it just felt wrong.

So, I have a history of dating somewhat abusive men, who have always demanded whether explicitly or implicitly, that I cater to their every need. 


I’m currently in my first nurturing, healthy relationship. Only problem is he doesn’t take much care of himself. He has depression (so do I) but has spent much of his adult life ignoring it and just trying to make it through the day. 

I have a few other mental illnesses, but since I’ve gone to therapy and been disabled for much of my adult life, and have learned with many many ways to cope. 


It’s not that he isn’t interested in learning, but rather that he’s exhausted and tired all the time. 


He’s like a flightless bird. 

I don’t want to fall into that pattern of “helpless man, mothering girlfriend/partner/wife” 

We both want an equal relationship. 


How can I do my part in that? How can I recognize when I’m being too much? 

I can’t change him, and I don’t expect to. 
And if it would turn out that it absolutely doesn’t matter how I approach things, that he still doesn’t like.. write grocery lists or keep track of his own wallet and keys (etc etc) - and if I have absolutely no way to deal with the itch to “help” to make sure our lives run smoothly - then that’s okay and I’ll need to take a different path in life. 

But I want to do this, and I know I haven’t really tried, because I don’t even notice myself mothering him - and I don’t entirely know any other type of love. 

How can I take responsibility for my own actions? And not just... fall into something I don’t want to be?"|Zach-uh-ri-uh|False|https://redd.it/ekg0b5|7|0.81|0|12|1|twoxchromosomes

Except when I’m on my period. And it takes a huuuuge toll on me. It starts a couple of days before I get my period and I’m 90% sure it’s hormones that trigger it, and it’s like a switch flips - and has been consistently for like 6 months now (lasting the duration of my period). It triggers self-destructive habits of mine that are detrimental to my mental health, and that I can’t easily shake off. 

I also don’t cry very easily (at all), I’ve several times actually sat down and tried to force myself to but alas nothing happens. Yet today I spent my evening SOBBING while watching Avicii tributes and interviews - I’m laughing as I write this.

ekhhsc|2020-01-05 19:13:18|Been engaged for 3.5 years, can’t seem to plan a wedding|"I’ve been with my fiancé for 11 years. He is the love of my life and we’ve been living together in a house we purchased together for 2 years. When he proposed, I was a little upset initially because we hadn’t discussed getting married... but I realize now I just avoided the conversation because of my anxiety around the wedding itself, not being married. 

So fast forward 3.5 years and we still have no wedding planned. My list of people to invite has dwindled significantly due to friends moving away (too far to travel) which has really put a damper on things. So I say, let’s have a really small wedding. We put the list together and we keep removing more and more for fear of being too “awkward” for an intimate wedding. Now I’m just replaying our wedding in my head as being horrendous, and I’m stuck in this cycle of unbearable anxiety when I try to plan anything. 

Now my fiancé is working as a CPA and is essentially out of town constantly from January to April. Which leaves planning to me. Every year we say “next October” but without his input I’m completely lost. 

It doesn’t help that both of my sisters had extremely extravagant weddings, and my family expects something similar for us. And of course the expectation that it needs to be one of the best days of our lives.

ekjcpn|2020-01-05 21:30:44|I keep victimizing myself and I want to bash my head against a wall|"I talk in here a lot, but throwaway obvi. I don't know what to do or how to feel. I just want to cry. 

We met under someone weird circumstances. I was dating someone who was into cuckolding and both of us are bisexual (let's call this partner Riddler, he was a mystery) so he was looking for someone that he wanted me to play around with. , this caused everything to start under pressure because the Riddler had a habit of finding people for me to play around with ..... before telling me about it. It was ""a surprise."" And while I love threesomes and group sex, I'm a pretty private person so I like to have a meetup first. Get to know them. It led to many arguments. 

The Riddler and I have since broken up for other reasons but Thor and I are still friends. I use the friends word kind of nebulously because our conversations tend to stay pretty topical. For instance, while he's never said that he's anti-feminist he seems to get kind of touchy around those subjects. He once told me that he felt that a man who was attractive *couldn't* make a woman feel uncomfortable with sexual advances. it was more of a case of either a halo effect or the guy was socially inept and was unattractive something like that. He takes jokes a bit extreme, like when I express discomfort with the pickup artist community he will make a joke like ""what would you do if you walked in and there were pick up artist books all over my table?"" 

there have been times where he invites me over and I tell him I don't want sex. He tells me to come over anyway. Heathen precedes to get me naked generally was some weird no just take your shirt off we should just have skin-to-skin contact. I just want snuggles. But then he's kissing my neck. And then he has my hand on his cock. 

I keep going back to this even though I tell myself that I shouldn't or that I didn't want in the first place and it's not that great and I could have stayed home alone. But I like him and what if it's high sex drive? I can't fault that. but lately it feels like all of my interpersonal relationships outside of my familial ones are sexual and I feel really devalued. 

The other day I went over and he was almost pouting because we didn't have sex. It was fine at first but then he was kissing me and then he moved my hand to his dick and when I pulled away he scoffed at me. He said how we used to be thick as thieves and he doesn't understand ""we used to have it so good"". 

I said I had to go, and instead of the usual standing up to hug me and walk me out he just sat there and kind of ignored me. When I left he sent me a text message half an hour later saying that this was concerning. 

I've realized. This is a huge ingrained pattern and habit of mine. I've had other friends with benefits that are similar. I go over. I don't even get off. They don't give me emotional support. I just feel used.

ekg07a|2020-01-05 17:29:07|How do I know when I'll want kids?|"I'm 28, have been married for almost 3 years, and no idea how I should start planning this.

When I was in my early 20s, kids absolutely terrified me.  I swore I never wanted them, never found them cute, or the least bit interesting.  I never ""got"" that maternal feeling about them and now years later, I still don't.  However, we have some friends with young children that I genuinely do like and I'm not scared of them anymore.  I like to play and interact with them and I could see myself doing that with a child of my own someday.  I know I want to have a family with my husband and he would be a great dad.

However....I am now absolutely terrified of being pregnant, losing my body, and losing myself.  I don't want to gain weight and get made fun of for being ""fat."" I don't want pregnant jokes from my coworkers (I work with a lot of men).  Giving birth and actually HAVING the baby don't bother me, but the thought of having something grow inside of me for 9 months to achieve this is wild to me.  Will my body go back to ""normal"" after the baby is born?  Will I have a flat stomach again?  I have no health issues, in decent shape, and stay active.  I will find ""me"" again after a baby, right?  I travel a lot for work and I love it.  I also have a hobby that keeps me pretty busy on the weekends that I never want to give up.  Husband says he will support me 100% through both things and I don't have to stop my life just because we have kids.  It will change, but it doesn't just end as we know it.  I know these reasons are very selfish, but I think it's important to be honest.  I don't want to commit to something I will end up regretting.

I've made it clear to my husband I don't want to try for kids (we want 2) until my 30s, but I feel awful because he is ready now.  We both have great jobs, are financially secure, have our own home, great family support, etc..  He is absolutely wonderful to me and says I will still be ""me,"" even if I have a new identity as a mom. Bottom line is, I want to WANT to have a baby before we start trying.  I want being pregnant to be something I am happy about, not sucking up to do as a means to an end.  I 100% believe women were not put on earth to just be moms and reproduce, and my life can be about raising a family, but having my own interest and identities as well.

Will my mindset towards having a baby change as I get older?  I'm not stuck on any ""timeline"" or plan for our lives, but I want to know what I am signing myself up for.  I feel like I am in this weird in-between of, ""I want to have kids some day, but I don't want them right now and I don't want to grow one."""|Dunkero|False|https://redd.it/ekg07a|7|0.81|0|20|1|twoxchromosomes

eknuz6|2020-01-06 03:10:07|Long distance relationship, where does the distance end?|"So I [22F] have been dating my partner [22M] for a little over a year and a half (it will be 2 years in May). I live in Ohio and he lives in California. Our relationship has entirely been long distance (we met online). We have maintained the relationship with 3-10 day trips every 3-5 months to visit each other. 

He graduated from college last May and I am going to graduate this May. Before last May there were some conversations about him moving to me, but that was decided that it would work given that I didn’t want to stay in Ohio. We both agreed it would be unfair to him to find a job and move to Ohio when he would have to do the same thing again when I got my first job not in Ohio. 

So we decided last March that we would schedule a conversation in the future to talk and agree on a timeline for when the relationship would stop being long distance. We decided that it would be this December given that by then I would have a job and we have a bit of info regarding the immediate future. 

So we then had a mini convo last August and he mentioned that 1-2 years after my graduation would be a good time to make plans to move to each other. We also thought that it would be a bit better if we both moved to a city together, rather than one of us moving to the other. Based on this conversation, I was not worried about the official “future talk” that we had planned in December. 

So we just had the December future talk and it did not go anywhere close to what I thought. He started by saying that he was scared to commit to living in the same city 2 years from now when he has no idea where he will be career wise, which I understand. He also makes many comments about how he hates being long distance and he wants it to end. 

But the thing that I don’t agree with is that we will be 4 years long distance by this time and he is going to choose his career over me? I am not saying he needs to take a pay cut or get a job he’s not interested in just to be near me. All I am asking is that he thinks of me and includes me in his career decisions around that 2 year mark. I am also not saying that he should make the decision based on me, but I would appreciate it if he included me on his plans. Who knows, I could have the opportunity to relocated to 1/3 cities he’s looking into??? 

I am not really sure what to do. We had an exhaustive conversation about it that turned into a hypothetical game. I just don’t know if I am being unreasonable or if he is? or BOTH?

I was also thinking it could be due to (sorry if TMI) possible constipation because when I was at the worst of my flu (\~4 days ago) I was really dehydrated and I think didn't ""go"" for a day or two, but now I'm ""going"" again and the pain hasn't subsided.

It's a sort of dull pain that comes and goes, and I sometimes feel it as more of a tightness in my abdomen and sometimes as more of an ache in my back. If you get that PMS tight, bloated feeling, it's similar to that but radiates for a few seconds then goes away. I sometimes don't notice it for longer periods of time, but other times it happens every few minutes for 30-60 minutes.

I'm 21 and have never had a UTI before. The list of symptoms mentioned muscle aches and abdominal pains, but I haven't found any further descriptions of what it feels like so I'm not confident in matching it up. I'm not experiencing any other usual symptoms like burning, peeing more frequently than what's normal for me, itchiness, etc. I'm somewhat worried it could be a kidney thing that came up without a regular noticeable preliminary UTI.

eka0oc|2020-01-05 07:46:39|I had sex tonight that didn't go well and ended in me crying.|"I'm posting here because it's after 2am where I am and all of my friends are asleep, and I need someone to help me.

I [23f] commonly use dating apps for hookups. I'm home from graduate school, and while using them, I saw a really, really old family friend on two different apps [23m]. My younger sister was with me and jokingly said I should right swipe, so I did, and to my surprise, we ended up matching. We started talking like friends and laughing about how we're in touch again because of the apps. Long story short, we exchange numbers, text back and forth, and we talk about hanging out.

Tonight I invited him over to my place knowing that if he came over we would most likely hook up which I was 100% okay with. I've met up with my fair share of guys from apps, and one night stands aren't foreign to me at all.

Everything started off okay. When it got to the point where we were about to have penetrative sex, he kept trying to start it without a condom. Unfortunately this has been common with lots of guys I've slept with who start to put it in without asking or suggesting a condom. I said, ""Hold on, I'll grab a condom."" He gave the classic response I've heard way too often, ""Are you on birth control? We'll be okay,"" as if pregnancy is the only concern, not diseases. I said, ""Not that I don't trust you, but I don't know you don't have anything, so I want to use this."" This last month I went through a really extensive STD test and know I'm clean and really don't want to be worried about this because this last test was intrusive and emotionally exhausting. Anyway, he shrugged and said, ""Okay, your house, your rules,"" and put it on.

We proceeded to have some sex and took a break at one point. He took off the condom, and I was under the impression he had finished, so I assumed we were done for the night. He started initiating more which I was fine with until I felt him enter me without a condom. I froze because I couldn't believe he was disregarding my previous request so easily. I was shocked and didn't know what to do or say while he kept pumping away. He then moved from my vagina to my anus and forced his way in. I don't have much experience with anal sex, and he was fairly large, so this really scared me. I didn't want to do it. It hurt a lot, and he didn't use any lube. He just shoved it in. When I went to the bathroom after, I noticed a pink film that came from inside which I can only assume is blood.

As soon as he left, I burst into tears. I don't know why. I need help processing.

ekgbbn|2020-01-05 17:50:20|Losing Parts Of Myself And My Sanity|"Hey, y'all. I'm sure plenty of you know how it feels to temporarily or permanently lose parts of your femininity. I'm just at my breaking point. I'm scared. The next step of my very treatable cervical cancer, is a cone surgery, after already having had the LEEP and a chunk of my cervix removed. 



I feel defenseless. I've overcome things I didn't think I would, and this will be one of those, too. All of these procedures are wreaking havoc on my body, and my mind. I have a foot+ long  scar that runs from above my belly button to my mound. There's a 3"" scare to the left of that, from where I had a colostomy for nearly a year. Even if the bag was empty, the thought of sex was just fucking terrifying and gross. It took away a lot of how I had previously felt as a woman. 


There's so much more, but I know I'm lucky. I have the support. My husband is a fucking saint and my parents are too. 


Now, after a shit ton of other procedures and problems, another, bigger, issue has kicked me in the cunt.  So, yes, I'm infertile now. IVF should still be an option, but I have so much scar tissue, and from the cone surgery, women are known to miscarry at 20 weeks. I don't have the capability for that loss. Anyway, I'd like to foster. My husband and I would be good at it, and it would be very fulfilling. 


The missing part is the experience of being pregnant. It's just sad that I won't have that. I'll never know what it feels like, bad and good, to experience what women are made to do. Biologically, I should say. I respect people who know childfree is what they want. I just never thought I'd be childfree. 


Sorry for the rant, I'm scared and depressed; terrified of this next procedure."|brianpeppersgf|False|https://redd.it/ekgbbn|7|0.7|0|4|1|twoxchromosomes
ekn1pr|2020-01-06 02:05:57|How do I find a doctor and talk to them about anxiety medication?|"***Throwaway because despite being ""woke"" about mental health when it comes to literally everyone else, I've self-stigmatized myself about my anxiety to the point where I'm crying while typing this!***

I'm 25 now and I've been anxious as long as I can remember. Within the past 4 years I've started noticing my symptoms more and getting the sneaking suspicion that this isn't normal. I actually typed up a full 5 paragraphs about the things I do that I suspect aren't normal, and then I worried that maybe that's just me seeking validation, so I deleted them. So just assume that I'm a standard anxious person, and while I am what many would call ""high-functioning"" (ick) I think it does impact my life negatively. If it would be helpful to elaborate I'll do so in the comments.

I hate this. It's become such a huge part of my life and now I'm just so anxious whenever I think of how anxious I am and the prospect of living like this forever. It's the new year and I don't know, maybe I'm ready to see if medication can help. I know therapy is recommended along with medication but I don't know... I've tried changing my thought patterns and being mindful and all, and my dumb panicked brain just keeps freaking out anyway. I also have trouble relating to other people (I think it's because I spend so much time in my own head) so I'm worried that it just won't work on me... the few times I've tried to speak to school counselors it's just a very ""Oh... I see what Jedi mind trick you're pulling on me"" situation.

So here comes the actual problem. I've done my research. The next step for me should be, ""Go talk to your doctor about how you're feeling, and maybe they will prescribe you something that could help you be a normal person."" But here's the thing: I don't have a doctor. I have insurance (thanks Obama) but I just don't... go to the doctor? Or the dentist... or the eye doctor... I just didn't grow up in a family where that's a thing so I don't have a ""GP"" or ""regular doctor"" I go to. I'm a woman but I don't see the gyno or anything -- if I need birth control I use an app like Pill Club or Lemonaid. I'm no longer in school, or else I'd go to a campus health center or something. I also don't have anyone in my life I can ask to recommend a doctor either.

What do I do? Where do I find a doctor to go to? What kind of doctor is this? What kind of appointment do I set up? Just a regular checkup or will there be a box to check that indicates this? And what do I tell her? And how? Between her taking my weight and my blood pressure, do I just say ""oh and by the way, sometimes I think about dying?"" Will she think I'm just out here trying to get medication? I know that anxiety is talked about a lot more these days, and I look pretty young so I'm worried she'll think I'm just a kid trying to score some Xanax, I don't know. Predictably, my anxiety is keeping me from managing my anxiety! What do I do?!

***TL;DR: I'm anxious and I hate myself for it and because I'm useless I need a play-by-play on how to find a doctor and talk to her about it so I can get medication to help me feel normal or at least not terrible!***"|anxiousaf-throwaway|False|https://redd.it/ekn1pr|0|0.5|0|7|1|twoxchromosomes

ekir32|2020-01-05 20:40:31|I’m at a loss|"Hello all,

I’ve been a long time lurker and love being a part of this sub. The support and love for other women is something I wish we saw in the non internet world more often, but I believe it is becoming more prevalent everyday! 

I’m needing some help with my fiancé. Some background I’m (24F) and he’s (24M) we’re high school sweethearts and have been engaged for about 6 months. I also started a new program for school (student teaching) which requires me to intern unpaid ~50 hours/week if you include homework. I also work on the weekend to try and earn cash as a waitress but the restaurant has overhired and now I’m lucky if I can bring home $200/week from that side gig. 

This has put a ton of pressure on my fiancé to help support our household. He’s been incredibly supportive of me and I think he’s finally reached his breaking point of how much stress he can handle. He’s started becoming frustrated with our situation; financial, sexually (we’re both stressed so we don’t have sex as often as we used to), and we work opposite hours so we’re lucky to see each other for 2 hours when he gets home from work and then I have to head to bed. 

He’s seeing a therapist in a few days but it is not covered by insurance so he’s worried that one session is all we can afford and then he’ll have to figure other things out. 

I feel like I’m losing him to his own mind and I’m not sure how I can help. I’m under so much stress with my program with my students and making sure I’ll get my license and a job come august. I’m feeling like we’re both spread so thin and that we both can’t rely on each other for emotional support. 


The things we’ve tried so far:

Chore lists (he forgets after the first day) 

Scheduled date night (family and other obligations got in the way) 

Sex three times a week (opposite schedules lead to me falling asleep on the couch waiting for him to come home and then he knows I wake up at 5 am so he doesn’t disturb me) 

Every stressful conversation has led to both of us feeling more anxiety ridden and more confused about the best outcome 

I’m trying so hard to make time for him but it just doesn’t feel like enough and I know he tries so hard to make me happy but he’s not happy himself anymore and I don’t know what to do.

ekj2aj|2020-01-05 21:02:20|When I Was 12, a 17 Year Old “Dated” Me.|"hey all. i’m pretty nervous to be posting this as it’s been one of my very unfortunate life situations.

when i was 12, a 17 year old “dated” me.

it’s been 4 years since this happened, so i’m not too bright on details, but i can remember a good portion of it.

we had met over a game on steam. i was an admin on a specific server (due to some very dumb choices) and for some reason we grew closer together. i can’t remember much during our friendship, but when he “asked me out” is where it all really comes back to me.

the most recent memory i have during this time is when he said “i love you” to me during a session in the same game we had met. i was messing around, abusing my admin powers, and having a half-decent anxiety riddled time. i don’t remember if i said anything similar back, but i know i laughed awkwardly, my hands sweaty, my heart pounding with anxiety. a vivid memory.

the next memory i have is something during & after our “relationship.” i explicitly remember him sending a dick pic. i think he asked for nudes too. i also think that he asked me to do sexual favors (using pens for masturbation). the memory regarding after, he sent me a video of him in tears at his computer desk, showing a magazine full of bullets, putting the barrel in his mouth, and ending the video. he did not commit suicide.

during this time, he was also apparently “cheating” on me with 4 other girls. we “broke up” because of it. i did come back eventually and we “dated” for some more time before i found out he was, yet again, “cheating” on me with, again, 4 other girls. at that point, i only hated him. i was 13.

now, i’m not the blameless victim here either. i do remember harassing him constantly *only* for the fact that he had “cheated” on me, not because he was 5 years older, or asking explicit things, or sending me a video through skype of an attempt of emotional manipulation. i do blame myself.

the worst part about it is that he did say “i could get in trouble for this.” i remember asking “why?” he told me “it’s because of our age difference.” i don’t remember my reply, but i am sure i assured him it would be okay.

however, not only do i hate him, but i also heavily dislike my parents for this ever happening. if they had been more strict with my internet choices when i was younger, it could’ve been so much simpler and safer for my young mind. it just seemed to be disregarded, i guess.

if you’re a parent, please be more strict on social media until your child is of able understanding to protect themselves against nasty people. it’s changed who i am in a drastic way and my childhood was very much ruined."|mindlesschild12|False|https://redd.it/ekj2aj|0|0.5|0|2|1|twoxchromosomes

I posted earlier about my dad being supportive.
he definitely is more supportive than my mom in regards to word uses but let's my mom run over him. I've showed them pictures of the rape kit from the first time and they now have settled on not believing me. mind you they dont know how many times this occurred.

but this break they invited him over after working hard with therapy and finally getting myself to not feel continuously manipulated into going over to help him and his ex wife (who knows that I got raped by him and wanted me to go make sure her son was ok with him. wtf) in regards to his daughter and son. this of course resulted in me being raped multiple times if that's what you want to call it. I feel like it set me back a million years. but to them it was fine because ""I wasnt alone with him"" and ""they're watching me""

sure ok. lol. hilarious. funny.

this is why I got into the situation I'm in now to begin with. I told them when I was younger he molested and beat me multiple times when he lived with me. and they didnt believe me because I waited to tell them and they didnt see it happen

So I started birth control when I was 18 and took it continuously for over a year unknowingly (thought I was taking sugar pills and I never was. No one explained that I had to take a break between each package of pills I just assumed I had sugar pills. It was stupid and I should’ve payed more attention. I thought my period was happening every three months or so because I would get some brown discharge). I brought it up to my doctor at my physical yesterday and she told me it was fine and that there’s actually no medical reason that you have to have a period unless you’re trying to get pregnant. She also told me that women with IUDs dont get their period for 5 years which I had no fucking idea that was the case. So I decided that I’m going to have my period every three months rather than every month. I’m just disappointed that I’m almost 20 and I never learned this about my body.

ekfda5|2020-01-05 16:43:51|About my sexual relationship with my boyfriend (and my friends opinion about it)|"Hello,

Yesterday i was drinking with my friends (girl group) we were at at a friends house and after some drinks we got chatty about sexual things and so on. Everyone  told  something about  their boyfriend or husband for some of us.  After I told the following my friends got a litlle more serious asked if i am ok with this relationship but after a few minutes and me telling them i am ok. we changed to different subjects.  Today one of these friends wrote me that she is concerned  about me. witch got me thinking. Also they told me that this is most guys dream. No i am not writing a guys dream. 

Bassicly what i told them: I like pleasing my boyfriend sexually and please him when he wants it. Sometimes he asks. But mostly I initiate going down on him. I do more than just get him off and take a long time before he cums.( i went into more detail yesterday) I also like cum but not in a physsical kind but as a sign of knowing he liked what i did.  I do really like what i am doing and it turns me on pleasing him. (Not as excessive as i maybe described it yesterday) 

Especially  the last two things got my friends concerned.

Side facts that may be relevant for this or some answers from questions my friends asked.
- We not rarely have regular sex but in comparison  to me pleasing him you could say it is rare. 
- he told me what he likes so I know what to do. Or at least showed me porn of what he likes (I asked for this because he couldnt really explain)
- it is only in private, yesterday was the first situation I mentioned our sexual life that detailed to someone
- I (24) he (25) together for 3 years now.  This started 2 years ago.
- its not rough at all I am the most active part.
-not native english speaker. So sry if this is a mess.
-throw away account

 Questions:
I have no problems with anything but as my friends thing otherwise i want more opinions.
Is this kind of sexual relationship that unusual?

excuse the grammar ahead of time
also so sorry if this isnt the right place to post this or if itd be more fitting to post in a different subreddit. I usually browse and dont post so I'm not really sure how this goes

2019 was been a shit show

- got raped multiple times by a cousin 

- cousin still in contact with me

- told my parents about the rape as a singular event and they responded extremely poorly (my fault, whore, cousin fucker, I wanted it, I deserve it) and still have him around me

- caught my mom cheating on my dad (hence the divorce)

- almost failed out of nursing school but didnt but lost my scholarship due to my gpa hitting the floor for a C

- new years was shitty 

- parents getting a divorce and throwing me in the middle of it and they're so on again off again

- grandma moved in with parents and constantly calling me having breakdowns over it. granted I'd have breakdowns too if I lived with my parents right now too

- lost a few friends due to me not reporting the rape granted I can see how they feel helpless so I've moved to trying not to talk to people about this stuff and rely on my counselors for that

- gained 20 pounds 

- mom encouraging ED behaviors since weight gain

- mom telling me she wishes she never had me

- had a friend commit suicide 

- shitty roommate situation which thankfully I manage to avoid the conflict but the tension is exhausting 

and now I'm just fed up. 
I've relapsed completely with my bulimia and cutting. flashbacks are out the wazoo and I feel like 75% of my day is me panicking unless I'm binging, purging or cutting. and at this point I'm so exhausted from trying to fight coping like this and feeling like shit on top of shit every day. I'm just so overwhelmed and I feel like nothing is going to ever get better. and if continuoully getting abused is what is in my future then I dont care. I feel so disgusting. even now I feel like I can't breathe properly because i feel like hes here

and I'm trying not to give up solely on the basis of my counselors being super supportive and motivating me but jesus this is so hard

I feel so broken and like damaged goods and like I'll never feel whole again
I dont even recognize myself spiritually, mentally or physically even more

I feel like every part of me has been destroyed and I'm just tired

ek8vgp|2020-01-05 05:45:17|Masturbation—for health, wellbeing, and of course, pleasure.|"There are plenty of reminders everywhere to be sexually positive and masturbation has certainly become a normal thing to talk about in the recent years. But I know the hesitation still exists, for a lot of us, masturbation was a taboo, something to be ashamed of and in a lot of cases, never even addressed as a thing. As a result—you either masturbate with some guilt or never even bother/dare to. And all this generally ends up with a woman who doesn’t know her body. Of course there are many body and sex positive women today rocking that clitoris away, but we have to acknowledge that there’s still a certain number of women who’re missing out on the beautiful experience of sexual liberation. 

In my personal experience, I had always been masturbating (I was a weird kid) but never really knew what it was. I just remember feeling guilty that I did it. But I did it anyway. And then eighth grade came and I discovered porn. And THEN I was like ohhhhh this is totally normal. It wasn’t much until recently (like one and half years) ago that I started to...explore myself more. And holy cow. Unfortunately no man or woman has given me a completely mind blowing orgasm. They’ve been close but I’m a pretty anxious person and I’m more busy thinking about how I’m performing (I know that’s not good and I’m working on it) but then again I have sex with kind of strangers so there’s that part of chemistry missing. Anyway, so far only masturbation (and almost exclusively clitoral but sometimes anal) has given me actual orgasms. Like I wouldn’t be able to hear shit for a second or two and I’ll be blissed out (and dehydrated). 

Masturbating allows you to have control over yourself and your own pleasure. And no one knows how to pleasure yourself better than you would! No more guys hitting your clitoris like it’s an emergency stop button, no more 5-minute sessions, no more tiny dick slipping out. 
It’s fun and it’s liberating and makes you feel like a goddess plus there’s apps like dipsea and so that have female oriented audio-porn. Which is so cool though I haven’t tried them personally. 

Plus, masturbation kind of really helps me through my depression. There’s the initial release of endorphins that are definitely welcome, then there’s the afterglow, the feeling that wow I’m a sexual goddess who’s breaking societal norms hooray! And helps me break the cycle of depression, of stagnancy in my mind. And it’s been scientifically researched and proven that orgasms are good for your physical and mental health—providing more vitality to both. 

So if you’re hesitant about it, or just someone who considers themselves generally not living up to their full sexual potential, maybe try touching yourself. Really. For many it can be a hard step to take, or maybe you just never cared much for sex or do not consider yourself a sexual person—and of course there’s no pressure to enjoy sex and it’s your body and if you’re not comfortable doing anything sexual, you’re of course entitled to that, BUT there is a chance that maybe that’s something you haven’t given a fair chance. 

That’s all I wanted to say, it’s a ramble and I’m sorry for that, but I just want to encourage more women to explore themselves because I only recently discovered myself sexually and want other women to feel that way as well!"|bourbon_and_icecream|False|https://redd.it/ek8vgp|14|0.78|0|4|1|twoxchromosomes

So when I became a senior, my nanna made it clear that I could have any prom dress, regardless of price or country. All I had to do is point and it was mine. My sisters dress came all the way from China. 

I, however, didn't see the need to cost my nanna hundreds for a dress. But my school mentioned a thing called Cinderella's Closest, that would give you a free dress, shoes, and other things. It was several hours away, But my friend wanted a free dress too so her mom drove both of us to the place. 

I walked in and it was huge room filled with girls, moms, food, drink and Tangled was playing. We were the last to arrive and my friend was immediately taken to the back to pick out a dress. I hung out until a lady walked in and asked if everyone had a dress. I told her I didn't. 

She stared at me, grabbed a radio and yelled ""I have one more Cinderella! I repeat one more Cinderella! Do I have any fairy godmothers available?"" She smiled and told me that I would have a fairy godmother soon. 

My fairy godmother showed up and introduced herself as Holly. We went and spend around a hour finding me the prefect dress. Even other fairy godmothers got in on it. 

We were about to leave with our dresses, and such when were stopped and given a bag. Inside was a hand written note from my fairy godmother saying she had so much fun helping me pick out my dress, how beautiful I looked and how she hoped I had a wonderful time at prom. (I still have the note). 

The day of my prom, my aunt did my hair and kept asking to do my makeup. I really really don't make up and never wear it. I kept telling her ""no"". After we were done, and in her car, she asked one more time and I finally said "" Yes"". She let out a squeal of joy and immediately drove me to get house to do my make up. 

I went home after it and put the whole thing together. My sisters kept telling how beautiful I looked and my nanna was beaming with pride as she  took my pictures. 

Prom was so much fun. I didn't have a date, but that didn't matter. I just danced with my friends and had a blast. Even the after prom was amazing. And my nanna even woke up at 3 am just to make sure I had fun and was home safe. The next morning I told her all about it, and she was so happy I had fun.

i’ve always been more masculine and dressed more masculine, and sometimes i switch between dressing more masculine and then putting some makeup on etc, and i’ve noticed i could go out two nights in a row wearing pretty much the same outfit but if i’ve styled my hair and done my makeup more feminine men in general are way more disrespectful to a dangerous level. i’m still the same person, and even in the first instance i’m dressed up and pretty much the same level of attractiveness but you throw on some eyeliner and a skirt and looks off men/ subtle touching, the hands on you while trying to move past, is a LOT more apparent. the reason why this is such a big thing for me is that obviously i knew it happened, ive seen it with my friends and other girls constantly but until i tried to be a little bit more feminine i’d never realised quite how objectified feminine presenting women are? 

obviously this is someone all women face to an extent, ive been assaulted and harassed etc when more masc in the past, but the stereotypes that come with looking. little bit more femme is both astounding and horrifying.

I'm 19 (if that helps in anyway). I recently got prescribed birth control (specifically Estelle-35) for my painful periods and acne and I've been taking it for 3 weeks. It was on this third week that I noticed I was experiencing severe intrusive thoughts and anxiety about things I've never had anxiety about. The intrusive thoughts are horrible and always feel like they are stuck in the back of my mind and play for days and I get very dramatic and worked up about them and cry. It sort of feels like my mind is going crazy but another part of my head is rational and knows I don't believe those things/want them/I am not that. I have depression but I've never felt like this before  and never had anxiety to this extent at all but now it is hard to sleep even when I take melatonin, I'm anxious to work and be around people etc. 

I stopped about 5 days ago, started my period (which is intensely painful more so than before) and am feeling a bit more like my normal self. I'm wondering: has anyone else experienced this anxiety/ocd/intrusive thoughts with birth control? How long did it take for you to feel better again? Sorry if this is all too much I'd just love to know if anyone else has experienced this.

Most of my life, I’ve had long hair. The one time I cut it was in the 5th grade. Short hair was “In style” so I decided to cut it down to shoulder length. Without the weight of the rest of my hair weighing it down, the top of my head became a giant, red cotton ball. I looked like a clown, with hair sticking out to the sides. Since then, I’ve let my hair grow out longer than it’s ever been, and I hate it.

My long hair is getting increasingly more annoying. I wake up with my hair around my neck, limiting my breathing. I’ve been spending all my money on shampoo and conditioner because I use a quarter of a bottle of the stuff per hair wash (shower every day but limit hair washing to once per week because it gets too expensive otherwise), and every morning it’s a battle between myself and my comb. I am in pain trying to untangle the bird’s nest that forms on my head every night. So last night, I made an appointment to have it cut.

I need advice. I want my short hair but I don’t want to go through the hell that was 5th grade fuzz-ball hair. How can I make my hair manageable without it fluffing up into a neck cushion? I have to be at work by 5:45 every morning so waking up early and straightening it every morning would leave me a walking zombie. Besides it’s probably not great for my hair in the long run.

ekeou5|2020-01-05 15:54:10|3/4th of snow entire factory banded together to protect me from a creeper.|"The way the factory was set up was there was a huge room where 3 lines ran next to each other. There were 4 lines total but the 4th one was all the way across the factory. 

I mainly worked the 3rd line but had friends on the second and first lines as I would sometimes work them. I was 22 when I noticed this old man, around 70 had dropped some boxes off his pallet. So I along with several other went to help. He thanked me and I smiled and said no problem. And that's all it took for him to fall madly in love with me. 

This dude kept trying to touch me, get me on his car, spend my lunch break with him, tell him where I lived, my phone number, and to go out on a date with him. I had zero idea that was he was doing was sexual harassment. I'd never encountered this before and I was scared. 

The people I worked with, ladies especially, decided to take matters into their own hands and found out he would only leave me alone if he saw another man near me. So the second they saw him trying to talk to me, they would immediately run and get a male worker, who come running to my aid. If they couldn't get a male to come help, then I had their permission to run to a guy or another line and they would protect me. 

One day I was off, and he decided to go up to one friends on another line and whine about me. ""Why does she run from me? Why doesn't she want to talk to me? Why doesn't she go out with me? Do you know where she lives? Can you tell me where she lives? Can you give me her phone number? Can you get her to go out with me?"" 

This was the final straw for her. It was well-known I walked home from the factory at night, in the dark and she was terrified he would follow me home or even try to kidnap me. She ran straight to a supervisor and told him everything. He told he would deal with it. 

I was never called in or anything, but the guy was suspended for about 3 months, and moved to a different part of the factory and different shift so that he couldn't have any contact with me."|Bluellan|False|https://redd.it/ekeou5|0|0.44|0|2|1|twoxchromosomes

The hotel Pambos Napa Rocks in Ayia Napa, Cyprus seems to have a long history with bad security and careless workers.

Weeks before the more famous Ayia Napa Rape where  a young British woman was allegedly gang-raped, victim of revenge porn and intimidated into withdrawing her accusation without a lawyer, and then charged with ""public mischief"", there was another woman:

This woman was also raped in the hotel, but when she reported the case, the workers didn't care, arguing that ""it didn't concern them"". 

This sort of problems seem to be very common in Cyprus, and many women in the country have long been protesting the broken legal system and medieval attitudes of some of the men in the country which has the lowest rape conviction rate of Europe."|MandrakeThePancake|False|https://redd.it/ejveaj|93|0.89|0|12|1|twoxchromosomes

When I was 12-13 years old, I went to a summer camp. The owner of the camp used to teach swimming. He only used to teach swimming to girls and his (male) assistant would teach the boys. (Boys and girls were given different pools).


The thing is, he was a middle aged man and there was something so off about him. He would teach us to float on our backs. I vividly remember, he kept one of his hands under my butt and the other hand pinched my vagina. I didn't know what to feel. It hurt but at that time I had no knowledge. No sex Ed, no good touch/bad touch lecture from my parents.


And now, I feel so anxious about it. I'm so uncomfortable and I don't know what I should do. I know he did something wrong but it didn't feel that way at the time. It's only in the recent months that I've realized that it was abuse. I can't talk about it to anyone, I'm too ashamed. 


Will this uncomfortable feeling eventually pass? How do I get over it? What should I do? Can this incident be the reason as to why I'm so confused about my sexuality?

ek7tce|2020-01-05 04:10:16|I don't know what I want|"I am 23. I started having sex when I was 22. But it has always been casual sex. Sex with 'friends with benefits'. I've never been able to date anyone I liked, anyone I have cared about. And I don't know why that is. 
Coming back to the casual sex. I'm in India, and I have friends who have managed to get into serious relationships with people they met on Tinder, so I thought I'd give it a try. And I met a whole bunch of guys, some smart but creepy, some stupid but nice, some willing to commit, some not. I ended up losing my virginity to a guy who did not want to commit to a relationship. It was good fun though. He was smart and funny, and we had great chemistry in the bedroom. I had the best sex of my life with him. But soon after we started having sex, the dates stopped. Completely. I realise now that having casual sex with someone doesn't entitle you to hanging out without sex. 
Anyways, the lack of hanging out made me hate myself. So I went and had more sex. Drunk sex. Sex with people I should not have had sex with. I was close to ruining good friendships. I just wanted to sit in a corner and cry and cry. 
So I got therapy, and I stopped. It was about loving myself. I don't need validation from someone willing to have sex with me. I thought I would wait for a guy who really appreciates me to give me the stability, love and respect I deserve. 

And then came along a guy I've known and in some weird way admired for 7 years now. We were in college together. We were great friends in the starting, and then he dated my roommate (I didn't know that when they were dating), and he got his heart broken by her. He started smoking pot a lot, and I worried for him, so maybe I nagged too much. And then he decided he hates me. I still don't know why. We have spoken about it (while drunk) and he said the he didn't like the way my thoughts manifested. I don't know what to make of that. 
So he came to the city, and hit me up after not talking to me for almost 2 years, and I went running like a puppy. And we got drunk, and had sex. It didn't feel like fucking though, he held me, he made me feel special. I thought we could have a relationship. 2 weeks later, he tells me he couldn't. I forgave him after a week and asked if he'd be interested in casual sex. He said yes. We were supposed to meet last night, but he cancelled last minute. And I need the strength to give up on him finally. 

Amidst all this drama, I am doing good things with my career. I am being responsible. I am achieving things. And so I justify that some stupid drunk casual sex is not a big deal. 

I don't know what to do. I'm sure no one will see this post, but it feels good to put it down. If someone has reached till here, I'm sorry for the long post."|praisebe10|False|https://redd.it/ek7tce|4|0.67|0|2|1|twoxchromosomes

So my cycle is usually 30-31 days long--my last first day of period was on Nov 30, 2019 and I ovulate around probably on Nov 11 to 17? Around that week. But I saw ovulation mucus around Nov 16 to 20. 

The thing is, my SO and I had sex on Nov 9 and 10, days before my ovulation. First, he had a few penetrated strokes without condom and he ejaculated inside the condom afterwards. On Nov 10, he had washed and peed by then before penetrating for a couple of seconds before wearing a condom. 

But currently--I'm 5 days late. I had a few late period as well but I've never been 5 days late. I'm thinking that my weight gain and the change of the way I'm eating have to do something with this. The last time I had period before November, I was thin, due to stress and anxiety. But then I got better and I began to eat more and more, ate lots of snacks during midnight and shit like that.

I opened it, expecting something innocuous, but the first message said ""would it be weird if we saw each other naked?""

I was taken aback, but not totally surprised, since this dude had once texted me once while wasted and asked if there would have been something between us had I not dated his brother. At the time,  I replied that his brother meant a lot to me so I couldnt even think about answering his question. 

So after reading this message,  I responded ""are you drunk? Why would you ask me that?"" His response was ""why wouldnt i..."" and I said ""I'm gonna go with weird"". At this point he just responded with an ok and I thought it was over. 

Then he sent another message that said ""I'd eat you'r ass"" (typo included) to which I responded ""why would you say that?"" (Stupid, I know). He said ""because i want to hump you"". I'm blown away at this point and just say im out and put my phone down. 30 minutes later I see a ""no worries"" message. 

I feel super anxious and grossed out. I never mentioned that I have a boyfriend because it's not his business yet somehow I feel guilty for that. I haven't seen this person in years. I feel like he will probably message me when he's sober apologizing because that's what he did last time he sent me an inappropriate drunk text a year or so ago.

She will be sentenced the 7th of January, and given reddits hard-on for just reading headlines, it's worth clarifying some information and busting some myths about the case.

The article shortened as much as possible:

\- The woman, 18 at the time, had consentual sex with a guy she'd met. 

\- However, his buddies show up and break into the room. They then allegedly rape her. They also release revenge porn of her to the press.

\- The police deny her access to a lawyer or a translator, and interrogate her for eight hours. They intimidate her to retract her accusation, threatening to detain her friends, while conveniently not recording the interrogation as European law dictates. 

\- Her ""confession"" turns out to be written by someone else who is obviously not a native English speaker.

\- They then use the retraction and confession as ""evidence of her lying"". The judge refuses to allow her evidence at court on the grounds of her retraction, while he refuses to accept that the confession isn't her words and obtained under duress. He then convicts her of ""public mischief"".

Again, I cannot stress this out enough: 18 year old in a foreign country, no lawyer, no witnesses, no translator, poor police work, a fake confession and a sham trial were she isn't allowed to present her evidence. The case is such a travesty that the UK foreign office has gotten involved.

And some more info:

Contrary to popular belief on the internet, there is no video of her having consentual sex with multiple men. The video the internet used as evidence was four years old.

The only footage available shows her having sex with one guy, which conveniently stops the moment his friends break in the room. 

Yes, women can make false rape accusations. But anyone who's bothered to read more than just reddit headlines on this case can clearly see that this isn't one of them."|MandrakeThePancake|False|https://redd.it/ejl9w5|747|0.94|1|103|1|twoxchromosomes

He's just very clumsy). My landlord noticed, and informed me that we would have to pay to fix it, and he would send someone out. Fine. Whatever. Now keep in mind, my landlord has my husband's number, but he basically knows to just contact me. I'm the one on top of these things because my husband has two jobs.

Yesterday, the repairman came out and I decided to just work from home so that I could let him in and out. He worked for several hours, asking me a couple questions, and then left. He came back later in the afternoon, at which point my husband was home, so I left to go into my office for a bit. My husband said he left after like 5 minutes (I guess just needed to look at the wall?), shook his hand, and said he would be back tomorrow morning. In total, my husband has said probably two words to the guy.

Now it is tomorrow morning! I dropped my husband off at work, went home, and greeted the repairman. After he was finished, he called me over, and we had the following conversation

Repairman: Is your boyfriend home?

Me: No, he's at work.

Repairman: Well when he gets home, tell him he needs to sand down this patch before you paint it.

At which point I emphasized that I would be the one sanding it, thanked him for the work, and he left. No handshake, of course. I was nice, but what I wanted to say was something like ""Hey man, I'm literally a scientist? I think can figure out sandpaper.""

The funny part to me is that my husband, while I love him to pieces, is completely inept at fixing things.

ek3spb|2020-01-04 22:43:02|Epic gun fail|"So my husband travels a lot and said he would feel better if I had a gun to protect myself.  Unfortunately I have been a victim of gun violence in the past so I have a legitimate phobia of guns. I have fired a few with friends over a span of several years, each time no better than the last due to my crippling anxiety. My hands still shake to this day. 

I did some research on overcoming a fear of guns and one of the tips were to let the instructor know that I have been affected by a traumatic incident. ""This will help your instructor be prepared to appropriately deal with your specific needs during class and be prepared for your physical and psychological reactions.""

So I figured I'd give it another shot. I walk into a gun shop / gun range and immediately have this rush of fear come over me. I'm about to leave but the guy behind the counter asks if I need any help, we'll call him Bob. There was a kindness in his voice so I turned around and told him I was a first time gun buyer and about my phobia. He was extremely helpful and gave me great information. I actually found a gun I was comfortable holding and felt I could use given my very limited experience, a 9mm. Before I purchase the gun, I ask to try it out in their range. He says ""Of course!"" and walks me to the range to meet the instructor, let's call him Jim. This is when everything goes to crap.

First thing Jim asks is ""Have you ever shot a gun before?"" I tell him no because I want to learn everything I can and then tell him I'm a beginner and gave him a heads up that I'm scared of them. Next he asks ""Which gun were you looking to buy?"" I told him the 9mm. He proceeds to scoff and roll his eyes at me bc ""They are all 9mm hun. I'll ask Bob."" He leaves and comes back saying ""It's a G2C 9mm. I'll show you how to load the CLIP, don't call it a magazine, it's a CLIP!""  He shows me, then tells me to do it. I guess I was too slow loading the clip so he was like ""Ok we're not spending all day doing this."" By this time my anxiety is starting to resurface bc if I can't even load a clip properly, surely I will find some way to mess it up. He puts everything together then shows me how to stand, where to put my thumbs, etc. As soon as he handed me the gun, my hand starts shaking. He said ""You look scared."" I told him I was. He told me that unless I stopped being scared he couldn't let me shoot bc I would be endangering myself and others. I could feel the heat rising into my chest, it would only be a matter of time before I started crying, so I thanked him for his time and walked out, without a gun. I cried in my truck for a minute, mostly from sheer embarrassment. At least the first half of my experience was a positive one. Baby steps. One day I hope to be brave enough to stop shaking whenever I hold a gun but for now I will have to settle for pepper spray lol.

The almost compulsory grading, rating, picking into little tiny pieces and body parts. Said out loud, as if it were normal, acceptable (well, I suppose it is seen as normal and acceptable)... it's almost a requirement to prove manhood.

ek8j7f|2020-01-05 05:13:44|What is your opinion on porn?|"I’m a woman and a feminist. Most feminists I’ve met are fine with porn but some aren’t. These people (usually women) think that porn reduces women to sex objects. Porn stars aren’t sex objects. They are people. But I don’t know what these feminists expect. It’s porn. People watch it to purely get off. It’s not the same thing as watching a movie. If it was, the acting wouldn’t be so bad. 

Some feminists also state that many women are raped in porn and/or are made to do things they don’t want to do. This is true and it’s awful and disgusting that this happens. That’s why you should be very careful (if you watch porn) with the porn you view. For example, maybe look for professionally made porn (instead of amateur) and porn created by certain directors so you can trust there’s no sexual coercion or assault going on. Or look on certain websites. Not all porn involves sexual assault and coercion.

Another reason that these feminists are against porn is because it can distort the way some people view sex and make them compare their partners to pornstars. However, this isn’t true for everyone. That’s like saying that no one should drink alcohol because some people become alcoholics.  

Also there is a solution to this problem: educating people by telling them that most porn is purely acting, that the pleasure experienced often isn’t real, and that many pornstars have romantic partners who they have sex differently with in private than they do with those who they make porn with. Schools should talk about this since there are kids that aren’t even teenagers yet that are watching porn (I personally think that’s WAYYY to young to watch porn but telling them not to watch it doesn’t really work) This could maybe decrease the amount of people who’s views of sex are distorted by porn. 

A couple other arguments I’ve seen these feminists put out there against porn is that porn can be addictive and no woman should have a career solely based on the her sex appeal. 

First of all, anything can be addictive. Even fast food. Does that mean we should get rid of McDonald’s and Burger King? Just because some people may be addicted to porn doesn’t mean the whole industry has to go away. Most porn watchers aren’t addicted to porn and have a healthy relationship with it.

Second of all, who cares if a woman wants a career based on her sex appeal? She’s not hurting anyone by doing this. She’s not saying that all women must have careers based on their sex appeal. One belief of feminism is that we should empower women to make their own choices as long as it’s not hurting anyone.

Also I wish women watching porn wasn’t so taboo. We already have to hear from society that we shouldn’t be too “out there” (if you get what I mean) about our sexuality. We’re also told that male sexuality is seen is ok, but parts of female sexuality need to be repressed. And then we have feminists telling other feminists who watch porn that what they are doing makes them not a feminist. 

It really shouldn’t be a big deal as long as they have a healthy relationship with porn and are careful about the porn they view to ensure there is no sexual assault or coercion.

What are your thoughts on this topic? I’m open to all points of view here.

Edit: I want to clarify that I do not support kids watching porn. I think that only adults should watch porn. 

Edit #2: I also want to clarify that if you’re not into porn, that’s fine. There’s a difference between not being interested in something and being against it."|swimlover99|False|https://redd.it/ek8j7f|0|0.55|0|56|1|twoxchromosomes

My qualm here is with organized religion pushing misogynistic political ideals. I'm also generalizing: I realize that there's an exception to every rule, and perhaps not *all* churches push politics.

I think it's crazy that there are churches preaching ""pro-life""/anti-abortion. To my knowledge, no bible says anything specifically about abortion being murder. It's something that's strongly subject to debate and I don't think preaching it factually in a religious context makes it a religious matter. It makes you a political organization instead of a religious one, at the very least.

Even if we could all agree that abortion is in fact murder, I've never personally heard a church group pray to end capitol punishment.

And preaching ""pro-life"" to children who are too young to understand the matter is its own category of wrong. If you don't want your children to have an abortion, fantastic -- teach them how to avoid it. 

But this crazy political/patriarchal agenda thinly disguised as religion? That's different. Having children ""pray for the souls of aborted babies"" in church should be considered borderline religious abuse. \[end rant\]"|SanguineSushi|False|https://redd.it/ekamp2|0|0.46|0|23|1|twoxchromosomes
ejxz7y|2020-01-04 15:32:18|I feel like my (lack of) sex drive is slowly killing my relationship|"I've (21F) been in a steady relationship for more than three years. We're planning on moving in together in September. I love cuddling, love being close to him (although sometimes I wonder if it's ""true love"", because I have no prior experience, so I don't know how to tell). All in all, he's important to me. But when it comes to sex, 90% of the time I just don't feel like doing it. I find it really difficult to get aroused, and just generally value cuddling more. 

Most of the time when we do it, it hurts at the beginning, which usually doesn't last for more than a minute, but I still wonder if it's normal. I know that pain is not normal during sex, but here's some backstory: 

1) My discharge is (I believe) more than normal. It's not too terrible, but I feel so disgusting that it's like this. I've been to the gynecologist with it, nothing is out of order, so it's really just me.

2) We had a period (at around one year into the relationship) when it was amazing, we had regular sex, and it didn't hurt at all. But then...

3) I'm very susceptible to infections, and at around that time, I started getting them regularly. I got it like 3 or 4 times that year. Needless to say, our sex life completely vanished because of it, I was in constant fear of getting it again, and just generally felt disgusting. 

4) I got through that and I've been healthy since, but we enrolled in university, which leaves no time and no private life for us (and when we get some alone time I'm too tired).

5) I don't know if it's relevant, but my first gynecologist encounter was terrible (I was a virgin at the time, he didn't ask, I didn't know I had to explicitly tell, so it resulted in pain, fainting and crying).

My boyfriend has been amazing though, he never pushes me too much, always puts me first, but it's very discouraging for him that I nearly always turn him down, and I know this is not okay and something needs to be changed. 

Right now I don't know what I expect from posting this, but I want to gain back my libido and sex life, because I'm too young to be like this. Thoughts?"|danceau|True|https://redd.it/ejxz7y|8|0.73|0|16|1|twoxchromosomes

I really like him, he treats me amazingly, and I love his personality and the fun we have together. The issue is me and my insecurities. 

I have gone from being physically abused, to having guys who played mind games with me ever since I was 18. Only one or two out of the men I have been in a relationship have not been a dick. This along some probably deeper abandonment issues has caused me to become really insecure in my relationship. The other day I did not hear from him from afternoon until the next mid-morning which is weird for him. Between that time I called him and texted a couple times asking of he was okay. I overreacted completely. I was literally sobbing for like 10 min because I thought he was ignoring me and was going to leave me ( has happened previously to me). Turns out he left his charger at his parents and his phone died. 

After this I felt just awful. I know I overreacted and I know that my current mentality is not healthy for me. I guess because I have not had healthy relationships in the past I always assume the worst. I do have a therapist and will be making an appointment soon to talk through these issues and maybe develop some coping skills.

It makes sense you know? “Hey that makes me uncomfortable, please don’t touch me there.” 

My stepdad was messing with my hair half an hour ago while I was watching Netflix and I asked him not to (it’s really short so I keep it tied back in a stick-up ponytail that seemingly everyone likes to mess with) but he kept trying to mess with it. I flinched away and ducked a bit and kept asking him to stop and he said something along the lines of “oh it’ll only take a second” or “it would’ve been over by now if you just let me do it” and I jokingly said “that sounds kinda rapey don’tcha think?” and a couple seconds later he went for my hair again and I ducked and said “please don’t do that”. That led to him yelling at me that I’m overreacting and he was condescendingly talking about how awful of a life I must have for me to “flinch away at every loving touch” I get which must be why I shut myself in my room all day where I don’t have to have any human contact. All I had asked is for him to stop messing with my hair. 

I didn’t want to stay in the living room where he would say more shit to me even after he said “I’m going to stop now” twice, I couldn’t finish watching my show in my room because that would be proving his point of me “shutting myself away”, so I’m going to bed.

This made him even angrier and he started screaming at me, stamping his foot and eventually kicked our free-standing radiator over at full force.

I freaked out, got upset and tried to leave. 
He kept making excuses, saying he only did it because I was ignoring him. Eventually he apologised and we made up.

But this behaviour really scared me. It reminded me a lot of my childhood and sent me into a panic attack where I threw up.

ejxu8j|2020-01-04 15:20:23|Need help for a friend|"I have a friend who recently came to me for help and I’m not sure what to do. My friend lives with her mom, aunt, and uncle. They live in a shared apartment but each have separate bedrooms. Well my friend discovered that her uncle installed a camera in the shower and has been recording videos of her showering. She found the videos he had recorded and has been feeling sick, even scared to go home.

The real reason I posted here was because my friend doesn’t know what to do either. She wants to go to the police but isn’t sure there’s anything they can do. She’s also scared that since her mom splits the rent with her aunt and uncle, that if anything happens, the aunt and uncle will leave. If they do leave, then her mom wouldn’t be able to afford rent and be forced to be homeless. 

I really need help because my friend hasn’t been herself. What should she do in a situation like this. This is all I really know about the situation. I don’t know if there’s parts she left out. She does have the video proof that her uncle is the one who has been recording.

We always have a lot of skinship, like hugging or just holding hands. When we’re sleeing together after a night of partying we tend to spoon or cuddle. But nothing ever happened. 
We slept naked once after a wild hotel night, but again nothing happened and I’m not really shy about being naked around friends anyway.

I'm 25F and have never given birth or even had sex TBH. I'm going to my GP on Monday, and presumably then to a gynaecologist (never been to the latter before), but wondering if anyone on here has experienced anything like this.

My labia literally **have an extra fold** on the left side, and it's bigger and (when I'm standing up) sticks out more than my inner labia/labia minora. This fold also starts well in front of my actual labia (and in front of my clitoris, urethra and vaginal opening), sort of in the middle of the ""crack"" of my labia majora, before diverting to the left and extending backwards to end around the same spot where my labia minora end. When I view myself from the front in a full-length mirror, this thing obscures the view of my actual labia. It's also really stretchy -- can be tugged out a full 2 inches in length or so.

ejhuv8|2020-01-03 16:36:57|After Years of Overlooking Pink and Red Flags I’m Celebrating These Green Bois.|"After years of subpar relationships looked through through rose colored glasses I sat to reflect on my current relationship after a few events happened and I wanted to give this shoutout of appreciation.

Recently my bf came to me and talked through this situation— he was talking to a person in his friend group and they mentioned having recently broken up with their girlfriend of a couple months, citing a conversation in which this guy told the girl she should lose weight and she dumped him (I guess she decided to lose 200lbs right then and there)

My bf was taken aback, and also cited this guy sending him a misogynistic meme and had slid into the DMs of a few girls in the group in a way that was a bit weird/creepy. He decided he couldn’t let it stand and called the guy up to tell him that he was uncomfortable with these things and what he thought they  said about how this guy viewed women, and that he wouldn’t be allowed at my bfs future social gatherings for the time being because of this behavior.

And I was just. so. proud. As someone who is personally part of the metoo shebang, I used to have an ex that would only quietly object or stand in silence as the “lovable asshole” of the group verbally and physically harassed me. He would still continue to hangout with this person and even invited them to our shared home, only asking me about whether I’d be okay with that after he already talked to him.

And I wanted to share some of the other green flags here:

1) when I shared about my sexual assault that happened as a teen, he listened, thanked me for trusting him, and asked permission to ask me questions, but only if I was comfortable.

2) He calls his mom every week and his grandmother 2x a month. Just to see how they’re doing. 

3) when we first started dating I was dealing with a 75 hour week finishing up grad school and working. Scheduling was tough for me . He simply said “I completely understand and hope you rock your finals, I’ll still be here when the dust settles.”

4) He positively regards women. He has many female friendships in which he offers support as well as company and good times. He listens to their love lives and health concerns and shows up for them in the same way as his guy friends. He is respectful of boundaries. Heck he is like this with all of his friends. He is someone a lot of people in his circle reach out to for support.

These green flags weren’t requirements in a relationship for me before. I would think, “I can live without a guy who does/doesn’t do x or thinks y.” But then I think, especially as a bi girl that was my own misandry holding men and women to different moral capabilities. Now that I’ve been open to all these green flags I’ve started forgiving less and expecting more characteristically from men in my life— and feeling lucky as ever to have my women’s-marchy, active by-standing, feminist dude in my life.

Anyway, I've been losing a decent bit of weight recently, dropped about 20ish pounds in the last month or so. My old size used to be a 36DD. I always hated having big boobs, but I figured maybe with dropping some weight, they'd at least go down to a D.

I went to a specialty shop that does measurements (not VS, which is usually guessing, but this place takes a bunch of measurements to figure it out). Turns out I'm actually now a 34E. 

I'm trying to schedule an appointment with my doctor to figure out what's happening because it probably isn't my BC, which I've been on way longer than the weight loss/increase in size. I tried looking around Google, and the only thing I could really find was pregnancy, but I sure as hell am not pregnant. Tbh, based on past experience, my mind kinda jumps to worst case scenario health-wise, so I was wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar? 

I'm not really looking for an exact diagnosis, since that's my doctor's job, but if there are any suggestions of what could be causing this that aren't extreme, I'd really appreciate being able to try to convince myself it's something minor until I can get to the doctor.

ejekiy|2020-01-03 12:07:47|I just want to curl up and cry instead of facing this|"My family/ household consists of myself [30F], my mom [62], and my 9 and 6 year old kids. Sometimes we feel vulnerable as women alone. There's supposedly a drug dealer a few doors down and there's only a few homes on this hillside. I have a large dog who barks when people are near the house, the road is pretty much right against the back of the house. But we haven't had any real issues since we moved here in March. Until now.

We're low income and I would guess our neighbors are, too. But I got enough money together to make the drive to visit my brothers and whatnot for a few days. We enjoyed our mini vacation and got home late Wednesday night.. and found our front door ajar, and the house a wreck. They stole probably just what they could carry on foot - a handful of cheap jewelry, our smaller TV (32"", lightweight), the PS4, and the games the kids got for Christmas. It's a blow financially in that I can't really replace those now, and some of it was Christmas presents, but the worst part is that now none of us feel safe, or comfortable. We're all struggling with our emotions, especially my daughter who doesn't want to be at the house without the big dog anymore, and to be honest, I don't think she realizes that won't fix how she's feeling when we get home this evening. We've all had to spend our 2 nights back, at my best friend's house because they threw virtually everything in the house on the floor and walked all over it with muddy boots - including the beds and the couch. It's an overwhelming mess, and every time we go over there to work on it, I'm scared we'll find the door open again, and more missing. I'm overwhelmed and anxious thinking about how daunting the task to cleanup is, I feel it in my chest and my throat, and it makes me queasy. My emotions are all over, I keep nearly crying over kids movies, the book I read at work, every little thing. 

Maybe it isn't because we feel more vulnerable as incapable women out here, but it sure feels like that made it worse. I reckon even if men lived here, noticing the car gone from a house for a few days and stealing from them would still probably happen. But for some reason, it just feels worse with just us. I have arthritis and my mom is definitely not better off and we have so much to do that we can't get done in a hurry because it's physically exhausting and difficult.

I dunno why I'm posting, I guess I just needed to get this out. Also in case it comes up, we've talked to the police, who have little hope because this stuff rarely gets solved, and our renter's insurance has a deductible higher than this stuff is worth, so it's also useless :/ I'll need to work on getting a better deductible, and making sure I have better records of serial numbers, belongings, and receipts.

ejtd2n|2020-01-04 07:06:23|I live in a country which allows for abortions and I feel so privileged. Happy to answer any questions for those who want more information or have a discussion!|"Hey all!

So I know abortion is a controversial topic, especially within the US, but i don't live there so i can't really understand the full extent of it. However, I am about to have my first abortion in 2 weeks and the total cost, plus an injection contraceptive is equivalent to $370 USD.

During my high school life,  sexual education was a mandatory topic for everyone in grade 9 and 10. We'd learn about various contraception, consent and choices you can make if you become pregnant. Having an abortion was spoken about in a way which didn't seem like a very big deal and it was just a decision you could make if you know you aren't ready to have a child. I do feel really lucky to have had those talks during my teenage years, and allowing me to know it isn't wrong to have an abortion.

Right now, I just started in my dream industry and paying out rent for my first apartment. At this point in time, my partner and I know that we will definitely not be able to afford to raise a child and the expenses that go along with this. I do feel nervous about the abortion, but not the concept of it, but more the procedure and whether or not there will be any complications.

I do wish this was a concept which will be accepted worldwide. Every time i hear stories about those who don't have the choice and are forced to have a child, when they clearly are not prepared for one breaks my heart completely. I know right now, I hate being pregnant, it's exhausting on my body, I can't do my regular training without feeling nauseous and being so moody all the time. I know having kids is not for me and I completely respect those who are willing to have kids and go through with the pregnancy. I mean it's damn hard!

For those who are pro-life, I do respect your beliefs, however, I do not think it is fair that there are people out there who know they aren't able to have the choice of not having children, and on top of that not being educated on the various choices you can have.

For those interested, I'm willing to post an update or answer any questions you have!"|randombae123|False|https://redd.it/ejtd2n|6|0.58|0|4|1|twoxchromosomes

Currently down just over 20 pounds, and thought I’d go to Lululemon (never been before, never knew of it) to use the gift card my husband got me for Christmas. First thing that seemed to put me in a bad headspace was them not having size 14 anywhere. I figured I’d try size 12 and see if that worked. I put on the leggings and while I thought I was looking good for losing weight, the leggings just magnified how much I still have to lose. I didn’t feel confident like  thought I would, I felt horrible. I left the store holding back tears from how stupid I felt for going there. 

This also happened with Soma several years back when my husband bought me nice bras for Valentine’s Day. I know I can get stuff that fits me, but all it did was trigger my emotions with how awful I look. I know he is trying to be helpful and obviously thinks I look good, but I can’t stop the thoughts of beating myself up when I put myself in these stores with nice, expensive items and remind myself how much weight I’ve gained. I feel like it’s a waste of money to spend money for nice stuff like this and I need to lose more weight so I can wear such items.

ej1r8t|2020-01-02 18:09:46|I had a Medical Abortion. Thankyou to all the women who helped guide me|" Weeks ago, I came to reddit to find advice and reliable first hand experience about how to go about the difficult topic of abortion. I found some very good information dating back years on the steps to take and what having an abortion was going to be like. This is partly for my own benefit to process events, but more to guide anyone else who is going through the same things that I did and is struggling to come to the decisions I have made. 
 This is going to be a long one, so I'll try to format if you want to skip to the important parts

 
Background: 
  I'm self employed in my mid twenties. I've had a LDR for the past three years with a guy from another country (yay for reddit) and hadn't had sex in atleast 5 years. It was a bit of a sudden visit from him for a two month stay. I hadn't been on any form of birth control in years. My family on both sides hasn't had a very fertile history, and I had had a miscarriage as a teenager that convinced me I wasnt likely to get pregnant. In hindsight, I was a moron.  I've always been very aware of my cycle through my emotions, and the boyfriend was set to arrive a few days before my period.  
 He arrived and my time of the month came early, ruining my first sexual interaction in 5 years. Just my luck. So for the first five days of his visit, I was curled in a ball having an abnormally painful period. He was great about it. The next weekend was when we had my first enjoyable sexual experiences, and then my last truely enjoyable to date at the end of the weekend. 

  The pregnancy: 
 It didn't make sense until my ultrasound. The dates and emotions all lined up perfectly in my mind the moment the lady confirmed that weekend was the date of conception. Monday and Tuesday was hell for me. I have always been in touch with my hormones and generally a happy person though always stressed. I've had my down times, but I felt like killing myself. For those two days there was nothing to the world. I have never felt that before, and hope to never again. It got better for a few days, until I got the news that my business was shut down. I was the only supplier in my area left to the only distributor within hundreds of miles of a specialty product. My world for the past 5 years had been building that business, and I never even thought that they would cut me. It wrecked me completely. 
 The next few weeks I just assumed the depression and my hormones were taking a huge toll on my body. My breasts were really sensitive. Any time I got aroused I was cramping in agony. Sex was just painful no matter how shallow or gentle he was. I could barely sleep. I had no sex drive and just wanted to be left alone. The Bf was amazing through all of it though.
  I didn't suspect pregnancy at all until at 3 weeks I woke up after two hours of sleep. My insides were all being squeezed. It felt like I had something that wanted to come out of all 4 holes and I couldn't figure out if I should aim towards or away from the toilet first. I was shaking and light headed and had sweat pouring out of me for nearly an hour. I guess that's what my morning sickness feels like. 

 I was panicking. My life has already had enough problems. I'm broke and broken. I've been drinking and smoking heavily. The father is in this country temporarily. I have people scouting me out to move for a new job. A child, let alone being a single mother isn't in the plans for my high strung self. This explains the pain I've been going through. If it's this bad this soon in, how much pain and discomfort would I be having further along? I knew what needed to happen. He did too.    
 After quickly looking at the price of my options, out of desperation I took a drug that is known to induce a period, that has induced me before. I wont name it, because it didn't work and the side effects of puking, diarrhea, cramps, and panic attack wasnt worth it. I've had bad judgement till now, and rather than trying it again to see if it might work...I looked at my options again.  At this point, he was leaving in a week. I was terribly sensitive to smell and honestly couldn't be in the same room with him or another person without gagging at the smells or foods that normally wouldn't bother me. I was having heavy cramps nearly on the hour every day. My quality of life was terrible, but I didn't want to go through the abortion while he was still here. I just wanted to enjoy my time with him for as long as I could. 

Planned Parenthood: Before the Appointment 

 I don't have much money to spare with the uncertainty of a career. I don't have medical insurance that's worth what I pay. The advice I found online was to go to your doctor ( which I don't actually have a GP) to get a referral to an OB... which sounded pricey and uncertain or go directly to Planned Parenthood.  The closest clinic is nearly two hours away. I called and said I'd like to book an appointment for an abortion. I asked for a Medical Abortion rather than Surgical. This was so I could drive myself without asking my father. He knew and supported my decision, but I didn't want to bother him.  Also, I've had a miscarriage long ago and I wanted this to be a private moment for me. She told me the pricing on the phone of about seven hundred dollars and they would only take cash or card. She said Protesters are common, just dont interact with them. Security wont let them into the building.  The appointment was less than a week away. I got there in time for my appointment to pay upfront and fill out consent forms, but had to wait atleast another hour until they finally called me back. 

Planned Parenthood: At the Clinic

 ""What is your full name? What is your birthdate?  Alright hunny. We have you scheduled for a medical abortion, is that correct? Okay. I'm going to have you step into the bathroom. Urine goes in the cup, and stick this long cotton swab inside your vagina and swirl it along the sides. I'll be in the next room when you're done.""
 In the next room,  I was asked to take off my pants and get on the table. The ultrasound stick thingy went in me and I saw the baby. I won't lie, I had hormones all telling me how precious it was and the wonder of it growing in me. But I also knew at this time in life, I needed to put myself first and the baby wouldn't be growing up in an ideal environment for everyone involved. More than anything, environment is the reason I could not keep my little one. It was estimated at 7 weeks, one day. With a buffer of two days on either side. We've got the pictures. 20 minutes total. It's time for step two of the process. 

 I was sent with a packet of birth control information and a picture to the education office. A girl came in and asked questions regarding my safety, if I was making this decision on my own, and if it really is the right decision for me. She was supportive of my breakdown and let me know about services offered for this type of situation.  I got my blood taken to determine if I was anemic, and educated on how to take the pills, what to expect, and how to identify and react if something is going very wrong. Any questions at all: Call. I was then given an antibiotic to take that night, Misoprostol, and Ibuprofen.  40 minutes in there. Time for the Doctor. 

 I waited for 20 minutes in her office gagging from the smell of their lunch. I just wanted out of there. She came in and asked me to recite how to take all of the pills. She gave me a prescription to fill for Tylenol Codeine and told me to take Mifeprostone pill in front of her. Out I went with plans to take the Misoprostol the next night. 

The day of the Abortion: Mifeprostone

I had things to do. I wanted to make sure I could be out of action for a solid two days just in case. That morning I pushed myself hard. At 1pm, the Mifeprostone started to work better than intended. It was just supposed to stop growth of the fetus. Instead, I was cramping and squeezing out clots every time I bent over. I was not ready for this to happen yet. I scheduled it for 5pm that night.  I wasn't sure if this was right, but decided not to call like they said to and just to take the Misoprostol as instructed.  I had food earlier in the day since I was warned I may throw up and wouldn't have an appetite.  I set out an old comforter on the bed. A trash can with plastic bags, and got comfortable.  I took the tylenol. I went to play a video game as I placed the Misoprostol in the back of my lower gums and cheek.  

Misoprostol: 
 Twenty minutes past and I hate the feeling of chalk. I swallowed early out of disgust. Then frantically googled to see if I just fucked up by swallowing early, even though the first pill was already causing me to abort. Within ten minutes I felt nauseous and light headed, with the cramps from the Mifepristone causing me pain, but I was prepared that there was more to come
  I laid down in bed. It's now about 6:30 as the process is starting. Most of the internet people say the worst will be from the 2-7 hour mark. An hour went by of moderate pain while I was running out of the room to the bathroom. I wasnt filling the pads squirting out blood, although twice it was running down my leg. My abdomen felt like it was on fire as I had convulsions of blood and large clots being forced out of me, but the entrance kept getting blocked and uncomfortable. So I would go squat on the toilet and hear the clots pour out. A few times I missed the bowl as it rushed out whenever I slightly bent over. I checked as many clots as I could to find anything identifiable. 
 At around 10pm, the pain was uncomfortable but felt like it was slowing. I had the boyfriend on the phone and asked him to just be with me for a while. I was crying constantly from emotional and physical pain. I wanted to take a shower because I felt so disgusting and it just seemed like a good idea to have hot water on me. The shower had the hottest water possible as I was bending over with it on my lower back for a long time. It lessened the cramps. Suddenly the pain hit me hard. And it just kept getting worse, and worse, then completely unbearable and light headed and dizzy. I started to panic that I would pass out, bloody and naked in the shower. It was likely that the person to find me is the one person who I hope never finds out that I did this. I needed to get out of the shower right now.  I stumbled soaking wet out of the shower and fell into bed with only a towel underneath me. That's my last memory before I passed out from the pain. 


 Nearly three hours later I woke up freezing, naked, with a towel covered in blood. I'm fairly sure that I should have called as I know what was covering the towel was more than soaking through four pads in two hours. I didn't. Why? I knew I was me again. I woke up feeling like the fog of hormones had cleared. I didn't feel depressed. From the past 2 months of pain, I had a realization that hormones made me not handle it nearly as well as I could have. For the first time in 7 weeks... I felt like me again.  I have never been so relieved in my life. I was still in pain. I was still bleeding. I looked through the clots and was very disappointed. When I had my miscarriage as a teenager I saw it, although my first was much further along than 7 weeks, (and admittedly less painful than this was) I regret that I didn't get to really see my little one to mourn how I wanted to. I have the picture. But touch was wanted more. 
 
I continued to be in pain for another few hours, but managed to find some food and function, then go to bed. For the next week I couldn't lift anything or bend over without feeling blood squirt out of me. It was still painful for days. It took a week of light bleeding and some mucously, kinda smelly discharge to come out. A day of nothing, and then bright red blood coming out which scared me. I did a quick search and found that it can be something like new cells in the uterus shedding, so I didn't call the clinic, once again. I'm not phone shy, I just didn't want to be a bother.

 The follow up 

 For Planned Parenthood, the abortion services and follow ups or complications that can be treated by the clinic are all included in the upfront price. I had an ultrasound scheduled for two weeks after the initial appointment to check to see of any tissue needs cleared out. I typed the majority of this as I waited in the clinic. I stopped bleeding completely after 11 days. The ultrasound showed clear of all tissue. 


 I have never needed to use PP before, but I'm so thankful that I did everything how I did it. I'm even more thankful to the rest of the women who have posted online, guiding me through their private and painful experience to make me feel informed of what the experience was going to be like, and comforted by those who have done it before me."|skunksploot|False|https://redd.it/ej1r8t|4743|0.89|7|171|1|twoxchromosomes
ejitj8|2020-01-03 17:44:29|I’m pregnant with twins. I was just told that I will probably lose at least one of them, possibly both.|"These babies were and still are very much planned and wanted. We didn’t intend for twins, it happened naturally and spontaneously, but they’re here now and I’m completely in love. 

I’m 17 weeks pregnant today. At 12 weeks I had a subchorionic hemorrhage, Meaning that part of one of the placenta’s partially detached. This is normally not a big deal. I have continued to bleed on and off in this time. 

However, over the next several weeks my scans showed a diminishing level of amniotic fluid in baby A. I finally got in to see a specialist, maternal fetal medicine, today. Baby A was diagnosed with Oligohydramnios with less than 1cm of amniotic fluid in the largest vertical pocket. 

We spent about an hour talking with the dr, and the outlook is bleak. 

Option 1: baby A dies in the womb and my body doesn’t recognize it, I carry baby B to term and birth both babies at that time. I would have to carry my dead baby inside of me for who knows how long. 

Option 2: baby A dies in the womb, my body does recognize it and I go into preterm labor with both babies. Depending on the timing, this poses substantial risk to baby B. 

Option 3: both babies make it to term. Since baby A’s lungs are supposed to be developing right now, he/she will die when they’re born. They won’t be able to breath. The likelihood is 75-90% that this will happen if I make it to term. 

Option 4: baby A falls into the 10-25% of babies who live after this complication and both babies are ok. 

The dr was not shy about telling me that this is really a doom and gloom scenario. I am... beside myself. I don’t know what to do or what to think. I am pro-life, but I went so far as to ask the dr about selective termination to save baby B. It’s not an option and actually poses more risks to baby B. 

I am having so many terrible thoughts. My mind is going to some really dark places and I feel like I can’t control it. I’m scared, and I’m sad. I feel like I’m all alone even though my husband is here trying to take care of me. Ever since my hemorrhage at 12 weeks, but especially since we noticed the fluid and I did some research about it, I feel like I’m no longer living my life. I’m living every day to get closer to the next day, to get closer to my due date. Every day my babies have a better chance. Every day I’m waiting to hit 22 weeks when they’ll try to save a premature baby.  and then I’ll be waiting to hit 28, where we pass the first milestone towards lessening any neurological defects, then 32 when the babies are capable of surviving on their own outside the womb, and then 38 when I can deliver full-term. That’s over 20 weeks. It seems like such a long time when I’m constantly living in the future, unable to enjoy the moment. 

And what about all the beautiful, exciting things that expectant mothers get to do? Buying furniture, cribs, decorating the nursery, having a baby shower... none of this makes sense to me because it might not happen. So, what do I do? Pick out a bassinet and have my husband go buy it while I’m in the hospital, if things go well? I don’t get to enjoy any of those small but meaningful experiences of new moms because it’s tainted with fear. 

And what do I tell people? Everyone knows I’m pregnant. People at work ask me how things are going all the time. They know it’s twins and that I’m 4 months along. I’m not a very private person, so I don’t want to lie and I’m certainly not offended by people asking. But how do I tell them that I’m now high risk and unlikely to have two live births without making people uncomfortable? 

I told my 13 year old son, and God bless him he gave me the biggest hug he’s ever given me, asked some questions and told me to go drink some water. He’s such a sweetheart and I’m lucky to have him. He was a perfect pregnancy and a perfect baby, even though I didn’t appreciate it at the time (I was 17). 

I’m sorry this got so long. I guess I had a lot to say and ramble on about. I’m feeling heart broken and afraid. I naturally gravitate towards slight anxiety and pessimism, which doesn’t help. I just need to get through this one day at a time. Thanks for listening."|gimmecoffee722|False|https://redd.it/ejitj8|50|0.86|1|21|1|twoxchromosomes

I'm a 21-year-old female and I've suffered from ocd for most of my life. My need to feel clean has been driving me insane for the past few years. My recent obsession is with wiping enough.

I no longer know what is a normal amount of toilet paper to use when wiping. This issue is extremely embarrassing and I haven't had the courage to talk about it with my therapist. I use insane amounts of toilet paper but I can't get myself clean without using that much.

I'm sorry this might sound disgusting but I don't know how deep I should wipe and when to stop. There always seems to be more to wipe the deeper i try. I feel disgusted and stressed every time I have to use the toilet. I also have ibs which causes me to have diarrhea at least 2 times a day and It's making things even more unbearable. Periods make everything worse and I struggle during them the most.

So please tell me how does a normal person wipe their butt when using toilet paper (no baby wipes or a bide, just toilet paper). I don't want to sound creepy but be as specific as you can because I really need to know.

The skin on my clit (hood and clit) are itchy, slightly swollen and peeling. This has been happening for about three days now (weve since put sexy time on hold) but im worried.

ej1ro6|2020-01-02 18:10:39|Something happened to my daughter and my husband still won't listen to ne|"For background my husband's father is very abusive. Only my husband tries to have a relationship with him. The others have banned him from family functions because of how he is. 
My husband's sister doesn't like her dad either but she fell into a bad situation and both her and her daughter live with her parents. He is really awful to the granddaughter I'll call Callie. He has slapped, pushed kicked and jerked her around on multiple occasions. She's four. He has no business touching her like that. I have called CPS multiple times but they never helped or did anything. 


My husband and all of his siblings have even worse stories to tell. For this reason I have begged my husband to stop inviting him over because I am worried about him trying to lay hands on my daughter. Well he says his dad is the only one he'll ever have and he loves him. So he is invited. 


His family was invited over for a late gift giving. All his brothers came and it was wonderful. Till his mom and dad showed up. The dad was already drunk, being loud and ruining everyone's good time. My daughter and Callie were running around playing and he reached out and grabbed my daughter by the arm. He wanted her to sit on his lap. She started screaming and pulled away and he jerked her by the arm. This all happened while I was running to them yelling at him to fucking let her go. 

She screamed and cried but thankfully he didn't dislocate or break her arm. But you could see he had gripped her arm very tight. My daughter is two.  He has no businesses laying hands on a child but especially a toddler.  I told him to leave and he started screaming about how he didn't do anything and that if everyone is taking my side he knows where he stands in the family. We all stood up and told him to leave and he asked my husband to talk to him outside.  My husband came back in really upset and told his mom he was sorry but they had to leave and the dad was never invited back. 

I thought this was a blessing in disguise? Because something worse could of happened to her before my husband would listen to me. But no. He called his mom and talked about it and said ""This is his one and only chance."" 

I said no it's not. He will never be allowed over or to see our daughter again and my husband doesn't think it's fair. He has a scar on his head from his dad beating him in the head with a lamp when he was 8 and he thinks his dad can change. I am seriously rethinking this relationship if he can't let go of this toxic relationship with his dad.

edit: I want to thank everyone for reading and providing insight. Especially to my husband's possible Stockholm syndrome. I will try and work through this with him but we will not be a part of any family function if he invites his dad against my wishes. 

Also thank you all for the legal advice I will be trying to document anything I can on his father in case I do need to separate for the sake of my daughter. 

Than you all so much. ❤️"|Darogaserik|False|https://redd.it/ej1ro6|2989|0.95|2|319|1|twoxchromosomes
ejwexj|2020-01-04 13:05:07|How do I feel better about not wanting to hang out?|"If this is the wrong sub, I’m sorry! I just need some
Perspectives. 

I work in a small environment and most of my closest friends are my coworkers of 2-3 years. There are a few I used to go out with for drinks and whatnot outside of work, but with schedules changes we don’t do that much anymore. When we went out, we would mostly just gossip about work and how we all disliked what we do. I found it to be exhausting and typically had to be convinced to go and wanted to leave after an hour. 

In the last six months to a year, I have gotten a boyfriend and become extremely dissatisfied and burnt out in my job. Still care and love for my friends deeply, but when I go home I want to leave work at work. I hang out with my boyfriend a lot; he is my best friend and hanging out with him does not drain me whatsoever- the opposite. We don’t talk about work unless I need to vent. It is also a point that one of the coworkers in the friend group explicitly hits on me and flirts with me despite knowing I am in a relationship and I have made it known that I am not a fan of him doing that and it makes me uncomfortable. It doesn’t stop him. 

I have been invited out many times and always come up with an excuse to not go. I do occasionally join but every time I am miserable and uncomfortable which solidifies me not wanting to join again. They give me a lot of flack for not wanting to come- sometimes to the point where they show up at my house to drive me with them so I can’t get out of it. They always make me feel super bad about bailing. They’ll use it as leverage for the next one. Things like “Oh IF you show up because you BAILED last time to go see your brother because he’s more important than us, huh”. I typically brush it off, but it is getting to the point where it is weekly and consistent and making me feel bad. But I can’t mentally justify working a 12 hour shift then driving an hour to someone’s house to eat chips and gossip and drive an hour back. I can do that in my pajamas in bed at home. We work 12 hour shifts together- I see them all the time! 

How do I stop feeling so bad about this? How do I just tell them I am too burnt out and emotionally drained after we hang out that I don’t think it’s worth it?"|greedysalad|False|https://redd.it/ejwexj|1|0.6|0|2|1|twoxchromosomes

ejk5lf|2020-01-03 19:16:42|Finally stood up to my now ex-bf, now for next steps.|"It's a bit complicated. We've been together for 4 years and his mother who has Alzheimer's lives with us. She's in a weird stage where she is constantly harassing me, it's because I'm the odd man out and it's super frustrating.

Her newest thing is deciding that she needs to use the bathroom anytime I'm trying to use it or shower, she doesn't do this to her son, just me. I've asked her to use it before I get in, but I think it's just the reminder that I'm in there that's driving the need. Anyhow, last night, she kept doing it while I was trying to shower for the first time in days since she's been doing it constantly.

Afterwards, I was trying to talk to him and he blew up at me about it, got mad that I didn't make her dinner, or want to share the food that I had made. She has her own food that he buys from the store for her. Either way, I've had enough and I sent him this email after I composed myself.

\*\*""\*\*I'm emailing this list to you because I want a digital and written copy for my records. After months of trying to work with your aggression and anger, I've decided that I can't keep subjecting myself to your abuse. Here is a recap of last night's argument and your actions and why they're abusive:

1. You tried to stop me from venting to you. You were supposed to be my partner, who am I supposed to come to when your mother is making my life miserable? I can't go to anybody else about this, and you're supposed to be my teammate so that we're presenting an equal front. I've listened to you multiple times when you've ranted about my family members. I've even gone to bat for you and spoken to them if something has bothered you. Instead of actively listening, you ignore me, tell me to shut up, and then act surprised when I no longer want to speak to you. That's super toxic behavior.
2. Yelled and screamed at me for not making your mom's dinner, despite not being asked. When I told you that it wasn't my job to make your mother dinner you called me lazy, selfish and a bunch of other things. As I'm on a reduced income, I can't afford to feed three people with food that I'm purchasing or being given. I would appreciate being asked first. You've been in charge of buying your mother's food for a while now and if your mother isn't eating healthy by your own admission, then it's because of the food that YOU purchased. I'm not the reason your mother is eating poorly and it's abusive of you to scream and blame me for it.
3. Kicked the trashcan next to me. This is a common abuse tactic. It's meant to scare the person into submission so that they stop challenging your authority. That may not have been how you meant it, but that is how your actions come across. Hitting, kicking, breaking things, these are destructive and aggressive and signs of violence. It's completely unacceptable behavior, you're 30 years old and still throwing temper tantrums and kicking and screaming like a 2-year-old. 
4. You then started complaining about me loudly to your mother. That's not behavior that's conducive to a healthy relationship. Complaining about me to your mother after we've argued puts her in the middle, and even if she doesn't remember, she will remember that she doesn't like me. That damages my relationship with your mother, along with setting up a power dynamic that I'm at the bottom of the triangle. It's also inappropriate as I don't do that to my family, because I want you to have a healthy relationship with my own family members and I know that it bothers you. 
5. You then proceeded to LIE to me when I brought it up. I could hear you through the walls and you told me that I was making it up. That's called gaslighting and it's a common emotional abuse tactic. It's highly manipulative and reminds me about how you kept telling me it was all in my head when you were cheating on me with \[redacted\] and \[redacted\]. You even admitted it to me later that you were talking about me, so why even bother denying it? The only thing you accomplished was destroying my ability to trust you.

You keep saying that this is all because of your mother, but I'm telling you that it's honestly all about YOU. I'm not angry about MIL, I'm angry with YOU. My problem is almost never the instances that start our fights, but the way you handle it when I'm trying to talk to you about your inconsiderate behavior.

I've talked to you multiple times about your behavioral problems and every single time you promise change. I can't keep making the same decision to stay by your side when you keep making the decision to treat me like a doormat. 

I can't keep subjecting myself to your aggressive behavior on a daily basis. I've been writing down different events that have happened, and it's more often than it ever should be. This isn't healthy for me, you, or MIL. I'm aware that there are always more sides to the story and I'm not a saint, but I'm highlighting recent, relevant examples of your temper.

I hope in the future that you're able to find peace, and somebody to share that peace with. If you'd like to learn more about healthy conflict resolution, here is some info:[https://www.thehotline.org/healthy-relationships/healthy-conflict-resolution/](https://www.thehotline.org/healthy-relationships/healthy-conflict-resolution/)**""**

I'm feeling pretty proud of myself for writing it all down and sending it to him because he always manages to make me doubt myself and think I'm being oversensitive. I'm just so tired of constantly being belittled and made to feel like I don't have a voice.

Now for the next steps, I'm worried here because I just left my job, don't really have savings, and me and my mother signed the lease for this apartment. I've emailed the landlord asking for a copy of the lease and about termination options and cc'ed my ex.

ejpxus|2020-01-04 02:11:47|Long Term Boyfriend Getting Scary Rapey|"There are details about this I cannot tell people. I just want some perspective because it can get confusing. 
BF of 7 years can get controlling and abusive. He has combat PTSD so he flares up. I have been financially dependent on him and working on my master’s degree to get higher pay and get independent. 
He fought fire this summer and was gone a lot (which was great). He was curbing his alcohol while on the crew because of it’s physical demands. Once he was laid off he told me and my family he was going to start drinking and smoking heavily. A day after being gone for two weeks he tells me he is “thinking about anal”.
We had not had a chance to reconnect at all and he starts telling me he wants anal. I told him “No. It hurts.” Then the next day ( while drunk) he says he is going to get me drunk and do it to me anyway.  The timeline on this gets wonky because I start to black some of this stuff out. 

He is getting into heavy drinking mode and constantly grabbing my under carriage, tweaking my boobs and constant verbal sexual harassment- with no real loving touch or intimacy at all. 
At some point during sex he has his full weight on my back and is putting his penis right on my butt like he is going to put it in. I dodge and weave and he puts it right back in that position- I jump away and say no. He also did a super creepy stalking me while I was naked in the bathtub & grabbed my ass really heavy with both hands in front of my kids -all of which he denies ever happening.
After that I am triggered AF. I tried to talk about it with him. He says there is something psychologically wrong with me for me to say that he is abusive- (words I never said.- I was very careful how I worded everything and said he was “out of control when he drinks”). We were planning on going to counseling which he felt I needed because of my perception on this. He cancelled the appointment and broke up with me via text after I started talking about him having a problem with alcohol.
Now I am living in his basement. I may have found a new place to live today and plan on leaving and blocking him on my phone & not telling him where I am. Basically if he does not care about me and refuses to apologize, make this right or go get help together he seems like a toxic person. There is a lot more but trying to keep it concise on the sexual stuff because that is the stuff I am not sharing with friends."|Janavivi33|False|https://redd.it/ejpxus|5|0.69|0|19|1|twoxchromosomes

ejzo11|2020-01-04 17:41:44|My disappointing proposal. Feeling super down about the past couple days and my boyfriend’s strange reaction to wedding talk. Am I being unreasonable?|"We have been together for 4 years. He’s my best friend, makes me laugh like no one else, and I think he’s AMAZING. 

He proposed on New Year’s Eve at midnight, and I said yes of course, but I have been ruminating about how he did it over a couple days. It’s not that I wasn’t happy, I was over the moon! It just wasn’t as I expected. 

So, you’re probably wondering what was so awful about how he did it. Nothing was awful, I just wished he had done it slightly differently. I completely understand that I sound super ungrateful right now, and I don’t blame you if you’re thinking that. 

It’s just I had been dropping hints for a while about small ideas for a proposal, so I guess I assumed he’d be a little creative, because I am a SUCKER for that kind of stuff! 

So on NYE we were sat in his car, and he had asked me to pass him something from the side of the door, so I reached down and found the ring box. I was super excited and nervous, especially to hear the words ‘Will you marry me?’ from him. 

I opened the box myself, and he asked ‘So? Will you?’ After saying yes, I put the ring on myself.  We drove back in silence. We were happy, but it wasn’t as I imagined. 

The next following days, I had attempted to ask a few minor questions about our wedding which were met with stressed eye rolls and general annoyance. ‘Please! It’s too early to start thinking about all that’ was the general vibe from him. It’s being paid for by my family so it should be a nice thing to think about since there’s no financial stresses for the wedding. And it’s a happy thing, of course!

My heart sunk a little because I had imagined something slightly more... exciting? It didn’t seem like a big deal to him at all. Oh well. I tried to focus on the main thing which is us. 

I’ve been asking myself: Have I been sold an idea by romantic comedies about what a proposal should be like? 

Anyway, yesterday I had joked about us both being nervous and how I’d wished he’d asked the traditional ‘Will you marry me’ since I was looking forward to hearing the ‘full’ question from him. 
This is where I feel I fucked up.

He got SUPER upset about this. 
He was really annoyed that I would even ask for something more, and said that it is cliche, and that it clearly wasn’t good enough for me. 
I tried my best to hide all disappointment and reassure him.

I know I should be grateful, but I feel he didn’t make much effort because he knew I was going to say yes regardless. I didn’t even ask for an expensive ring, I insisted on a cheap ring.

ejky1g|2020-01-03 20:10:15|Did your dad (or other relative) teach you how to do basic maintenance on your car?|"So, I was talking to my group of girl friends and we were talking about cars. Then it went onto the topic of having to change a tire because one of my friends recently got a flat on the highway. Basically, we all had the same experience of having to learn how to do this on our own, like YouTube or something.

On the flip side, I recalled that my dad just so readily took my brother to the side one day and taught him how to do all the basic roadside fixing stuff. I mean, sure, I could have just *asked* him to teach me, but the fact of the matter is that it was a ""rite of passage for a son"" kind of thing versus just teaching all of his kids how to do something that would be helpful to anyone. Not mad at him, just some kind of idk patriarchal subtlety (?). Like, if I have a car problem, as a female I'm supposed to just take it to a shop or call some manly man to fix it for me because I can't bare to dirty my hands, even something basic like changing out a tire."|WholeWheatBricks|False|https://redd.it/ejky1g|16|0.75|0|28|1|twoxchromosomes
ejr409|2020-01-04 03:43:33|Women with small cup sizes (aa, aaa, aaaa), do you wear bras? Because I don't know why I should.|"I have no idea what kind of size I am. Last I checked it was 85AA or 85AAA (I cant remember). These days I wear bras (in clothing sizes) sized XXL (Im quite a tall person), but the reason I wear them is because I use filling to at least have something on my chest in public.

When I'm at home I usually take it off because even de xxl can be quite tight over long periods of time. It became a routine almost.

But a week ago I received spam from a webshop advertising that they had everything from AAAA to G. I expected bras for kids but I found AAA bras for adult women as well. It made me wonder if it might be worth a shot. They are quite pricey compared to the ones I fill now though.

So, as the title says, do you have a small cup size and do wear a bra? I'm trying to find out if there are more women who had this on their mind.

ejhncj|2020-01-03 16:22:26|Cut my hair really short and now my sig other says I'm unattractive to him|"Obvious throwaway because my sig other is on reddit, though I doubt he subs to Two X Chromosomes.

I (32F) have been with my sig other (33M) for over 2 years and I am very happy, no issues, good communication, and I consider him a best friend. About a month-and-a-half ago, I cut my hair very short (like buzzed). I'd always wanted to do this and at first I LOVED it! I got many many compliments from coworkers and strangers and I also thought I looked fantastic.

When I first got home from the salon, my sig other's face fell when he saw me. He's always been honest and I admire that about him. He said he didn't really like short hair on women but I was hoping after a month he would get used to it and for a while, all the other comments I had received were glowing and positive.

At work and out and about, the many many compliments I've received have woven themselves into a badass cape and I feel like a queen. I walk around in public with my head held high and I wear that cape confidently.

Then I get home and I feel like I take my metaphorical cape off because the one person who's opinion matters the most to me is way different. We had not been intimate since my haircut and the one time a few days ago that we were, he even said that he couldn't get past my short hair and it was a BIG turn off, even so far as to say normally when we wait that long he is more sensitive but thanks to my un-sexy hair, he wasn't (OUCH). I take solace that at least my relationship with him has many other non-romantic facets and I've no doubt that everything overall will be fine but goddamn. Have I doomed myself to at least a year of being non-sexy to my sig other? Guess so.

Should I just get over myself? How do I do that? Now some days I feel like I'm putting makeup and earrings on a Ms. Potato Head after he said that. I can tell it's damaged my self esteem. I feel terrible even posting something this vain when others are posting about serious issues; please tell me if I am making too much of this.

My boyfriend and I are moving 1000 miles away at the beginning of February, so I put in a three week notice on New Year’s Eve. Today I couldn’t take it and quit on the spot. My boss is very condescending and rude. She wants you to figure out things and gets mad when they are wrong or that you didn’t ask questions. It is impossible to ask questions because she was so unapproachable and acted annoyed at every interaction. Today I just couldn’t take it. Something she mentally assigned as my job wasn’t done and she told me it seemed like I checked out and I could just leave if I didn’t want to be there and do my job. So I thought on it for a few hours. Gathered my things and told her I thought she was right, maybe it is best for us to dissolve this early. 

I feel relieved that I left. Nervous about money (though I have enough in my savings). Guilty that I “gave up”. Guilty that I wasted money. Anxious that I may have overreacted. Angry that she made me do this. It is hard to be secure in my decision. 

I hated my job. Every person who worked in the office next to me made a comment on how she treated me. Every person. So humiliating that I let it go so long. 

So. The next month I will be at home. It is too close to our move for me to get a job just to quit in 3 weeks. What can I do to feel better and nurture myself?"|tiny_turtle_butt|False|https://redd.it/ejr78k|3|0.66|0|4|1|twoxchromosomes

Although I'm largely over the taint and brainwashing he had over me, I still have constant reminders about him all the time. Little things mostly, but they happen frequently and thankfully instead of the intense anxiety I used to experience, I just feel annoyed with myself for repetitively thinking about him. Stuff comes up in conversations with colleagues and I'll say, ""oh yeah, the ex and I..."" Or, ""The ex used to....""

Earlier today I was at Ikea and saw some glasses I really liked, then remembered the ex had the same ones. He had a major drinking problem and used to drink whiskey out of these glasses. Obviously after 7 years being together we developed similar tastes in decor, but I was annoyed with the glass and put it down and didn't purchase it.

Like I said, I'm largely over the weird brainwashing abuse victims experience. I no longer have habits that revolve around his expectations and I think for myself. My self esteem is the best it's been in my entire life. I'm becoming more self-actualized and confident. I've come out publicly as trans/non-binary, even legally changing my name, and am currently socially transitioning. It feels amazing to be the genuine and true me I've always meant to be.

Help understanding please|"There are many instances where sexual abuse is obvious, but I’m confused as to if it can extend to my situation. I’ve been sexually involved (no actual intercourse) since childhood, around the age of 5. However at that time it was between me and a boy my age and it wasn’t forced. We would strip down completely and pretend to have sex. 

Throughly my childhood there have been similar instances. I had a childhood “boyfriend” who would try to put his hands in my pants and I didn’t want him to, we ended up getting caught by the teacher in front of the class. A cousin and I used to play house often and we would kiss. Eventually I started developing breasts and he would try and hold me so he could feel them and I wasn’t able to get away. When I was a little older I would stay at a relatives house and there was an older boy there. He would touch me and I felt it was wrong but I didn’t say no. I don’t really remember anything that was said. 

I’m more than ashamed of these times and don’t know who to talk to. I’ve tried telling my therapist but I didn’t really get a response that felt right. These instances are why now that I’m in my 20’s I feel I only matter to guys sexually even if that’s not the case. It’s causing issues in my current relationships and I’m trying to move past it but I feel like I need to better understand it too. I just wish I could forget about it.

I know this is a lot of reading but I hope this makes sense andcan help some people figure out what is right for them. Everyone has different experiences with birth control so feel free to share your own in the comments. Also feel free to ask if you have specific questions about birth control. It is always better to talk to a doctor but I can help clarify this post and give you an idea of what to expect.

***HORMONAL***

*hormonal birth control works by keeping your ovaries from releasing an egg. They also cause changes in the cervical mucus and the lining of the uterus (endometrium) to keep sperm from joining the egg.

*Hormonal Birth Control can have other uses besides preventing pregnancy. For example:
Decreased risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cysts, benign breast disease
Improvement in acne
Less-severe menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)
Reduction in androgen production caused by polycystic ovary syndrome
Reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids and other causes, as well as a reduction in related iron iron-deficiency anemia

ejjax3|2020-01-03 18:17:28|(NSFW) Bought my first dildos ever!|"So (F29) here, I finally decided to give dildos the ol' college try.  Im trying to explore my sexuality a bit more, so I figured dildos were a good first step. This is sorta a big step for me so Im proud of myself!   Though I was kinda embarrassed opening them up for the 1st time.

There's no sex store in my immediate area, so I went online to see what looked nice and what I could (probably) handle.  Bought 2, glass and silicone.  The glass one is a nice 5 inches and not too girthy, but my silicone one is a BIG BOI (bigger than I thought lol) and is a bit of a challenge for me!  The dildos I bought were designed more for g-spot stimulation, which I needed more of in my life.

First time using them, omg I almost never have g-spot orgasms that wild.  I usually orgasm just with clitoral stimulation, but good god tears were streaming down my face after using the silicone one.  That almost never happens for me.  And lets just say that its a good thing no one was in the house at the time.  There was no keeping quiet using those things! xD.   

I already have a vibrator coming in the mail, and Im debating on getting another vibrator (remote) to get for more discreet fun while Im outside. (This has always been a fantasy of mine)

I just wanted to share that!  If anyone has any tips for a newbie or brands they recommend, Id love to hear!

This one fills me up plenty, so it takes me some time to get acclimated. I guess my vag is a little small???  But once Im warmed up, ho damn It leaves me shaking!  I have to not use it for a couple days so I can recover!

 Not too girthy, and I use this to help me warm up before I use the silicone one.  Used it last night by itself and its so so nice and relaxing.  Plus the ridges are quite enjoyable.  Id probably use this for anal if I decide to try it."|InuMiroLover|True|https://redd.it/ejjax3|10|0.68|0|10|1|twoxchromosomes
ejzyhl|2020-01-04 18:02:05|The Casual Misogyny of Billy Joel|" Hi everyone! First time poster in this thread. I am a man and I'm not quite sure if it's suitable for me to put this here. I had planned to post it in Unpopular Opinions, but the TwoXChomosomes page consistently shows up in my feed and thought it would be a good fit. Let me know if not.

So, full disclosure, I am a huge Billy Joel fan. My parents listened to him a lot and I really grew up on him (I'm 32). I saw him a few years ago in Berlin, and Vienna is one of my favourite songs of all time. 

But ever since I was a teenager the song ***She's Always A Woman*** seemed a little off to me. A little what we would now catogorise as InCel-ly:

*She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you*

*She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you*

*And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free*

*Yeah she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me*

*Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants*

*She's ahead of her time*

*Oh, she never gives out and she never gives in*

*She just changes her mind*

*And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden*

*Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding*

*But she brings out the best and the worst you can be*

*Blame it all on yourself 'cause she's always a woman to me*

This plays out as a (beautiful!) love song, but on closer inspection it seems to be more about reframing the relationship in an infantilising way to justify its dynamic.

While those lyrics have always jumped out at me, I’d never really thought too much more about Billy Joel or his songs in that mindset. Until tonight. Just The Way You Are came on while I was in line at the supermarket and it was the first time I’d truly listened to the lyrics. I understand it’s from a different time, and perhaps it’s the movements that are occurring now which have made me particularly attuned to this stuff, but I couldn’t help but feel quite uncomfortable about its concept. Narratively it plays out as a toxic relationship. The main perceived sentiment is the narrator doesn’t need his love interest to change or be anything she’s not, as he loves her just the way she is. However, it develops into a list of commands.

Full disclosure again, I have grown up on this song and technically and emotionally I think it’s an incredibly beautiful song. Which is why this is so strange for me. For anyone not familiar with the song, you can listen along here:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaA3YZ6QdJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaA3YZ6QdJU)

***Just The Way You Are***

*Don't go changing to try and please me*

*You never let me down before*

*Don't imagine you're too familiar*

*And I don't see you anymore*

**(This is pretty fair, nice sentiment)**

*I wouldn't leave you in times of trouble*

*We never could have come this far*

*I took the good times; I'll take the bad times*

*I'll take you just the way you are*

**(Beautiful! No issues)**

*Don’t go trying some new fashion*

*Don't change the colour of your hair*

**(Hmmm, this is where it begins to get tricky. While it could be supposed he is saying don’t do these** ***for*** **him, the later verses of the song start to make it feel as though she shouldn’t do these things** ***because*** **of him)**

*You always have my unspoken passion*

*Although I might not seem to care*

**(Charming!)**

*I don't want clever conversation*

*I never want to work that hard*

*I just want someone that I can talk to*

*I want you just the way you are*

**(What?! He’s simultaneously suggesting she should dumb herself down, suggesting he’s lazy AND suggesting he only wants someone he can talk “to”, not “with”. People may point out that this is just nitpicking semantics, but after suggesting he wants someone dumbed down he doesn’t need to think with, I think it’s set up pretty clearly).**

I need to know that you will always be

The same old someone that I knew

**(You have no room to grow or change if you stay with me)**

*What will it take till you believe in me*

*The way that I believe in you?*

**(Validate me, love me, look how much I believe in this frozen frame of who I believe you to be right now)**

*I said I love you and that's forever*

*And this I promise from the heart*

*I could not love you any better*

*I love you just the way you are*

**(I, I, I, I, I)**

I'm sure I will get a lot of flack from people for being too sensitive, and I do understand it was a different time and era. I just find these lyrics particularly fascinating in that regard.

TLDR: Finally properly listened to the lyrics of one of my favourite Billy Joel songs and they creeped me out."|chestertravis|False|https://redd.it/ejzyhl|0|0.17|0|4|1|twoxchromosomes

So, about a month ago, I matched with a guy on a dating app and we hit it off instantly. It felt like we'd been friends for years, the way our conversations would go. We planned to meet about a week after we started talking, but I ended up getting sick and having to cancel. He was understanding. We rescheduled but due to life and the holidays, that date didn't work either. He ended up not being so understanding this time. He sent me a thread of vicious texts, attacking me for not being able to see him. Keep in mind, this was only two weeks after we had started talking. I told him the way he spoke to me was unacceptable and that it would be best if we part ways. He apologized and admitted I was right, so I gave him another chance. Lol BIG MISTAKE 

This brings us to today. I had thought about the way he treated/talked me previously, and realized I couldn't let it go. My gut was telling me something was wrong, and I decided to listen to it. I politely told him I didn't think we would work out, apologized, wished him the best, and moved on. He ended up sending me a 4 paragraph long text about how cruel I was, how terrible of a person I am, etc. He absolutely exploded. And the kicker? He told me to kill myself and ""use a handgun you fucking (r word)."" I'm so glad I trusted my gut because who knows what would have happened if we had met in person and I made him angry.

I've been sexually harassed at parties and on the street. I know people who have been sexually assaulted, and pretty much every woman I know had been catcalled. It's hard to feel safe walking alone at night.

I mentioned I had been having blood after I orgasm (sometimes quite a lot) and the doctor said that if it ""keeps happening"", I should book a pap smear. I'm too young so I don't know if any doctor will take me seriously about a pap smear.

I know it's not a bruised cervix because it was a clitoral orgasm. Given that this only started happening after I got my IUD, I'm inclined to believe it's somehow connected and not cancer, but the doctor didn't give me any reasons as to why it is happening. Is it the cervix that bleeds? Is it the uterus lining shedding even if I'm not on my period because the Kyleena has made it unstable? What is going on?

• little to no knowledge of at home cooking (usually means takeout 95% of the time)

• cheapest hygiene items (suave, great value)

• has a place to stay, but never necessarily feeling “homey” 

• relies a lot on the new women he meets throughout his life (whether good friends or girlfriends) for food, home decor, etc

• secluded often, doesn’t mean to but does it anyways 

• never actually having dinner at the dinner tables 

• Lots and lots of tv, movies, etc.

My mom and dad divorced when I was about 12, then my mom passed away when I was 17. Never did I realize how differently mom and dad functioned in the household and even now I find myself desperate for a homey feeling.. if that makes any sense. Even now as I’m spending time with him from college/ work I feel almost depressed at his place. Also we have no living room, as it’s ugly plastic flooring and my dad wants to change out the cabinets before installing tile but I feel like he will never actually do it, so right now it’s just an empty house... I almost want to call out my dad for never having a home cooked meal as it’s just driving me crazy how much I realize that he relies on others to make it for him... it’s gotten me depressed and made me want to get my own place ASAP so I can have my own homey feeling.. mom was always the one who had the food, bought me the clothes I needed, the proper hygiene products, etc. Dad tried I know he did I love him to death but I can’t help to feel depressed when I’m here or just plain out feel bad for him... sorry if this is more of a rant but I’m sure I’m not the only one.

ejlwaw|2020-01-03 21:16:06|Advice on sexual harassment|"My girlfriend has been working as a receptionist for a company for roughly 7 or 8 months, and in that time really excelled. She's taken on a leadership role within the center, and became a really important team member to them since she was ALWAYS willing to go the extra mile to make things better.   


Recently one of her superiors received a demotion, and was put into reception underneath her. This person has apparently taken a liking to her, and felt it appropriate to say things not only to her, but to other members of reception that really made them uncomfortable. One of the things having something to do with sitting on his lap...

I'm at a loss because she reported the incident to their HR, and was told that because they have a ""no retaliation"" policy they will not do anything about him until an investigation is completed. Thus, she is being forced to work in an environment where this individual continues to say things that make her, and others feel uncomfortable. She gave her supervisor an ultimatum, but that was met with a response that led her to believe they'd rather keep him than her.

 I'm absolutely at a loss as to what I can do to remedy the situation. She loves her job, and really put a lot of herself into getting things running well. Now she's being told they'd rather keep an individual that is sexually harassing employees than her. In this day, and age I'm absolutely shocked that ANY establishment would do this. I thought #metoo was supposed to bring awareness, and change to these situations. We're well enough off that she could find a new job, but I think it's really heartbreaking for her to see all of her work dashed aside because of this. What can we do, or should we do about this?

ejp9il|2020-01-04 01:20:15|Today a guy at the bus stop told me I was beautiful, and I have mixed feelings about it.|"I (early 20s) approached the bus stop and went to get a ticket from the kiosk. A guy who was already there (looked like he was maybe mid-20s) saw me and passed me a bus ticket he already had in hand; idk if he had an unlimited pass or didn’t need his ticket anymore (bus tickets are valid for like an hour in my city). I said thanks and he said “you look so beautiful, might as well.” A few moments later he walked away, saying “stay beautiful, okay?” as he passed me. 

He came back maybe thirty seconds later and said, “Hey, since you’re so beautiful, why don’t you take my phone number?”

I replied, “Sorry, I’m not looking for anything right now,” to which he said “Nah, it’s cool, I’m just looking for a friend.” 

So I said, “I’m not comfortable giving my number out, sorry.” And he said, “no no, take mine, you don’t have to give me anything” and gave me his name and number. He finally walked away again, saying “text me! I’ll respond right away!”

By all accounts, he was really nice about the whole thing! He didn’t say anything awful or gross, he didn’t ask me for personal info, he didn’t do anything to make me overtly uncomfortable. And yet! I felt kind of...icky afterwards. And feeling icky made me feel worse, because I feel like I don’t have any right to feel icky. 

Like, on one hand, it was kind of nice to be told I was beautiful, and to not feel like the guy would stalk me if I rejected him. And it was really sweet of him to give me his bus ticket; it made a mediocre day a whole lot better. And he didn’t try to follow me or trap me in conversation or anything, he just told me I was pretty and gave me his number and left. 

On the other hand... I can’t help but wonder if he still would have done all that if I wasn’t wearing a crop top like I was today. And “you’re beautiful” isn’t always an innocent icebreaker; the guys who followed me for 4 blocks started by telling me I was beautiful. On top of which... it was kind of annoying that this guy kept pushing even after I turned him down twice, even if he didn’t ask for my own info. 

At this point, part of me gets jumpy any time a guy approaches me in public, whether he’s nice about it or not. I’m tired of my sheer existence being seen as an invitation by so many men. But the flip side of this is that I’m worried I’m being unfair to the guys who really ARE trying to be nice, or shoot their shot, or who have good intentions.

ejbh9v|2020-01-03 06:23:55|I think I want an abortion and it's going against all of my personal morals.|"Let me preface this with I am pro choice. I have always been of the belief if you want to terminate that is your choice I support you. However I personally couldn't imagine doing it. I was personally against it. 

I dont know what to do. I am 13 weeks pregnant with a wanted baby. A planned baby. But I just found out my husband has been cheating on me for the entire time I've known him with both men and women through craigslist ads. Who knows who he has been with. I had my 8 week blood screening for STDs and I am clear but still. The possibilities. 

I have a 4 year old son. I was abandoned and ghosted at 13 weeks pregnant with him. Being alone and pregnant and doing everything on my own was the single hardest thing I've ever done for myself.
 I met my husband only 6 months after my son was born. We took things very slow. I was still in financial and child assistance standpoints a single mom. This year we got married. It was amazing. I loved living with him. It was effortless. Until now. 

I'm exactly how pregnant I was last time I was alone. I cant do that again. He promised me hed never let that happen. I didnt even want another baby perse. I was too afraid of this. He wanted one he assured me hed be there for all of it. I do not want to do this alone again. 

My career was finally going amazing. New promotion. With another one lined up in a year. It was amazing. I was stable. We knew the pregnancy would set me back but it was a hit I was willing to take with his income now contributing. But alone, this is what I'd have needed to provide for my current living son. I put everything into him. I do not want to do this alone again. God it was so hard to be alone in a delivery room for 22 hours of traumatic labor. 

I never imagined getting an abortion. But now it's my first thoughts. I want to take back time. If I was barely pregnant I'd feel more comfortable but I saw my sons 12 week ultrasound. That was a BABY in my eyes. Oh god. I dont think I could go through with it. The guilt may send me into a depression I couldnt recover from. I just want to be unpregnant. I've had the worst pregnancy too. Puking. Nausea. Exhaustion. Hip pain so bad I cant walk. 

This baby was wanted. Planned. Loved. How could I do that. But how can I also demolish a life and career I've built for my son to do this again.

And then there’s the problem with guys.. getting unwanted stares and saying I’m wearing v necks to get attention; no honey, it’s only because I don’t have that many options of clothing that would look ok with my freaking body and all my friends saying I wish I had your boobs - no I’m sure if you acc lived in my shoes you wouldn’t wish that.. I’m very conscious of them cause guess what, gravity has already made them sag a little - I hate going on top during sex because of this very reason or even take shower with someone cause I hate how I look naked..

ejl2ll|2020-01-03 20:18:58|A rant about dating|"I've never really been interested in dating. Like, I want the relationship and the soulmate and the happy ending and blahblahblah, but I've never felt the need to go out and actively look for it. I'm young, so I figured it'll happen when it happens and I'd rather put my time towards other things.

But sometimes I'm like... maybe I should at least ATTEMPT to date. I could use the practice. This impulse usually only happens around the holidays when I see a bunch of cute couple pictures. Jealousy, amirite? But I could at least grab drinks with someone. If anything it'll lead to half-decent sex and a faked orgasm. Whatever. So I've tried Bumble a few times. I've regretted it every time. 3 of my matches who I thought seemed normal and could possibly have potential ended up being complete fucking douchebag asswipes and I just want to rant about them for a second.

1. Sent me an ""accidental"" dick pick on Christmas Eve via Snapchat. On the EVE of THE BIRTH OF CHRIST. Complete with a corny caption that was something like ""I can be your present this year"" or some shit. He immediately apologized and I was like, whatever dude. Thankfully he hasn't contacted me again.
2. Texting this other dude for a second... didn't respond for a day because I was busy. Texts me 24 hours later, ""Uh oh are we through?"" Proceeds to drunk text me 98234 times asking to fuck. I eventually just sent memes back because he was obviously a joke. He continued to ask if we could fuck, even after I sent memes with no context. The worst desperation I have ever witnessed. Blocked and reported.
3. A guy I matched with because he looked familiar. We talked for a second and realized we were in the same undergrad program. Tells me to text him, so I do. I'm immediately turned off by his excessive use of emojis. He typed girlier than me, if that makes sense. I replied a couple times, but his responses were extremely boring and our conversation was going nowhere, so I stopped replying. After texting me a few other times and me not responding, he ADDS ME ON LINKEDIN. Complete with an invitation message of ""Hey, friend. \*emoji\*"" WE ARE NOT FRIENDS! THAT IS SO CREEPY! I blocked him on everything.

Ugh and that's only from the past few weeks. I have been fucked over by men sooooo many other times, I've lost count. I've been blackmailed and extorted. I've been accused of online harassing a guy I fucked ONCE. Had to go to the police about it. Turns out it was his own girlfriend. Which I told him. But he didn't believe me. Got a half-ass apology the other day about it, six months later. Lol.

Also, why can't guys just take the fucking HINT? If someone doesn't respond to me, I don't fucking bother them again! Yet some guys insist on finding you ON EVERY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. Some guys insist on sliding into your DMs MULTIPLE times. Now I'm often too nice and tend to reply, because it's hard for me to ignore people. I feel rude doing it. But I don't owe any stupid ass guy who I've never even met ANYTHING, not even a reply. Especially if I've already been half-assing the conversation because I'm clearly not interested. So in 2020 I'm blocking every guy that annoys me or creeps me out in the SLIGHTEST. I don't give a fuck anymore. Learn social cues. Stop being fucking creepy.

ej7emv|2020-01-03 00:48:15|Dancing “Sexy” as a Ten Year Old|"(I also posted this on r/creepyencounters, but figured it would fit here too) 

I grew up dancing - I took tap, ballet, jazz, hip hop, but my true love was (and still is) musical theatre. Where I live, there used to be a summer camp I would partake in which involved learning all different types of dance. I enjoyed all of it, but the lesson I would always be the most excited for was, you guessed it, the musical theatre class. 

Now, nearly all of the instructors and campers were female. The musical theatre teacher, however, was male. (Not a bad thing, but you’ll understand why I included this detail). 

One year, he decided that one of the songs we were going to learn and dance to was “Hey, Big Spender” from the musical Sweet Charity. Not a big deal, right? Except we were all ten year old girls, being told to act as cocktail waitresses, Most of us probably didn’t even know what cocktail waitresses were at the time. 

I felt super uncomfortable while rehearsing, so I told my parents for the rest of the week that I wasn’t feeling well. They believed me, and didn’t make me go, but what about all those other girls? 

To this day, I still love musical theatre, but I have this deep-seated disgust of performing “sexy” numbers. I’m 18, almost 19, in school for musical theatre, and I can’t believe that it has stuck with me for so long. We’re actually doing a dance unit on Bob Fosse next semester and I’m terrified. 

EDIT: when I was looking up the song to see what musical it was from, to directly quote the wikipedia, this is what I found: “It is set to the beat of a striptease as the girls taunt the customers.” WE WERE TEN YEAR OLD GIRLS."|smolglowcloud|False|https://redd.it/ej7emv|20|0.76|0|7|1|twoxchromosomes

I told them I'm currently on Lolo, and they asked if I had any side effects. I've always dealt with migraines, sometimes with auras, and told the nurse practitioner as much. 

She immediately told me that CHCs (combined hormonal contraceptives [pill, ring, or patch]) had a HUGE risk of stroke in people that have migraine auras, and that these people should avoid anything with estrogen in it at all costs. The doctor who had prescribed me Lolo never mentioned anything. Luckily I havent been taking it for long, and the NP at PP told me to stop taking them *immediately*, starting today, otherwise I can be putting myself at risk.

Please for your own sake, if you deal with migraines especially with auras (loss of vision, numbness, etc half an hour before migraines set in), and you are taking birth control with estrogen in it, talk to your doctor immediately and change over because you're at a much higher risk of stroke (even young people).

ej4spv|2020-01-02 21:41:16|I'm finally feeling like my life is going to be alright|"Last year was hell for me. In February I escaped death when my mentally unstable roommate tried to strangle me because I didn't want to give him my cat. I moved out immediately and lived with my dad for two months, with two cats in my old 3x4 bedroom. I had to temporarily quit university, with only 3 months to go, because I couldn't focus and was in the middle of moving to a new place and legal procedures.

I spend the first 2 months in my new place paranoid, having panic attacks at every strange sound, looking over my shoulder everywhere I went, scared that my ex roommate would find me to finish the job. One of my cats died of a tumor in June. Then I had a mental breakdown last summer. I lost the will to live, tried to get help but got told the waiting list would be over a year. I have never felt so defeated and lonely in my 25 years of being on this planet. As a result I relapsed, and spent a month trying to get sober again, to kick the withdrawals. Reality was hard to keep track of. 

But I didn't give up, one thing that has always been a constant in my life is my refusal to give up.

And just now, I came home from work. When I opened the door, my old cat was waiting at the door, meowing and purring, with the kitten I adopted in October right behind her. My boyfriend, who I recently started dating, was waiting for me on the couch. He was tired but wanted to wait up for me, so he could hear about my day and cuddle me before he went to bed. And now I'm sitting on the couch, watching some Netflix while he is asleep and I'll be joining him soon.

And ladies, life feels pretty fucking great right now. I still got a long way to go, I still need help for my mental health, but right now everything feels alright, and that's good enough for me.

I hope 2020 will be the same for you.

This past year, I went away for work training at a new job and was on my own for the first time of my adult life, and everything unraveled for me. 

He sexually assaulted me and a friend in college, we worked through it and I had forgiven it. His friend also sexually assaulted me in college, and is someone who is still part of our lives, husband has admitted finally that he doesn’t entirely believe it. And my sex drive had declined over the years, I hadn’t let myself realize why, but over the years he has continued to physically overpower me in the bedroom, pinning me when I try to say no and stop and push his hands away. But it’s done from a place where he thinks he’s just trying to make me feel as good as possible.

I took and stayed in a toxic, awful job in his hometown for years to make sure our relationship would continue. I was massively depressed and cried most days I came home, but he was always there to support me and felt like one of the only good stable things in my life. This new job made me feel like I woke up from a coma, wonderful people and great new experiences. Moving for it has now made him depressed, my reaction to being on my own has made him sad and angry. He’s been hard to be around, and I feel guilty not being there for him in the same way I felt he was for me.

We went to the wedding of that friend of his after I got back. I drank too much because I was uncomfortable (horrible reason, well aware), and blacked out, during which time I was apparently flirting with and letting some other wedding guest touch me. I don’t even remember talking to him. He said it was the most predatory thing he’s ever seen in his life. It was one of the worst things I’ve ever done in mine and can never forgive myself.

There are so many more things that have happened that I need to factor in, but this post would become more of a small novel than it already is. Basically, he wants to work through everything and thinks it can all get better. He does so much for me with the best intentions, but sometimes in ways I don’t want or ask for. I’m scared I can’t get past the intimacy issues, I’m scared it’s not legitimate for me to be upset now because I forgave before and didn’t do enough to communicate and stop the ongoing stuff over the years. I’m completely torn in two between wanting to start over on my own, and staying to fix things with this person I still love, just not in the same way I did before.

Edit: I just want to clarify that the incidents weren’t penetration, it was hands/foreplay/being grabbed. I don’t want to label it as rape because of that, I’m just having trouble putting words to what happened without being overly graphic.

Thank you for all of thoughtful responses, I want to respond more to what has been said but I’m a bit overwhelmed, just know it is a huge help and I really appreciate it."|throwaway27363828|False|https://redd.it/eiz4ci|78|0.81|0|37|1|twoxchromosomes

I spent the last 5 years in a healthy monogamous relationship while on birth control, so I all but forgot condoms were even a thing to worry about. Suddenly I am single and would like to fill the deep pit in my heart with some no-strings-attached D. Can you blame me?

I don’t know what it is about my vagina, but I can’t stand condoms. They really take away a lot of the pleasure sex brings: both the sensation and for whatever reason they constantly fall off and we have to reset positions/put on another one, etc.  I feel like they make the guy less hard too, and that’s not fun for either party. 

That said, there is no way I will have unprotected sex with a stranger. I have been sexually active for 10 years and haven’t had an STD and would really like to keep it that way, forever. 

I tried a condom from one of those female collective websites where all the products are tailored towards women, but they didn’t help much. 

Does anyone have any advice whatsoever on how to protect from STDs aside from the standard male condom? 

I am well aware that avoiding sex with people I don’t know super well is an option and I’m willing to accept my fate of celibacy until I find my soulmate if that is my only option. But I really hope it’s not."|chiefyuls|False|https://redd.it/ejbn7f|3|0.67|0|13|1|twoxchromosomes

To those who fear I might face some retaliation from my neighbor, I worried about that all day yesterday as well, however yesterday evening I received a hand-written note from him on my doormat. It read ""I'm deeply sorry. Please forgive me."" It's a sad excuse for an apology but it does make it seem like he won't be causing any trouble going forward. He left the woman's purse outside of his door and it's gone so I think she came to collect it. At any rate, I did let management know about what happened and while they can't really do anything (they told me ""he has always been pleasant in interactions""), I know I have it in writing. I'll be careful entering and leaving for a while, just in case. 

Also, do those of you who called me out on my martyr-like language towards the end of the post, thanks for the critique (sincerely). I thought about it a lot and I do think my anxiety caused me to place a lot of un-due blame on my neighbors, which unintentionally and unfairly painted myself as a saint. I can't truly know what they were doing or if they were there. That said, I don't take back giving myself some credit, at least a little bit, because as a 5'0"" petite woman, I do try to stay out of ""situations"" as much as possible. I am honestly surprised that I had this reaction but I don't regret it at all. I think that if someone needs help and you're in a position to do so, then you have a moral obligation to act (whether it's getting directly involved as I did or calling the cops anonymously). Last night I proved to myself that I can put my money where my mouth is. :)   


ORIGINAL POST:

I was almost asleep at around 3:30 this morning when I was scared out of bed by the sound of a woman screaming. I live in a medium-sized apartment building in a large city; while the building is mostly full of young 20-something professionals, it can occasionally get loud with parties, especially on holidays. But this scream didn't really seem like it was just someone yelling at a party. My gut was telling me that it was violent, that someone needed help.

I went out into my living room and listened by my front door. In the hallway, a woman was pounding on my neighbor's door a few units down. She was crying and begging him to let her back in so that she could get her stuff and go. He refused and there was silence for a minute, and then she started crying and pleading again.

I opened my door and asked her if she needed help and if she wanted to come in. She immediately said yes and rushed into my apartment. I bolted the door behind us.

She told me that she was dozing off when her boyfriend of 8 months, my neighbor, started pushing and shoving her around the apartment. He was in there with her phone, purse, keys, and shoes.

She told me that she wanted me to call the cops on him. For the first time in my life, I called 911. I don't know what I expected; I was shaking the whole time. I explained that I had a stranger, my neighbor's girlfriend, in my apartment and that she needed help. That he hit her and refused to give her her things back.

We waited together in my living room with my boyfriend for 20 minutes until the cops showed up. During that time, her boyfriend came to my door 3 separate times, begging me (and calling me what he THOUGHT was my name but wasn't!) to open up and let him speak with her. I told him that she did not wish to speak with him and that he needed to go back to his apartment. He only listened once my boyfriend intervened and told him to go home.

2 officers showed up at 4:30 and came into my unit to take statements. They went next door and banged on my neighbor's door for a good 5 minutes, but he refused to open the door and did not answer. He hid in his unit like a coward.

In the end, the officers took the woman downstairs to write an official report and bring her home at nearly 5am. They explained that she can have him arrested for theft if he does not return her items tomorrow. I fear for what he may do if she comes back to meet him for her stuff.

She hugged me before she left and thanked me and my boyfriend. The entire time, she was so apologetic; she was embarrassed, she thought she ruined my night.

It's now 7:30am and I haven't slept a single wink because honestly, the only thing that ""ruined"" my night is the fact that not a SINGLE OTHER PERSON even bothered to check their peephole to see what all the commotion was. No one else thought to check on why there was a screaming and crying woman in the hallway at nearly 4am. No one even stirred at the two police officers banging on some dude's door at 4:30am in a low-crime neighborhood. My stomach feels sick. I can't imagine what would have happened if I didn't get home at the time I did tonight; if I had been drinking all night and was too drunk to respond properly or at all; if I had just shrugged it off as some partyer and went back to bed; if I didn't live with my boyfriend, who was able to convince the dude to stop stalking my front door. It's honestly frightening and disheartening.

I don't know what the moral of this post is. I guess this is all just to say... look out for each other. Question when things don't seem right. Step in and ask others if they need help or are in danger. Don't just shrug things off, don't hide behind the anonymity of the city or just assume that everything will resolve itself.

At first it was just verbal, called me a bitch, a whore and a cunt and told me to go die (because I am a woman). He had a big problem with me being a woman. He quickly got violent and attacked my partner, we had to run into a cafe and lock the doors. He nearly smashed the windows trying to get in. We called the police, and he left. Unfortunately, we ran into him again about 15 minutes later and had another altercation, no one was hurt though. The police called me about an hour later and told me that there’s nothing they can do and he’s still out on the streets because of the “mental health aspect”. The officer said they can’t arrest him because  it wasn’t aggravated assault or assault with a weapon. It was all very discouraging and sad, and I ended up talking to the officer about how helpless he feels in the current system and how sorry he is that he can’t make me feel safe. The man that attacked us has these altercations with people on a nearly daily basis apparently, but none of them are “violent enough”. 

The thing is, in the last 10 years I’ve watched my city get worse and worse, more addictions, more mental health issues, more homelessness. This is just a drop in the bucket. I am sad because I no longer feel safe in my city (at 9 am!) and that these people aren’t getting help. Still feel sad today and his words are ringing in my head.

ej6bwc|2020-01-02 23:29:51|How do you decide???? To keep a baby or abort it????|"I found out the week of Thanksgiving (they very first day that we moved into our first house) that I'm pregnant. Confirmed by an OBGYN a week later. Long story of excuses as to why I wasn't on birth control: I had been for 10+ years, wanted to get off, my husband and I had talked about starting a family at different times, but I had also seen a negative pregnancy test so many times and have endometriosis so I just thought it would take us a lot of work to get pregnant. Turns out I got pregnant almost one year exactly from when I went off birth control. Yes...we had talked at times of wanting to have a family. But as of the last several months, I'd been seriously questioning if I want a family and saying over and over that I am far away from being ready to have one (duh, should have gone back on BC. obvi). But here we are now...

I'm almost 30, married to a wonderful person who is my absolute best friend and best partner and would make a great father. We've got a brand new house with extra room in it, money saved in the bank, family close by, good, reliable jobs. Really, every reason to be happy and every thing pointing to being ready. And yet...I cried numerous times a day the week that I found out (the week of our 3rd wedding anniversary). Not happy tears, tears of utter sadness. I felt like my whole world was falling apart. I have a newish job in a very new field and definitely am worried about how this will affect that. But more than that...I just feel no joy at the idea of having a child. Some of it comes from not wanting to be a mom, not wanting to be seen as a mom, not wanting my whole identity and life to change, not being ready to give up on my sacred time with my husband, still being very selfish and enjoying it, not wanting my relationship with my husband to change, not wanting my body to change. None of my friends have kids, most of them aren't even close to being married. I don't want to be the first one, I don't want to be viewed that way. I know it's stupid to put so much on other people's perspective of me but I can't help it. But mostly...it's just the total lack of joy that I feel. The pit in my stomach and the thoughts in my head ""I don't want to have a baby.""

I'm currently just over 12 weeks. We've had our first ultrasound, heard the heartbeat, etc. We have our second appointment on Monday. I keep telling myself to wait, go to that appointment, see what we find out, and then try to decide. I haven't told anyone except for 2 close girlfriends (and my husband). Bless their hearts, they have tried to help but talking to them doesn't help. They keep telling me it's fine to have an abortion. My husband is very supportive and understanding and says that he will love me no matter what and that it's my choice. However, he wants to have the baby and he believes we are strong enough, we are in a good place, that we can still have a great life. 

I want to believe him. I want to give him what he wants. I know it's my choice and my body...but it doesn't just affect me. I wake up in the morning sometimes, having not been thinking about the baby, and then I just feel this immense pain in my heart like my heart is breaking and pieces of it are falling off into an abyss and I have a pit in my stomach. And then other times, I'm fine. I try not to think about it too much, although it's weird to carry around this big secret. It's weird to be trying to take care of myself all the while knowing I might just get rid of it. But if I don't...I don't want to screw it up. Sometimes I'm fine and I think I can do it and I tell myself to trust my husband and trust the timing and that our life will be great, because it's already great. And then I imagine telling people and I just hate the idea. 

But I can't make the decision. Either way. It's too much pressure and I don't know how to do it. How do you decide??? Both decisions are so permanent. Both are so REAL. I know I could have another baby later on if I didn't have this one, but I'm still making a permanent decision about this one. Will I always wonder what could have been? And yet...having a baby is a huge, life changing decision as well. So I just keep pushing it off. 

I also grew up in a very conservative family who is VERY anti-abortion: ""every baby is a gift."" Although I'm not anti-abortion, I never thought I would be in a place where I was considering one. I always thought I would be ""strong enough"" to do it. I know I'd be a fine mother, I know I would take care of my baby, I know the baby would be loved and cared for. I just don't want it. Yet, I don't want to give up on it. Is it guilt? 

Thanks for reading. Any advice or....anything...that anyone can provide would be helpful. I just don't know what to do and it's completely debilitating."|sararuthbloom|False|https://redd.it/ej6bwc|5|0.65|0|18|1|twoxchromosomes

No, I'm afraid that my mammogram technician is crazy, has been hiding it all this time and is going to go full psycho on me.  That she's going to lock me into the machine and keep cranking it tighter and tighter.  That she's going to put me in that horrible machine and then leave for the weekend, turning off the lights and locking the door behind her.  That she's going to tighten the machine until the plates touch and my boob is nothing but blood jelly.

I am reminded of this every time I have a mammogram, and every time I have the same thoughts.  Putting yourself entirely at the mercy of someone you don't know, that you're alone in a room with, and that you have to put your complete trust in while half naked sounds foolish, in literally any other situation.

ej4v6o|2020-01-02 21:46:05|People seem to not care about about women who either regret or were forced into abortion|"I am pro choice and believe safe and accessible abortions should be legal. With that said, my title still stands. People act like it never happens. People act like a forced abortion is a kindness. You cant imagine the hate I've received from other women telling me how LUCKY to have people in my life to love me so much that they forced me to have an abortion.

I was 16, and as naive and stupid as it was I loved the little baby growing inside me. My mom and boyfriend at the time forced me to have an abortion. My boyfriend would scream and cry and tell me I'm ruining his life if I keep 'it'. My mom said I'd be a terrible mother and if I loved him boyfriend at all I'd do it for him and not ruin his life. She also said the second I chose the baby I had to leave and she'd do everything in her power to get the baby removed from my care, even if it meant lying to CPS.

I tried to get a job so i could leave, even went for interviews, but didn't get hired. I now suspect my mother made sure they didn't hire me since she was heavily involved and insisted on talking to the interviewers. 

I remember just begging my mom to give me time to figure shit out. She said the second I chose to keep the baby I must pack my things and leave. Boyfriend's and his parents were on board and wanted nothing to do with the baby, so they said no help from them. My dad who had is own place also felt the same.

In the meantime my mom set up all the appointments. I begged the doctor for help and said I felt like my mom was forcing me and not giving me options. The doctor just handed the papers over to me sign (for consent) and told me I'd feel better when it was all said and done.

I started begging my and crying and just pleading with my boyfriend for help. Just fucking HELP ME! He just kept reiterating that if I loved him I would do this for him. Then he started talking about marriage and the future. How things would be better in a few years when we were older and we would have a baby then. He promised me that if I did this for him, in a year two we'd try again. Trust me I know how stupid this now when I'm almost 30, but I was 16 and so stupid, so yeah, I started believing him. 

On the day of the abortion I just broke down. I didn't want to do it, but what were my options really? Be homeless and probably have my baby taken away because of my mom? How fair was that to my child. Nevertheless, i begged nurses at the hospital for help. I just bawled and begged them and told them I didn't want to be doing this. I loved my baby and I couldn't. They said I'd feel better afterwards. They said I'd feel relief.

I woke up during the procedure and just starting screaming for them to stop, that I want my baby, STOP. They didn't. I was put back out. 

I never felt relief.

My boyfriend ghosted me afterwards and had baby with a good friend a few years later. Right after the abortion I lost my mind and convinced myself I was still pregnant... I talked to the baby every day like it was still there. I just couldn't handle it... then I got my period and tried to kill myself and ended up institutionalized. I just couldn't take the guilt and regret. How I was utter failure, how I obviously didn't even deserve my baby to begin with if I couldn't have been strong enough to just leave and do everything on my own.

The pain never went away with therapy or meds. For over a decade I cried multiple times a day for what was lost and over how terrible a person I am. I wasn't able to be around babies/children or anything baby/child related without having a meltdown and feeling suicidal. My baby would be 13 years old now. Every day I wonder who they would have been, what they would have looked like. I wonder if in another reality if we're happy together, or if I was as terrible as my mother said I'd be.

I have a son now. He's almost one, but the guilt hasn't gone away, if anything its made it fester a bit more because I know the true depths of my cowardice now. I wish I had the guts to tell my mom to fuck off and die in hole. I feel nothing but anger and bitter resentment when she holds my son. She doesn't deserve to.

But, whatever, I'm lucky. That's what people tell me. I'm so lucky she loved me enough to put me through all that."|upsidedown-insideout|False|https://redd.it/ej4v6o|7|0.65|0|9|1|twoxchromosomes
ej95a1|2020-01-03 03:03:44|No one has seen my friend/coworker (F19) for month. I'm really worried, what can I do?|"I'm really worried about this situation and I don't know what to do. I'm keeping some details vague on purpose to protect her privacy.

TL;DR: No one has seen my coworker for a month. We have tried contacting her, and she has not responded. What can I do to help?

Long version: I have a coworker that I have worked together with for about 1.5 years now. Let's call her Maria, she is 19. Maria is a wonderful person; she is kind, devoted to her work, and is truly passionate about what she does. I work in a small company of 10 people. No one has seen Maria in about a month. The last time anyone at my job saw her was December 2nd, when she briefly stopped in for a meeting. She did not show up to a different meeting the next week. She usually comes in during the afternoon/evening, while I work in the mornings, so it is not usual for me not to see her for extended periods of time. It was only brought to my attention when my boss asked me last week if I had seen her. My boss then let me know this week that he has been emailing her for a while now with no response. I texted her this week, and he has texted/called her and she has not responded to either of us. She has a long term project she has been working on that requires regular maintenance, and when we checked on it, it was clear this project is now beyond repair, so it has been a long time since she has come in and worked on it. 

Maria is a paid intern at our job. She is 'employed' at our job through an organization at a local college, so they handle her paychecks and may have her emergency contacts. We have no contacts/phone numbers on our end. She attends this college, and this organization has weekly meetings on campus during the term. The school term starts on Monday (December 6th), and I think the organization has a meeting on December 10th. I know a student in this organization, he has not seen her either. I also know someone who helps run this organization and I am thinking of going to her Friday or Monday to ask her to let me know if she shows up to the Friday meeting. Does this sound like an okay idea?

Her project was part of a larger whole project, and because it was not maintained, it will take us at least 2-3 months to redo it. I mention this because I'm worried that she is not answering because she worried/ashamed that this has happened. I honestly do not care that she didn't do the work.  I just want to know she is safe. We all just want to know she is okay. This is absolutely not like her at all. She is usually a very good communicator, and 100% devoted to her projects. She is a first generation college student and I know that this all is very important to her. She has told me so. If she was going on vacation or something, I really feel like she would have told someone. This said, December is when her college's Winter Break is, so there is a chance she is simply out of the country and forgot to tell us. She also lives with her Mom, her Mom's boyfriend, and her 4 younger siblings. 

I'm a 21 year old woman that has lived in our area for a while. Walking around on the college campus alone at night is generally considered to be unsafe. Obviously, I'm really worried sick and I don't know what to do. I may be completely overreacting, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. This said, I've been very careful about who I ask/talk to about this, as I don't want rumors or something to start about her in case she is going through something extremely personal she doesn't want people to know about. She disappeared around Finals time, so I'm hoping that she may have """"just"""" had a moment where she couldn't stand the thought of coming in to work, the project broke because of it, and she isn't responding because she is embarrassed. I can't help but think of the worse case scenarios though. I'm really hoping that she'll show up when classes start again. I also want to respect her privacy and don't want to butt into business that isn't mine.

What do you all think I should do?  What is there that I can do? My boss is trying a few other ideas on how to get in contact with her, so I'm not alone in this. I would really appreciate your help and I hope it is okay that I posted this here. 

Thank you in advance."|WorriedThrowaway_2|False|https://redd.it/ej95a1|2|0.75|0|6|1|twoxchromosomes
eiy3i1|2020-01-02 13:14:35|How can I (23f) face my brother (30m) after a strange night of unwanted attention?|"I don't really know who to talk to about this, so here I go:

A little Backstory: we adopted my brother 3 years ago when he already was an adult. Ever since, we have been really close and have treated us as siblings. There was never any sexual tension. He also has a wife that is living in another country at the moment. 

So on christmas eve, we had a guest staying over, why my mom appointed us to her room. It has only one bed, but it's a big one for two people. My brother and I have slept in the same room before, allthough in bunk beds, but I didn't want to offend him, so I just went to bed.

A few hours later, I awoke to an arm that was grabbing my waist und these humping movements on me. Like really close....I was half asleep still and thought that maybe he was too and that it would just pass. But then he he started to pull on my blanket and I kind of froze. I didn't want that but I also had no idea what to do. I didn't want to cause any problems because maybe he thought I was his wife....luckily, I was laying on my blanket and he couldn't lift it. But then he started pulling at it again, stronger this time and almost ripping it from me...that's when I panicked and rose to sit up at the wall, because he was laying on my matress...He immediatly tried to pull me back done at my shoulder but I pulled his hand off me and sat there in silence, not knowing what to do...He asked whether I was warm too. I said no. He layed back down and said that he must have rolled far from his side.  I sat there for a few more minutes and then layed back down too. 

The next morning, I just left the room in a hurry. I didn't plan to tell my mom because she loves him so much but somehow I did. And she said that he must have been asleep and missing his wife. I was confused and disgusted, felt objectified and blamed it on me. I avoided him for a day because I couldn't look at him. Then the next day, when we were supposed to drive to my grandma's, I texted him that I didn't want him to treat me like that but that I also didn't want to loose him as a sibling, also because it would destroy my mother. He texted back that I hates himself for thinking about me like that that night and that I would never see him again if I wanted that. I told my mom, she asked my what I wrote to him, we started crying. She said that everyone would leave her and that if she had to choose, it would be me. I cried because I was just sad about what happened and angry because it affected me so much.

We kind of made up now. But I still feel like avoiding him. For me it's hard to look at him. I don't know how to act around him because I'm afraid I will provoke another situation of being sexualized even thought maybe that is irrational.

As I walked back home a car that passed by my side of the street under speed and the driver approached the passenger window just to say a couple of pretty nasty things about my boobs, not long after another man who passed by my side  also thought it was a great idea to blow me kisses and comment on how ""fuckeable"" my ass was.  

Extremely annoyed I simply decided to ignore them but when I reached my street, a neighbor (50+F) whom I only greet by courtesy, told me that she was going to my house to force me to run and that I should stop eating so much.

Honestly, I was shocked and felt incredibly embarrassed and had to get home and cry.  It's perhaps ridiculous but it's horrible how some people think they have the right to comment on how we look, what we should wear or eat, etc.

Planned parenthood was an amazing resource as we were about to head that route for an abortion. But last night, on New Year’s Day, some rumbles and cramps were on our way. Before I knew it she came running out of the bathroom with a smile I had not seen since the first positive test. The relief I feel is nothing compared to hers. I know she was terrified of all the physical pains she would endure, and not to mention our complete lack of preparation for carrying to full term. I reflect on the fact we are so lucky to have these options, as so many people don’t, but that fight continues. We are still planning appointments to ensure her health is tip top and to confirm she is not pregnant. But I have never felt so much relief in our lives. While periods can be the bane of existence, I’ve realized they can also be it’s saving grace.

Right now,  we're going through a rough patch,  I found some conversations between him and a young lady,  that while not explicit, made me very uncomfortable. Things like, he posted that she's so beautiful he needs sunglasses to look at her pictures etc 
I asked him what it was about and he said he was kidding around.  

We had a huge fight a few weeks ago about my daughter. She's almost 16, and she's at the typical rebellious stage ATM. Yes,  she's exhausting.  But she's my kid.  I can't be dismissive of her and the fact that she needs me now more than ever to get through this phase. He doesn't seem to understand that. 

 RN,  the constant snide comments and petty bickering are taking their toll on me. 
I asked him last night if he still loves me,  and he replied that he doesn't know.  He laughed about five minutes later and called me silly.  

But the feeling remains.  I've been reading his texts over the past few days...and he literally doesn't say he loves me back for the past week or so. 
I feel defeated.

Update:
We had a sit down and chat last night. He said that he is frustrated with hours I'm away from home (Christmas, retail, go figure). I have been putting in 80+ hours each week for the last four weeks. He says he knows it's not his first rodeo, but he feels that I'm just being a mom to the kids and an employee and not giving him enough attention.
We agreed to communicate more. Some of my kids have been away for the holiday but they are back today. So I'm taking a week off when they go back to school to spend some qt with him.

ej4tln|2020-01-02 21:43:05|My best friend was raped by a mutual friend but doesn’t want to tell anyone.|"This is my first post on reddit. I’m not really sure how to approach this topic but I NEED to say it somewhere, even if anonymously to the internet. 

Two nights ago was New Years Eve, my friendship group (about 12 of us) went to a party together and at 2am ish walked back to one of the guys in our group’s house, let’s just call him boy (M16). We all sat in the basement turned the lights off and put a movie on, for context everyone was between the stages of drunk and sobering up or up and coming down. One couple went upstairs to a bedroom (context: the guy in this couple had earlier this evening finally rejected my best friend after a love triangle situation) Let’s call my best friend girl (F16). Girl was sitting alone on an armchair, everyone else was squeezed up with other people sharing seats so no one thought anything weird when boy squeezed in with her. They sat in-front of me and I could see them as he started to cuddle her/stroke her arms/legs/pull her onto his lap but they’re good friends so I presumed it was just in a comforting sorry-you-got-rejected-and-feel-heartbroken way not in an i-want-to-fuck-you way. She was super tired and I could hear some things she said like “no I’m comfortable like this” as he tried to shift her but a little while later they stood up and he led her upstairs, I should have followed her but he’s our friend and I presumed he was just going to find a bed for her to sleep in as she was so tired and had been pretty drunk. 

I’m not sure how much time past but the film had finished and a couple of us who were still awake were just quietly talking. Girl opens the door into the basement and even in the low light you can see she looks traumatised. I stupidly stupidly stupidly made the joking comment of “are you okay, you look like you’ve been sexually harassed” because boy gets with lots of girls. She stares at us for a few moments then shuts herself in the bathroom, a few minutes later she comes out, sits next to me and begins just shaking and crying. We go into the bathroom together so she can talk to me but she can’t physically get the entire story out only a few words between sobs. We get some water and sit back down on the sofa, some of the friends who are awake come over to hug her but they presume she’s still upset about the earlier rejection. She gets a little more of the story out after shakily asking “is he here,” I say no but I didn’t realise he had come downstairs whilst we were in the bathroom, when he stands up from a chair in the corner and leaves the basement she physically shrinks in my arms and shakes and cries more, I don’t pressure her to say any more and eventually she falls asleep in my arms. I only hear the rest of the story in the morning when we’re walking to the train station but I’ll say all I pieced together now:

Boy pulled her upstairs and her drunk and tired self went with him, he took his clothes off and then took her clothes off. I’m not sure what order these events happened in but:
•girl repeatedly says she is on her period
•the couple who went upstairs 5 min earlier (including the guy who rejected her) walk in and see girl and boy together (I’m not sure at what stage)
•boy asks girl if she has a condom, girl says they don’t need one they’re not gonna do anything, boy says fine we’ll just talk
•boy attempts to put his dick inside her (she can’t remember specifics but there is LITERAL proof of this as when she came downstairs she went to straight to the bathroom to attempt to pull her fucking tampon out that has been fucking pushed further in)

After all this she managed to snap to her senses, hurriedly put clothes on and run downstairs to us. In the morning boy acted as if nothing had happened and I didn’t confront him as I still didn’t know what had  actually happened, how to go about confronting him and whether girl would want other people to even know. 

In the all back to the station I got her to acknowledge that it was rape. She doesn’t remember whether she specifically said no but refer back to the above bullet points if you have any argument that this wasn’t harassment. 

Girl doesn’t want anyone else in the friendship group to know as we’re both relatively new to the group and she doesn’t want to split the friendship group from boy as everyone is really good friends with him and has been for longer, he usually hosts the gatherings and I think she’s embarrassed (which she should definitely NOT BE). 

So I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to act around boy, I don’t know how to honour her wish and not tell other people about this and I don’t know how to help her - is bringing it up just going to remind her of bad memories? 

The only advice I’ve given her so far is to talk about it to the mum and dad friends couple in our friendship group at the next gathering but I’m not sure she will. Please give me advice and I’m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post in. Thankyou :(

Edit: forgot to clarify boy had drunk alcohol/ smoked weed and taken ecstasy I think but was still in control as he does a lot of drugs in general. He has also got with a girl in the past who had just been crying over how no boys would ever find her attractive."|angel-online|False|https://redd.it/ej4tln|2|0.67|0|3|1|twoxchromosomes

I work in a downtown area with a lot of sketchy people,  and get harrassed pretty often on my walk to him. Once with him, we are left alone to enjoy our walk and chat.

So today I had one of the most frustrating encounters on my way to him. I was crossing the street during a walk sign and a turning car almost hits me. I shout out in confusion and anger, and they stop just shy of hitting me. Two sketchy guys  on bikes are on the side of the street I was heading to and see the exchange. One starts riding his bike very close to me slowly and in my path, so I can't go around, and the other circles behind me. The one in front says ""hey there baby, you are sexy"" or something to that effect. I am already super pissed at the car interaction so I immediately and aggressive respond ""do NOT talk to me, please"". He came back with ""I take it back bitch"", and thankfully leaves. 

I am so resentful right now. The rest of the walk I am on edge that he and his buddy are going to come  make a scene. The rest of my workday, I will be fuming and less productive. I have purple hair so I am easily memorable, and I hate that now I have to wonder if I will be remembered or recognized. I hate that walking with my fiance is the only way to be left in peace.

We almost always take our time, a lot making out, oral sex etc. so I don’t think it’s because of foreplay. 

I do have really dry skin just under my vagina and my outer-labia. A few weeks ago my fiancé was looking up my vagina and noticed a little blood, it looked like a little wound but I don’t get how it happened (this was after sex).

ej4weh|2020-01-02 21:48:24|How in the world do I help my teenaged step-daughter navigate having a healthy sex life?|"Forgive me if this is a bit disjointed, I am feeling overwhelmed and lost. I am a newer step-parent to two teenagers, a boy (15) and girl (16) who are both incredibly sweet, kind, and polite. 

Last year we began having some issues with our daughter, she became more interested in boys. We weren't concerned about that so much as the graphic sexting and naked photos we discovered that she had been sending. Many of them were unprompted and the recipient/s were surprised. Additionally, any time a boy had asked she obliged, she gave someone a blow job on the bus in front of a bunch of other kids, skipping the bus to go have sex before school, etc. At the same time, she had begun to basically flunk out of school. So we took away her phone and focused on talking with her about healthy relationships, working on how we present our own relationship in front of the kids, we became much more selective about what we allowed the kids to watch on tv, put her back into public school (she was enrolled in an alternate school when I first came into the picture), and trying to work on her self esteem. We enrolled her in track, but her grades meant she was not allowed to race. Her mother basically yelled at her for two weeks, called her a dirty whore, and moved on and then enrolled her drivers ed while she was still flunking school, sent her on a week-long trip to Florida, has let her go to every school dance and football game, gave her a car for her 16th birthday, gave her two huge 16th birthday parties, and then gave her an i phone 3 months after we took away the phone we paid for.

There isn't a lot we can do about that, co-parenting has been something of an issue so we just try to be as stable as possible and focus on what we can on our end. We did manage to help her get her grades back on track, thank god. But as you can imagine, she fell right back into sexting, videoing, photos. She is again skipping school to have sex with multiple partners. She is also now losing friendships, and she doesn't seem to understand why - which is concerning for me. For example, one of the boys she has been sleeping with was introduced to her by her friend, who was interested in him. Our daughter doesn't understand why her friend is mad at her for sleeping with him. She is also absolutely okay with not having any friends because she feels like she makes new friends easily. From our view, she makes ""friends"" with boys easily, because she sexts with them and sends them nudes. 

We have talked to her calmly. We are trying to suggest that she have some standards. I am trying to point out just why her friends may be upset with her. We are pointing out that what she's doing is considered child pornography. She is obviously on birth control, now. We are trying to educate her more about sex, consequences from sex, STIs, etc. We are trying to say hey we get you're going to have sex - but you can be sexy without being naked. You can be cute and hot and desired without doing this stuff. In the midst of one of these conversations, she asked me if there was a way to have ""double birth control"" and she mentioned that ""he didn't even came in me when we had sex"". And I realized, she doesn't even know the fundamentals about sex, how to really speak about it, or what these words even mean - yet she's sexting stuff that makes me blush (and I was a porn store manager in my early 20s). 

It's so odd and I feel absolutely lost. My husband is kind of losing his mind and we just can't get on the same page with her birth mother. Her mother seems to scream, yell, then reward randomly. She also seems to be reliving her high school experience through her. For example, she let our daughter try on her old high school cheerleader outfit and while she was trying it on thought it would be a good idea to tell her about the time she had a threesome in highschool while wearing it. She also has very loud, graphically explicit sex were the kids can hear them. Our daughter let me know this and mentioned some of the things she hears, and I noticed she speaks similarily in her sexting. The mother is on her third marriage, having cheated on all of her husbands with the kids aware of what was going on (day visits to the house for sex while the kids were locked in their rooms). Not the best influence, but again, there isn't much we can do about that.

I honestly am feeling a bit overwhelmed and like this is over my head. I'm wondering if there are any suggestions for resources we can look into, or maybe classes? Is there a book or even two dozen books that anyone has found helpful in talking about these topics? I would love to put her into counseling, but her mother is adamantly against it. It's an uphill battle without having the co-parenting being strong."|amonikerless|False|https://redd.it/ej4weh|1|0.5|0|12|1|twoxchromosomes

I got a fungal infection on my back. That left a blackish scar(?) I was not all all interested in showing that to my mom and I can't go to doctor alone. So I tried to treat that at home but of course it only got worse and I had to show my mom. Guess what was her reaction?"" Omg you are not even married and you already have a scar. You should have a nice healthy body at least before marriage."" Nani....!!?? Is that what you had to say? Yes I went to doctor with her and got that treated. 

When I wanted to check my eyes because I thought I might need spectacles that time too she had the same reaction. Cause ya know specs are a big flaw. No I didn't get specs.

Now we have a big rule in our house. In short that is:
'When your academic session is going on, you can't do anything else. No hobbies, no housework, no watching tv, nothing. All you have to focus on is to study.'

So after my 12th grade finished, I wanted to learn Japanese. My dad got ready to pay for classes but guess what my mom said? No. You might have already guessed that. Reason?
"" You can't go to any unknown place like that. What if the teacher( female) tries to kill you or kidnap you? We didn't learn anything during our student time and you should not too. I will not take any responsibility if you die and if you do, I'll make sure yiu dad goes to jail.""
No I didn't join the class. I'm crying as I write this. 
And when I tried to learn at home using online lectures , she said, "" Don't learn. Relax till you get an admission and your college starts. Japanese is useless anyway. And you should think about what college to go instead of being distracted by learning. ""
Idk what to say.
I'm overweight, short, dark skinned , have pimples. So yeah I'm told to hate my body . 
I never ever got any emotional support from my family. 

But I guess that's enough. I'm sure no one is gonna read all that but I needed to vent. I don't have anyone who will listen through all that and probably think that I'm exaggerating. Ok I'll stop now. If you actually read that then thanks."|greenwallflower1234|False|https://redd.it/ej1bnw|0|0.61|0|11|1|twoxchromosomes
ej4ekz|2020-01-02 21:13:41|Got possitive results for ureaplasma. Don't know how to tell my bf|"After coming to learn about the kind of person I have been before him , and my sexual past (hooking up with 2 guys, one only once ) my bf requested for me to do an std and gynecological check up. I agreed of course 

When we made that conversation it came to the conclusion he would be really mad if I infected him with something. Probably spit at me, throw me out and not talk to me again ( I am in the wrong for agreeing not using a condom without having gotten any check up )

Now the tests came back. Everything is negative , chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, hiv, mycoplasma etc. The doctor said everything is okay after checking me up. 
The only thing possitive is ureaplasma parvum.
She said it is not something serious. It hasnt caused me or my parter any symptoms.
She prescribed 2 boxes of antibiotics for me and one to give my bf. She said the usual practice is treating both people.

I dont know how to tell him...But I know I should. And that i should not be afraid. But our relationship is really unstable right now, due to me letting him know about my past by not being careful enough with what I was saying.

Edit: I dont want to tell him that during dropping by his house because I think he is gonna go into an anger crisis.

My new year's resolution at the time was moving out of my parents house before my birthday and, for the first time in my life, relax and enjoy the present instead of being overly anxious and trying to be one step ahead of everything. That same day, a year ago, he told me his new year's resolution was for us to move in together before 2019 was over. That was also about a year after he told me he wanted to marry me someday. 11 months ago I realized he was gaslighting me. Now I realize he had been for months actually. As I became more and more anxious he seemed to lost interest in me and gained it in someone else, on whom he started focusing 24/7 while I hopelessly tried to fix things. So 9 months later I had had enough, and while it crushed my heart, I broke up with him because I once promised myself I would always come first in my life. 

A year ago today I never imagined that year would be one of the toughest I have gone through. But now, a year later, it's been some months since I achieved my 2019 resolution, and now I'm writing this from my apartment's couch. I feel like it's the first time in my life that I truly understand myself. I'm happy I have accomplished so much and, while it still hasn't been a day that he hasn't crossed my mind once or twice, I know it'll come, just as many other good things are.

He talked about how pretty she is and if she orders from them again he’ll ‘’give her something extra js’’ <- an exact quote

I don’t think it’s my looks or anything cause I haven’t had a problem with people finding me unattractive (I’m not trying to be cocky and I apologize if this comes off that way.Im saying this to further support my theory of why I’ve never been catcalled). 

I believe I’ve never been catcalled cause I have a naturally serious and have a stoic face and I’m 5’11 so I’m intimidating to a lot of men. I’m not smiley and bubbly all the time so I don’t come off as an easy target. Also sometimes I glare at guys who stare at me pervertedly, especially if those guys are middle aged. Like I’m young enough to be your daughter. Gross. My height + serious face + glare= scary lol. I’ve often hated that I’m naturally serious cause stoic women are often looked down upon. Especially where I live in America. 

So ladies, if you want to avoid being catcalled, try having a serious face, glare at perverts, and be intimidating. Also I want to address that I AM NOT CONDONING CATCALLING. Catcalling is wrong in all ways, shapes, and forms and men (and everyone else too. It’s just that men do it more often than women) need to be taught that it’s wrong and to never catcall anyone.

I’m not condoning catcalling in this post.

I think it's because it feels like such an emotionally unintelligent answer that maybe doesn't even comprehend the seriousness of the confession.  What I WANT to hear is ""Damn. This sucks. You must be in pain right now. I'm sad that I'm the cause of it by not being able to feel the same way you feel about me. Whatever space or time you need to take, please do.""

THAT would show me he cared about me as a friend. Because in a moment I've made myself so vulnerable, after declaring my feelings and envisioning us together, doing snuggly things, being naked, whatever, what the fuck do I care that he wants to give me LESS than that? Do guys really not hear what a pathetic answer that is? 

The rejections that have hurt me the least have been decisive and honest but have honored how I felt and what I have lost. 

With the ""I care about you as a friend..."" guys it just feels so weak and in some ways, placating or conditional. ""I can't give you the beautiful dessert you wanted, but here's a crunched up wrapper, be happy now."" What I REALLY hear is ""I care about you as a friend IF you stop feeling this way right now.""

I no longer try to continue being friends with people who have rejected me. I don't need to be around someone who doesn't want me back; I don't need the reminder; I don't care to fake how I feel. Maybe it's immature or harsh but I just can't handle the sickly condescension of ""Well, I can give you LESS than you want, how's that?"" 

And when I have rejected people, I have kept my distance. I don't think it does people good to try and falsely minimize their feelings to keep a friendship. They should honor what they have really felt, its sheer size. They shouldn't stuff their love back in a little box to settle for something less.

Of course every experience and love-busted friendship is different but I'm curious how people have reacted to hearing those words.

Edit: I wasn't clear enough. This isn't just a response to someone rejecting, but a response to them actively wanting to remain friends and not understanding why you are upset or need distance. I had this happen once and found the obtuseness almost as frustrating as the rejection (he then emailed me upset that HE was rejected and I didn't want to spend time with him.

eiy0o9|2020-01-02 13:07:01|Body Issues/Self Esteem Issues|"Hello.

My partner is dealing with some pretty serious self esteem and body issues. I've got my own baggage, and I've encountered this before (honestly, who hasn't, on either count?), but the more I talk with her about it, the more I struggle to understand how to reinforce her in a way that will help. Her self talk is just so toxic. To be clear, she isn't a supermodel, but I think she's actually really, really pretty. She thinks she's too tall, she's fat, her face is ugly, her hair is the wrong color, her feet are too big.

I was paying her compliments, and working to try to show her what I find really attractive about her, but I didn't feel like I was making progress indirectly. We were clothes shopping (for me), and talking about what I wanted to highlight about myself and what I was maybe not interested in the eye being drawn to, and I asked her, on a whim, how she answers that question. And she said she doesn't like a single part of her body, and she dresses to hide it. She dresses conservatively, but like...not mumus or anything really concealing. She wears leggings and stuff, so I just had no idea it was that bad. I thought I was just dealing with ""my upper arms are bigger than I want, and I've mentally told myself that enough that they look like balloons to me"" issues, which are serious, but honestly. Not to be gross, but she has really, really nice tits, her face is really pretty, she's not athletic, but she isn't really obese (not that bigger women can't also be pretty, but 'fat' is a huge part of her self-talk), she has amazing legs, etc etc. Like, there's a lot there that's really attractive. But when I gently pointed some of these out, her body language got uncomfortable and she said that she just has a ton of criticisms about that stuff, too, but she appreciated that I was willing to say that. As if I didn't believe it. She looked uncomfortable, so I let it drop, because I didn't want to bull into that conversation and maybe make things worse.

I'm really lost here. I have no idea how to make her feel good about herself because she takes my compliments as dutiful, and, truth be told, my compliments game is really shit. I never know what to say. Does anyone have advice, or links to articles where I can read about helping an SO improve self-talk that's this far gone? Has anyone had this kind of really negative self relationship and at least started a comeback? I just want to make her feel like a queen, not just because I treat her like one, but because she actually feels like one independent of me and my thoughts/actions."|2xthrowawayesteem|False|https://redd.it/eiy0o9|1|0.63|0|1|1|twoxchromosomes
eirs1a|2020-01-02 02:21:39|am i a victim of abuse/rape? i need help.|"hi. this is my first post on here. i am a high school girl and i am about 6 months removed from a year and a half long “relationship”. i was barely fourteen when i met the guy in question, while he was 17. he quickly took an interest in me and asked me out, and being naive, i said yes. 

as the relationship continued, it was like an unspoken rule that we would get together after school. this made me uncomfortable, as i was going behind my parents’ back and it really put a lot of stress on me. he would ask me to do sexual things for him. i would never say yes right away, and he would stop at nothing to convince me. whenever i’d put my foot down, i immediately became the bad guy and he guilted me into doing whatever he wanted to do. i started to dissociate during these after school “sessions” because i didn’t want to be present. i was so disgusted that i just hid in the back of my head, if that makes sense.

once we actually had sex, it was a really painful experience for me. i remember telling him to just “forget it”, and that i wanted him to just take me home, but he made me feel as though that was no longer an option when i brought it up. it really hurt physically. he made me promise not to tell anyone what we did because he knew he could get in trouble because of his age.

furthermore, he also began to expect me to constantly put on “shows” for him on facetime. it was exhausting and degrading. any reason i could come up with to get out of doing so was met with another excuse from him. it became increasingly clear that he was fetishizing me because of our difference in age and took advantage of that power dynamic. he loved that i was younger and smaller than him, and explicitly said so many times.

he became so controlling. he forced me to keep my location on Snapchat visible at all times, and if he saw me active on social media he would immediately go off on me about how i wasn’t giving him enough attention. even though he was well aware of my busy schedule, (AP classes and multiple sports,) that wasn’t an excuse to him. he expected to be my top priority without fail. 

he also would tell our mutual friends about everything we did sexually, and when i confronted him about it, he would lie and change topics. i finally found out, months after our relationship ended, that he was aware of how many times i wanted to say no and simply ignored it. a concerned friend told me that he was bragging about it, saying, “my dick was too big for her, and she didn’t wanna have sex, but i forced her to take it anyway.” crude, i know.

you might be wondering why i stayed in this relationship for so long. it sounds like a lie, but i truly did love him. and when you love someone, you’d do anything for them. i didn’t see all the red flags, because they came slowly. for a year and a half, this was my “normal”. i feel like i’m just now waking up from a daze. i am disgusted with myself and i now freak out in everyday situations because i’ll get reminded of him. i feel like i brought this upon myself. i just want to forget. i genuinely feel traumatized.

is this my own fault? was it consensual because i said “yes” after he guilted me into it? are my feelings valid? am i a victim of abuse and rape? 

i ask you to please be kind with your responses. please, i really need an outside point of view on this. thank you so much, and much love to you all. <3"|sweetcarrotline|False|https://redd.it/eirs1a|8|0.62|0|12|1|twoxchromosomes

They had 2 separate restrooms and the only distinction was the urinal in one of them, beside that they were unisex. The line was long for the sans urinal restroom. I asked a random lady if it was okay to use the other one(urinal one). She half-pushed the door open and said, ‘yeah, it’s okay with me.’ 
I was drunk so I cautiously opened the door and initially saw a toilet. I swung the door wider to see a man peeing in a urinal. I closed the door in panic. Then, I looked at the sign again and it still said unisex. So, I went in and straight to the universal toilet, closed the stall, and handled my business. 
When I came out, I couldn’t help but to handle my business and wash my hands. As I did, I apologized profusely to the man at the urinal on the other side of the half wall. He was unbothered by my presence and proceeded to handle his business while comforting me.
I was surprised by that reaction and also I was empowered. I was trusted to urinate near a man; who trusted me to urinate near him."||False|https://redd.it/eig4lb|89|0.75|0|69|1|twoxchromosomes
eitima|2020-01-02 04:49:15|Is it worth me reaching back out to this “friend” or is it too late|"
Hey  this is long so bear with me so I’m 24 and I had a friend who I did genuinely care about and things got pretty bad and there was a hell of a lot of mis understandings. I suffer from depression and I run inward when I don’t feel like talking to people, I can’t cope well with my depression and it drags me down. 

Anyway, me and a friend had a bit of a rough patch in summer 2018 I was at my worst and my dad had been in a huge accident, and I wasn’t sure who I could turn to anymore. I used to look up to this friend and go to her for advice a lot, I can understand why at times she felt used but I can promise it was never my intention to make her feel as such. She sent me this message in 2018 summer. Bear in mind at one stage we spoke daily but it just doesn’t work as you approach adult hood and she graduated and went travelling 

“Hey, it’s been a while since we last spoke and I thought I owed you some kind of explanation. 
Firstly, I owe you an apology for not messaging you on your birthday. I should’ve, so for that I’m genuinely sorry.
For a while now I’ve been thinking about our friendship and I realised that we’re not so close anymore. You always take an insane amount of time to message back or even message and I know you apologise and say you’re sorry but after the third or fourth time it started to sound like an excuse and I never wanted to say anything back, so I’d let it go.
I feel like you only ever speak to me properly or want to see me when you need me for something, but not because you actually want to talk to me. 
Honestly I’m fine if you don’t feel like you can talk to me the way we used to, but I don’t feel like I’m being treated properly so I’m happy to just draw a line under our friendship and move on. I hope you’re doing well and I hope uni is going amazingly, good luck for the future x”

So she sent this message and never really told me that’s how she felt prior. Which was really hard for me to take. We met up and we discussed things and got back on track and things were fine. I then got into a relationship in 2019 with a friend of mine. And she then kinda distanced again I reached out a couple times and she kinda stopped trying and didn’t really message me or anything at all. 

Last time we spoke was may 2019 but I wished her a happy birthday and she said thanks last month and that was it, is it really worth me kinda saying how I feel and possibly drawing a line under it or is it just worth leaving it and letting the distance run it’s course.

Starting with my husband and myself deciding that Christmas would be just us - the two of us and our two amazing kids. Of course my mother reacted poorly. I didn’t know how to tell her that the way she and my father embarrassed themselves at thanksgiving required a break for us. Because if we told my parents they were out of bounds with what they said to my in-laws they would freak out. It would be on the rest of us for not understanding them, or not allowing them to speak freely. But really, as the wife and mother of immigrants I don’t want to hear my father bashing immigrants in countries he’s never stepped foot in. The same man who also called my 8 year old daughter a Lolita because she plays with boys at recess. What kind of grown man calls a little girl a Lolita????

And though my husband fully supports and agrees with my decision to go no contact with my parents, I don’t think his knows how much stress their eventual overreaction is causing. Because they won’t just say okay and go away. Because in their eyes they can do no wrong, ever. If they say something that upsets you - well, that’s on you. Of course they’re easily offended. Funny that. And I’m worried too because years before my husband and I ever discussed children my mother threatened grandparents rights to take any potential kids from us. 

Never mind the sexual abuse I suffered at the hands of my maternal grandfather. And a mother who bullied me into silence because she didn’t want to endanger her ability to adopt. 

The thought of not having to entertain them any more, to not worry about what they say or do around my children, it’s such a weight off my chest. The best way I can protect my family from their toxicity is to end all contact. It hurts a little but it’s more in the realization that I’ll never have parents who aren’t toxic and difficult to be around. They’ll eventually show up to our door. And I know when I tell them why we are no longer maintaining a relationship they’ll flip out. They might blame my in-laws but most likely they’ll blame me because, well it’s what they’ve always done. Because they never do anything wrong it’s just me. Except I don’t believe that anymore.

Shortly before I met my bf I had a male-male-female threesome and loved it. After I started dating my bf the whole experience went to the back of my mind for awhile. Around our 2nd year I started thinking about the threesome more. At the start of year 3, I decided it was an experience I can't go without for the rest of my life. 

Long story short, I sat down with my bf and asked him if he'd want to have a male-male-female threesome. I told him a threesome wasn't something I needed every night, but maybe 1 or 2 times a year. I explained how it was something I felt I couldn't go without. He then told me he was uncomfortable with the idea of sharing me. We continued to talk about what bothered him about it and if I could help somehow. In summary, by the end of the conversation he told me in a depressed tone ""if being with you means the occasional threesome I guess I'll have to do it.""

We are totes fine without kids.) if I might be pregnant, it is my fault.  Bolting awake at night. Getting suspicious about how much I seem to be hearing about babies lately, more commercials than normal about baby stuff.  No friggin clue when my last period was exactly. I remember using it an excuse to stay home from a holiday party... weeks ago.  Too old, too poor, too damaged.. prob’ly.  The usual. 

This is the first time in a long time, decades, it seriously crossed my mind. Boy did it cross.  I spent some intensely crappy interludes considering what that would do to my life, our life. What I had conceivably [no pun intended] done to everyone who would bend over backward for me should it be necessary. What sort of decisions I was prepared to make- none easy. How incredibly fortunate I am to be able to make my own decisions and know I would have support. 

And though I am relieved, it was harrowing to consider so many people who have maybe a couple options- neither great. Or people who are praying for a different result. It crossed my mind, believe me.  That I should be so graced, and be horrified at the concept. It’s a pretty serious deal. I can’t begin to explain how much it dwelt with me as a presence, the possibility. I didn’t tell him or anyone.  For all I know it wasn’t even late! Ladies, mark your calendars.

eit156|2020-01-02 04:05:25|Looking for Advice|"So I have a friend (he is 25M and I'm 26F) that I've known for about 6 years now. He's super smart and helps me with tech stuff when I'm struggling and he also helps me host a website I have for my business.

My issue is that recently (the last 6 months) he's started hitting on me, sending hearts and kissy faces, making inuendos constantly, etc. I told him when it first started that I wasn't interested and I didn't want a relationship. He was upset but he seemed to respect my feelings and backed off for few weeks. However, he started right back up again out of the blue and continues to make uncomfortable advances even though I've told him a couple times since then that I was uncomfortable. When I tell him how I feel he gets really defensive and makes me out to be a bad guy. 

Tbh I don't know what to do because I don't want to lose his friendship because we're really good friends (he was there for me when my mom passed away) and he helps me host my website for free which I don't have money to pay for right now if we weren't friends. It's gotten to the point where I just pretend like he hasn't said anything when he flirts with me but that doesn't seem to deter him either.

What should I do? I don't want to lose his friendship but it's getting to the point where talking to him gives me anxiety."|doubletherandom93|False|https://redd.it/eit156|0|0.5|0|3|1|twoxchromosomes

Day two: It’s really here. And it sucks. Around midday I feel that tugging behind one of my eyes. The elusive period migraine that’s going to come on full force. We’re getting heavy now. Eating any and every thing in sight; but at the same time, nauseous because of the period migraine. Glorious. You wanna sleep but can’t because of the migraine. Lord (and YouTube videos) help me. How am I crapping SO MUCH?

Day three: Sigh. Thank goodness! The period migraine has left the building. My appetite is back because the nausea is gone. Maybe I should clean my entire house top to bottom and do ALL. THE. THINGS. 

Day four: Oh, we sluggish again. But things seem to be slowing down pretty majorly. By the end of the night, I’m thinking of not wearing a pad or tampon at all because there’s nothing there when I wipe. Relief! 

Day five: Surprise, bitch. I’m back. And with a vengeance. 

Day six: Day five was a joke, but we are slowing down once again and getting back on track. This period thing wasn’t so bad. I say this because in my head, I know it’s almost over.

Both of the things with the last two guys were good, life just got in the way it seems (one got a cross-country promotion & the other got busy - there’s a post in my history about this). 

Anyway, those clearly didn’t work out. It’s disappointing because I really did like the guys (especially the last one). I feel like I’m also disappointed tho cuz I’ve come to realize just how much I want a person/relationship. It feels lame to say “I really want a boyfriend” but like... I do. 

I’m finally at a place in my life where I’m happy with myself and who I am, I’m done with school, and I’m settling into my career. Things in my life are falling into place and now I just want someone to go through life with. Being in that first relationship this year (even tho it didn’t work out) showed me what I could have and I want that.

I’m on the apps and I know it just takes time and “meeting the right person” and all that BS... I’m just so impatient and am so ready for it. I see my friends in relationships or starting new ones and I just want that so bad. I feel lame being so focused on this but it also just feels like the next step in my life.

ei9wax|2019-12-31 22:31:18|When a teacher found my 12 year old hips sexy and my nannas response.|"I posted this elsewhere, but I think y'all will like it. 

In middle school, I went to a private Christian School. So you can imagine the dress code. 

It was picture day and my nanna dressed me in my Sunday best. A dress that went close to my ankles, sleeves almost went to my elbows and the collar was at my neck. Barely any skin was showing. I was also 12 with zero concept of sex really. I thought sexy was a curse word, that's how innocent I was. 

Well, a male teacher saw me walking down the hallway and noticed my hips moved in a ""sexy"" Manner. He was so bothered that he ran and told the next teacher I had, a female one. She pulled me out of class and spent 20 mins yelling at me about I needed to stop being so sexy. I, almost in tears, told her I wasn't trying to be and that I had no idea what she was talking about. I hadn't even had my period yet. She told me that even though I wasn't trying I had to stop. 

This wasn't enough for the male teacher who also ran to the principal about how ""sexy"" I was being. The principal went to decided to talk to my nanna about I needed you stop being so ""sexy"". Remember I'm 12. My nanna wasn't having any of it and was steaming mad. 

Nanna: Bluellan isn't trying to sexy. She doesn't even know what that means! It's just the way she walks. But if it makes YOU so uncomfortable, I'll make sure she doesn't wear that dress again. 

The principal turned red and mumbled things and left. My nanna was mad for a week and true to her word, I never wore that dress, but I don't think she forgot about it. 

See, in the 8th grade, I had to attend a banquet and my nanna picked out my dress. It was a short dress, the sleeves barely went to pass my shoulders, the bottom went like an inch passed my fingertips and several inches above my knee. I wore pantyhose, and shoes with a 4 inch wedge, and I also wore make up. I normally didn't wear makeup. And for added bonus, she brought along my tall and very muscular uncle with her to the banquet.......

eipdsj|2020-01-01 23:10:45|Yesterday I most likely got drugged while in a club with friends|"I'm sorry for my bad formatting, I'm on mobile. Also this is my first real post, so sorry if I do something wrong.

Yesterday I went to the club with some friends and we were having a good time. I had something to drink before going inside, but not so much, that I didn't have control over myself anymore. In the club I bought a glass of wine and the last thing I remember is drinking it, after that everything is just gone.

From what my friends told me I suddenly started to dance weirdly and I was unable to maintain eye contact and just kind of stared of in the distance. After that everything just started to get worse and i lost my ability to properly coordinate myself and was just kind of stumbling around. After a while of this my friends understood, that something was seriously wrong with me, so they took me outside and tried to give me some water, but that didn't help at all. Since all our other friends were still in the club and we couldn't leave without them, my friends took me back inside, where I proceeded to pass out in the lounge and slept on a friend's lap for a good hour. ( we couldn't just leave because we were sleeping over at a friend's place and he really didn't want to leave and we had to wait for him). I kept passing out and waking up again for a good half hour, before vomiting all over my best friend (twice) and usually when drunk one should feel better after vomiting, but I didn't show any signs of getting better. They also explained, that at the times I woke up, i did some very weird stuff and behaved myself completely without reason.

 Eventually we left the club and went to the friends house. That's where my first memories beginn and I just remember feeling so incredibly tired and feeling like I'm unable to walk. 

When I woke up the next morning I didn't remember anything, so my friends explained what happened and told me, that they suspected, that somebody put something in my drink. I also think this is a real possibility, because I was fine one moment and the next I was completely gone. Also I've never had such a complete blackout, that lasted for such a long time and I behaved very different to how I usually behave when drunk. ( I've had instances where I had to much to drink, but I have never acted like that before). And I thing sleeping in club is a very hard thing to achieve, even when drunk.

In the morning my best friend suggested to go to a doctor to have a test done to see if I was drugged and I initially wanted to do that too, but after talking on the phone with some people from a crisis hotline I decided not to. I decided against going to a doctor, because first of all, most of these ""knock out drugs"" (sorry I don't know the english name for them) are only traceable for a maximum of 12 hours and more than 12 hours had passed already. Second, since I'm 16 (clubbing and drinking is legal at my age in my country) they would have to call my parents and they are strictly against alcohol, so I didn't tell them I was going to the club and I didn't want to get in trouble. That's also the reason why my friends didn't call an ambulance, when I passed out in the club.

So now I'm not quite sure if I was drugged or not, but in my mind the more likely possibility is that I was. Honestly I don't know what to feel at this point, but I know that I feel very violated and kind of sick and disgusted with myself. It's like somebody violently invaded my personal space. What also bothers me a lot, is that I have no definitive way of knowing if I was drugged or just had a very very bad day with alcohol. Something about not knowing just bothers me a lot. 

My friends were very supportive and did their absolute best to take care of me in the club and I appreciate that a lot. 
But when I tried to explain, that it felt like a kind of violation, they didn't really understand and said that nothing bad happened, since they were looking after me the whole night. But I can't shake that feeling of disgust and feeling sick of myself. Honestly I don't know if maybe I'm just exaggerating and I shouldn't feel as invaded, especially since I don't know for sure, that I was drugged. 

I stopped going to my therapist a few weeks ago and I kind of miss having someone to talk to, so I thought posting here would maybe help. Any advice would be highly appreciated and thank you for reading.

eiene4|2020-01-01 05:38:17|Happy New Year’s Meve, Ladies!|"What is New Year’s Meve, you ask?  I have created this account to tell you!

Christmas is exhausting.  The week before is constant shopping, decorating, cooking, wrapping, gift giving, baking, cleaning, making magical memories for three children, and stealthily moving that goddamned elf in the dead of night every fucking night, not to mention the grand finale of doing Santa’s job on Christmas Eve.  I purchased and wrapped every single gift under the tree this year.  The tree that I bought, brought home, and decorated.  

Do I have a husband?  Yes!  Did he help?  No!  He didn’t even know what any of the gifts were except two.  But I was surprised by one gift on Christmas Day—an Apple Watch!  That he bought.  For himself.  He didn’t even give it to me to wrap in the official Santa wrapping paper with the official Santa gift tags and the official Santa handwriting  so it would match.  He just stuffed it in the stocking (that I bought last year, all carefully selected colors and patterns and embroidered for each member of the family).  Santa doesn’t stuff $500 gifts in stockings.  I can’t tell y’all how humiliated I was.  But I can’t cry.  I can’t make a fuss.  It’s about giving the children happy memories.

Truth be told, I didn’t expect anything from him, as we have been estranged for years, but why did he have to make the watch from Santa?  Just buy it if you want it.  And I had forgotten until the moment it happened that he has done the exact thing before.

So here’s the point.  I spent the days after Christmas continuing to do all the same things, only now I had enough time to plan my sacred holiday tradition: New Year’s Meve. That’s Me-ve.  Me.  My Eve. 

When our marriage started falling apart, I started going out for New Year’s Eve without him.  He didn’t want to go out; I did.  He could stay home with the kids.  I couldn’t stand the thought of starting yet another year with him anyway.  However, New Year’s Eve has always been cursed, and remained wretched even without him.  So I started running away from it.

The last few years, I have refused to start another year even in the same state as my not-so-significant other.  I don’t really want to be around other people either anymore.  I want quiet and most importantly, solitude.  So I carefully select a small-to-midsized city in another state and I drive there.  Not in the middle of nowhere, but not anywhere people would go out of their way to go on New Year’s Eve either.  Usually leaving New Year’s Eve and coming back New Year’s Day.  I have a rule to never repeat the same state twice.  I don’t answer non-emergency texts from kids.  They know where I am going.  It’s hard to explain but they are used to it now. 

I like to go outside and meet the New Year with only the stars and the flow of water.   The stars and the water don’t know or care about the second or the minute or the hour or the day or the month or the year or the decade.  They just stay the same and it’s all right.  This is mine and no one can take it.  If I want to scream into the dark I can.  I can cry.  I can wish.  I can hope.  I can breathe.  I can be free for a little while before I have to go back to work and face the misery of January, the cold without the holiday cheer, and “I hope you all are well rested after the holidays because you have a lot of work to do.”

So ladies, women, girls, anyone who feels the burden of making the holidays magical for everyone else for little reward, have yourself a merry little New Year’s Meve.  Next year, take the night and do whatever you want with it.  I give you permission.  I highly recommend running away for a day or two if you can.  If you can’t, I’m sorry, and I’ll write your sorrows on a piece of paper and light it for you.  I didn’t bring any fireworks to shoot them into the sky this year, but I have a lighter.  Those troubles just burn up into black scraps and disappear into the water.  We’ll get through it.

eicasc|2020-01-01 01:49:03|I’m Married to a “Successful Psychopath”: here are the lessons learned from our relationship. (Can be applied to other relationships in general)|"General info about me (the wife): I’m in my early 20s and a psychology graduate student.

General info about him: He’s also in his early 20s and he underwent a psych evaluation that determined he was a psychopath and that he has antisocial personality disorder (ASPD).

Our relationship: we’ve been married 3 years.

Being in a relationship with a psychopath is difficult not only because of his diagnosis but also because of having to bridge the gap between us in order to understand each other. Here are the lessons and strategies we’ve learned so far to make our relationship work (and might help others):

&#x200B;

* Communication really is key. He may lie and manipulate others but we have a strict policy where he must always be honest with me. This can lead to some uncomfortable situations because he is so strange.

Example: he usually has to pretend to have emotions and has to deliberately display physical emotional responses to others in order to seem normal. With me, he doesn’t do that. It is still strange for me to see him with absolutely no emotion on his face or in his eyes. Sometimes his antisocial tendencies are worse for whatever reason and that’s when the completely blank expression appears.

So, in general, we’ve learned that to have a successful relationship it is important to see and accept every facet of your partner. Do I like that sometimes he goes completely blank? Not particularly, but I accept that it’s a behavior he will always have and I don't want him to hide it from me just because it's offputting.

&#x200B;

* Be able to be yourselves. Being a psychopath means you are practically alien. Getting to know one and accepting them is challenging but the fact that he can be his alien self around me is part of why our relationship works.

So, in general, being the “real” and authentic self to your partner is important. Hiding it can lead to resentment and a feeling of not being understood. Being understood by someone (particularly someone as close as a spouse) can make your relationship a safe haven.

&#x200B;

* Know your partner’s limitations, accept them, and find a way to work around them. My husband is terrible at attention switching, which is common in psychopaths. This means that they can’t easily shift from task to task. I’ve learned that telling him to do things while he is doing something else is fruitless. Instead, we have developed a list system where I list all the things that need to be accomplished that day.

In general, a spouse's limitations can get frustrating, but it is possible to create strategies that minimize the impact of those limitations.

&#x200B;

* Every person ""loves"" differently. My husband cannot feel the emotion of ""love"" but that doesn't mean he doesn't love me. He does love me but it is in a different way. Since he cannot emotionally express love, he shows his love for me through actions like getting me Starbucks when I hadn't even asked for one or folding the laundry so I don't have to.

It just helps to keep in mind that your spouse might have different ways of expressing love. Learn each other's way of expressing love (this goes back to communication) and try to recognize when they are doing something because they love you this way so you can both enjoy the special moments between the two of you.

&#x200B;

* Marriage isn't always about romance and emotion. I chose to marry him because I thought that it would be advantageous for both of us. It would be easier for both of us if we combined our talents and resources through marriage. The simple practicality of our marriage is another reason it works. Looking at marriage as a partnership helps foster this solidarity in life that keeps you both together because it works so well.

Marrying a psychopath is not something I would recommend to anyone because usually, a relationship with one is horrible; for some reason, we work well together. It was shocking to both of us that we ended up in this situation but we are both glad we did.

TL;DR: Learn how the other partner speaks in words and actions, respect their limitations, find ways beyond romance and emotion to work together as a team, and recognize how your partner, in particular, expresses love so that you recognize when they are acting ""I love you"" instead of saying it, even if they aren't feeling it at the time.

&#x200B;

If anyone would like academic sources to a particular fact that I stated, let me know.

ei5d3s|2019-12-31 16:51:38|I haven't had sex in 2 weeks and I'm so happy!|"Last year I entered 2019 in an an emotionally abusive and sexually coercive relationship. If I was tired or sick or just not in the mood, he'd scream at me. He'd refuse to let me sleep and if I tried to leave he'd threaten himself. It was hard, and I was embarrassed that I let myself put up with this. There were other red flags (telling me how to dress, waking me up for sex/starting while I was asleep) and this website really helped put things into perspective:  [https://www.toointoyou.ie/](https://www.toointoyou.ie/) 

A couple of months after I ended the relationship, I met my current partner. He's smart, funny, considerate and treats me like his equal. He never forces or pressures me and sometimes I just think, fuck. How did I get this strong, kind and patient man to notice me, let alone love me. As I reflect on the last 12 months, it hit me: I have been so tired from work that I ended up very sick and couldn't talk, exhausted then I started my period... we haven't had sex in 2 weeks, maybe more. And he has said nothing. He hasn't made any comments, or asked for anything because he knows I wasn't up for it without me having to say shit, or apologise. It seems like such a low bar but I'm so so happy I found him and I can't wait for him to be my new years kiss.

eit9hg|2020-01-02 04:26:18|If scientists magically developed a cheap OTC pill for women that (without adverse side effects) permanently eliminated the need to ever poop or fart again, would you take it?|"So this got way longer than I thought. I took an adderol earlier and I’ve been on a  crazy boring 4 hour train ride. (Should be 3 hours but Amtrak is garbage) This is definitely the dumbest question I ever put in writing but my friend asked me this yesterday after I ranted to her about how the ladies room at my job is ‘less than ideal’ for pooping. I actually had to think about it for a while. I’m honestly not sure if I could bring myself to take it. 


Don’t get me wrong, #2s can be so annoying. There’s nothing worse than having to shit while you’re entertaining guests that won’t fucking leave, Or holding in a fart forever in class. Or worst of all, having to use a poorly maintained porta-potty where you get to add your contribution to a poop mountain that’s on display for any poor soul that has to use it next.  We’ve all been there. It seemed a no brainer at first but after really thinking about I wasn’t so sure. 

First of all when I’m around friends I find toilet humor hilarious (especially if we’re drunk).  I’m 23 and Ive found that the more mature I get in my professional/academic life the less mature I get around my friends.  I’m not too over the top but things like letting a fart out during an awkward silence with friends will never stop being funny to me.  

Secondly (and this is kinda weird trying to explain but if I had to guess, I’m not the only one who feels this way). Taking a dump sometimes is one of those “free best things in life” (no not in the sexual sense). We’ve all had to hold it in through a long day at work/school, It sucks, but that moment where you finally sit down on a familiar toilet and relax almost makes up for the hours holding it.  Im not saying taking a long relaxing dump after work is an exhilarating life altering experience but it might be a small enjoyable experience that I might miss one day. 
 
I wouldn’t say this is a deciding factor but I feel it’s worth a mention. I would only admit this on my secondary reddit account my friends don’t know about is that RARELY, literally once in a blue moon I’ll feel ‘pride’ if I take a huge shit....Ok I probably lost you here (if I haven’t lost you already) but hear me out. Maybe pride isn’t the best word.  I’ll explain it like this; 
I know I’m not the only one that gets slightly disappointed when it’s a “ghost poop” (for you high brows out there, it’s when you shit and it drops too far into the toilet drain to be seen). For whatever reason I naturally just feel like I need to see/assess/judge what just came out of me. 99.99% of the time I look, flush and forget what I just saw forever. But there’s those handful of time I’ll never forget and wonder if it’s the biggest of my life. Compared to the average person I’m a pretty damn small so It’s almost like “wow I did that”. I’ve never purposely shown someone else but I can’t say it hasn’t crossed my mind. I have a gross sense of humor but purposely showing my poop to someone is next level gross. 

The biggest argument for taking the “anti poop pill” is that it would eliminate all potential embarrassing bathroom situations. A few months ago I was using a stall in a crowded Trader Joe’s bathroom. As crowded as it was it was unusually quiet. Naturally my body decides to let out this super long bellowing fart that some little kid with their mom laughed at. I would have liked to avoided being in that situation but is it really that big of a deal?  I’ll never see anyone in that bathroom again.

ei7649|2019-12-31 19:00:30|My Canadian Abortion Experience (trigger warning, obviously)|"Hello ladies,

I'm a longtime Reddit lurker and occasional commenter but have posted very rarely. I'm not that confident in my writing abilities, so I apologize if this doesn't come across very well.

I just finished reading ""A Spark of Light"" by Jodi Picoult. It's an incredible yet complicated novel about an active shooter situation at an abortion clinic in Mississippi. For those of you who are comfortable reading about that subject matter, I highly recommend it. It explores the stories of a number of characters who are at the clinic for various reasons. It highlights the barriers that American women face in terms of their reproductive health. Particularly, access to abortions.

I knew that there were massive differences between the Canadian and American healthcare systems, but was blissfully unaware of the difficulties that you have to deal with. You have  a beautiful country with some wonderful people, but my heart hurts for you. 

This may be inaccurate, but I get the sense that the majority of women here are American. I thought that sharing my own abortion story with you could provide some insight into what it's like to the north. Some of you may value my opinion, or maybe I'm just screaming into the void. Either way.

I am currently 26 years old, and I live in Toronto, Ontario. I moved here from the suburbs when I was 20 for my first year of university. I didn't know anyone except for a guy that I had been friends with in my hometown. We quickly became friends-with-benefits. I'm shy, and this was easier than going out of my comfort zone to meet new people. I had never been on birth control and we usually used condoms, until one night the condom broke. I wasn't too worried, I figured the chances of getting pregnant from this once instance were pretty low. I was wrong.

I was a busy university student, so I actually didn't realize that my period was late until a week after it was due. There was a dollar store next to my apartment building, so I went over and bought two tests. I didn't have to pee, and so I stood in my kitchen chugging water until the urge came. I took both tests, and they were both positive. I instantly knew what I wanted to do. I had 3.5 more years left in my bachelor's degree. I was being supported by my dad, and while luckily I had no student loans, I was in no position to be having a baby. 

The next time my friend came over, I told him I was pregnant. He instantly shut down and said ""You should probably get that dealt with"". This hurt. I was already intending on terminating, but wanted to give him a chance to voice his opinion. His reaction made me instantly lose interest in him as a partner and a friend. It shouldn't have been all on me. 

I hopped on Google, and found that there were a number of clinics in Toronto that would perform an abortion. I actually found one within walking distance to my apartment. I called them, and they offered me an appointment for the next day. I wasn't quite ready, hadn't emotionally prepared myself for the procedure. My privilege allowed me to turn them down, and schedule the appointment for a week later. 

My appointment was scheduled for 8am, and luckily I didn't have any classes that day. I dressed in comfortable clothes, grabbed my health card, and walked to the clinic in about 15 minutes. It was in a nondescript building that looked like a house, but I knew I had found the right place because there was a group of maybe 5-10 protesters who were standing across the street. As I waited to be buzzed into the building, I noticed that they had the typical ""ABORTION IS MURDER"" signs, but they actually didn't say anything. They just stood there, shaking their signs at me and at the cars that drove by. I felt indifferent. 

When I was buzzed in, the lady at the front desk took my health card. I signed some consent forms and I was told to wait. The clinic was a renovated house that was at least 100 years old. It was warm and the wooden floors were creaky. There were a few other women there, but all of them had someone with them, like a boyfriend, a friend, a mom. Eventually I was called upstairs to a small room with a closet and a bed. A nurse came in with me, and we had a quick chat. She explained what was going to happen and how the procedure worked. I started to tear up despite my efforts to hold it together. She told me that I still could change my mind, and asked me if the abortion was my idea. I insisted that this was the right choice for me. I think I was just nervous about the procedure and feeling really alone. She put a hospital gown on the bed, and left the room. I changed into it, and left my clothes and shoes in the closet. 

When I was done, she escorted me to a little ultrasound room where I met the doctor. He was an older white man with an accent, probably German, and he performed a vaginal ultrasound. The screen was turned so I couldn't see it. He dated my fetus at 7 weeks. I then went into the procedure room next door. There was a padded table for me to sit on. I scooted down and put my feet in the stirrups. There was a nurse next to me who gave me some kind of painkiller. I'm pretty sure it was morphine. I felt a warm rush. The doctor inserted the speculum, which I found to be uncomfortable. I hadn't ever experienced one. I felt cramping, and it hurt. I again started to cry silently. The nurse who had given me the medication tried to distract me by asking what I was studying in school. She asked me if I had anyone waiting for me downstairs. I shook my head, and she held my hand for the rest of the procedure. 

When it was done, I was given a moment of privacy to put on those big gauzy underwear and a heavy duty pad. They helped me walk to the recovery room. I was still pretty woozy from the morphine. I was sat in a recliner and they gave me some water and saltine crackers. Suddenly, I felt very nauseous and the nurse rushed over to give me a bowl to throw up in. They said it was a normal reaction to the morphine. After sitting awhile, they asked me to go to the washroom. I peed, and there was a very small amount of blood in my pad. They said I could go home. I changed back into my clothes. They wanted to be sure that someone was picking me up, but I didn't have anybody. Unfortunately, I lied and told them that I had a cab scheduled. They gave me my health card, and I was on my way, past the protesters, and went home to sleep.

I have never regretted my decision. It was the right choice. However, until recently, I was oblivious to my privilege as a Canadian. Not only was my abortion legal, it was safe, clean, accessible, and FREE. I didn't pay a single cent for the procedure, the medication, or the birth control prescription that I brought home. If they had charged me, I wouldn't have been able to do it, which is terrifying. There were no waiting periods. I got an appointment that day at just one of the multiple clinics in my city. I didn't feel unsafe or shamed in any way. I'm grateful.

Nobody ever WANTS to get an abortion, but they should be able to if they need to. I know that my experience is not typical. It was positive, and it may frustrate my sisters to the south. For that, I'm honestly sorry. I wish we could all be given these freedoms. I just wanted to provide some insight on the other side of the coin, what it's like in Canada. However, I do recognize that it may be more difficult in other provinces or less urban areas. My experience was not universal, though it definitely should be."|mermaid_tale|True|https://redd.it/ei7649|55|0.83|0|12|1|twoxchromosomes

eijxns|2020-01-01 16:11:25|A lady desperately wants to prove how big she is and how much she wants Boyd half her age to love her.|"So this happened at work and I'm still mad about it. 

I've worked at my job for 2 years, I've done every job there. I know how all the sauce lines run. I was also sick this day and had barely a voice. My friend described it as an anime voice. 

I was on a sauce line with a new line leader, Melissa. She had never worked in this sauce line before and rather then ask for help, she decided she would just fake it. I was the only girl in the back and the rest were guys. We were supposed to have 4 droppers but the boys were too busy talking and being on their phones to work (making boxes), so Melissa, instead of telling them off for breaking the rules, decided to take away droppers to help the boys continue to be lazy. She also spent all her time, talking and flirting with them. Instead of watching the line like she was supposed to. 

The line was a wreck and it made my job 100 times harder so I tried to help her, by telling her how the line ran normally. Her response ""I'm the line leader, I'm in charge here. I know what I'm doing."" I decided to just drop it. If the numbers were bad because she wanted to act like that, then fine.

Well, the other dropper couldn't keep up and he eventually, missed a lot. I couldn't drop that fast so I told the machine operator to stop. She asked what was wrong and I said we needed to catch up. The other dropper started screaming that it wasn't his fault and he couldn't get the sauce in time and this stuff. Melissa finally comes over and looks at me and says ""You need to stop raising your voice and yelling at people."" Nothing said to the guy who was actually screaming, but instead to the girl who had no voice. I told her ""How can I raise my voice when I barely have one?"" She just glared and said I needed to stop being so loud. The other dropper then told her he was leaving, and of course that was my fault too. 

I went to lunch and started crying because of how much stress and how unfair it was. My friends weren't having any of Melissa's attitude and told the machine operator I would not longer be dropping. Well, since I wasn't dropping she had to get one of her boys to drop, and wouldn't you know she gave them all the help they needed, while she just let me drowned when I dropped. I kept my mouth shut and did my job until the end of the day. 

Well Monday, she was working on the line with me instead of line leading and asked how to drop the jars, I started to tell her, and she responded with ""FINE! WHATEVER YOU SAY MS. PROFESSIONAL ON EVERY LINE AND KNOWS EVERYTHING!"" I shut my mouth and decided to let her make a fool of herself. And boy did she. She messed up the line so badly multiple times that we had to stop and redo it. So now everyone knows she can't line lead, she can't work, and she would rather boy like her then do her actually job.

eif6tt|2020-01-01 06:35:44|How do I help my daughter with body image issues?|"My daughter is almost 10.  Over the past few months, she's begun making comments about not being happy with her body. Things like her ears are too big, knees too knobby, etc.  The thing she is most consistently vocal about is body hair. She has very age appropriate and completely normal wispy light leg and arm hair, but she says things like she is the hairiest girl ever, it's ""gross,"" etc.

I respond by telling her that she is perfectly normal, reminding her that everyone has hair to varying degrees, she is beautiful just the way she was born.  This doesn't appear to help.  I also ask her questions like ""why do you think you should look different, who says no hair is better?"", and try to get her to reflect on the idea that her body image is inside her and she needs to see herself as beautiful and not care about what she imagines other people may think.  For the record, she is a very pretty girl and is not bullied or put down by anyone, not that I've ever heard anyway, and we talk a lot so I know it's not like she's got a mean friend or is picked on at school.

I assume it's just, sadly, the overall constant and permeating influence of the superfical female beauty perfection image that is forced upon all of us by TV, magazines, movies, everything. Even though she hardly ever watches TV, it's still all around us and unavoidable.

I wonder if some of the women on this sub might have advice or thoughts on this topic, and how I can be a good father here and, to the extent possible, help her appreciate herself for herself."|ChangeFromWithin|False|https://redd.it/eif6tt|5|0.67|0|4|1|twoxchromosomes

eikmsk|2020-01-01 17:08:49|What should I do with my life?|"TL;DR at the end. 

I'm 27 years old. I'm not able to work because of an anxiety personality disorder (avpd) so I live on permanent disability benefit. 

The last couple of years I've become more content with my life or at least accepting my situation. I've tried being a bit more social and I gained two new accuaintances. I havent had any friends since I was around 17 because of my anxiety, so that was a big step for me. 

Other than that I've managed to be a bit more active and started enjoying going to the gym. I also eat somewhat healthy. 

I started my first and only relationship 4 years ago and learned so much from it, but sadly it ended in mutual agreement a while ago. 

In the relationship my then bf said he wished the best for me and wanted me to start ""doing something"" with my life so I wouldn't end up with maybe a worse mental and physical health than I had. I felt really unaccomplished and almost scared for my own future, but I still didn't manage to do any huge changes. 

Now I'm trying to learn how to be content with my plain and ""unaccomplished"" life alone. 

Studying or a job is sadly out of the question for me at the moment. I did push myself to try studying again this year, but it threw my mental state way of balance again and made me feel horrible and I had to quit. 

Next issue is I have absolutely no interests. I spend my days watching TV shows or movies, work out at the gym now and then, sit on my phone browsing social media or clean up around the apartment. 

With others I enjoy the cinema, a good conversation, simple boardgames and going for walks. That pretty much it. 


Anyways.. Where do I go from here? What does it take to live a good enough life? I don't really have any huge hopes and dreams for my future. 

I've tried a few friend apps and Facebook groups, but there's not many group activities going on in the area I live. 

TL;DR: Because of serious anxiety I don't work or have any friends and have almost no interests. I want to feel like my life has a bit more meaning, but I'm not sure where to start/what to do."|Tricoloredanonymous|False|https://redd.it/eikmsk|0|0.45|0|8|1|twoxchromosomes
eiar1h|2019-12-31 23:39:47|Sometimes men really suck at situational awareness|"So i just came off a 9 hour shift at a restaurant at a family resort. My job is to refill drinks and clear plates among other things. As it is a buffet people tend to take new plates each time they get food, so we go around clearing plates all night. For context I am a 25 year old female. 

Enter two middle aged men, about 40 if I had to guess. I go to their table, ask if I can take their plates and as I lean forward to take them, I can see that both are looking up and down my body. I feel uncomfortable but decide to let it go. Then I make the mistake of asking the polite “is there anything else I can get you?” 

One man then smirks and says “depends on what you can offer” and the other adds “can you get us some hot chicks?” 

I half-laughed uncomfortably and said I couldn’t do that and walked away. I was so taken aback that they would talk that way to me in a restaurant full of families with children - hell they were there with their partners (i assume) and children as well (they just weren’t at the table at the time).

eiht3a|2020-01-01 12:20:08|Moving on after an abusive relationship (Super long).|"2019 was a seriously fucked up year for me. 

I loved my ex to bits. First love and all, you know? But it did some serious damage to my soul. I've talked to my abuse counselor for months and now that I have insurance, I'm going to seek psychiatric help for my trauma. Hopefully I get medication for my traumatic flashbacks and panic attacks. Counselor talked about the possibility of PTSD and SS. 

I started off 2019 with my ex stopping me from breaking up with him, only to speed and reduce me to tears in fear of crashing and tried to break up with me an hour later. He spent an entire weekend telling me he wants to make new memories with me, that he loves me- spent a date being happy and normal, only to get in the car and tell me we're breaking up. 

Over and over. ""You trained me not to worry about you."" to ""I'm sorry, I love you. We're going to work this out because you're worth it"" to ""I love you, but I'm not going to put any more effort into this relationship"" (yes, actual words), then an hour later after pulling me close- ""I'll never stop loving you"". 

It fucked me up. Every time we broke up, it was as fresh as the first. ""I lost the person I love so much. He's gone and I have to live with that."" Then he comes back. The pain of losing someone, the joy of redemption, then the pain of loss, again and again and again.

I didn't eat or sleep. I'd go days without eating a meal or sleeping more than 2 hours. I stopped going to class because it would trigger a panic attack in class and I'd start crying. Every time he came back, I told him I knew he was going through some stuff, but I wish he'd be a little considerate on what it's doing to me. That I'll be a strong tomato, that love shows when its hard, not when it's easy.

He told me he used me for sex. After I held out through so much, biting back my pain because if I just get through this period and he calms down, we'd be happy again- he tells me after everything I endured that he used me for my body? He said we were breaking up, but I could sleep over since it's 2 AM.

I woke up feeling a stark emptiness, like I couldn't even move. I wanted to die. After everything that happened, he used me for sex. I'm failing my classes, I couldn't remember the last time I ate a full meal. If my parents found out, they'd transfer me and I'd be back in an abusive home.

My ex freaked out. He clung to me, then gave me a bottle of Jaeger. He told me that if I drank it, I'd feel better. After my first drink, he told me I was cute- that my laugh was higher pitched. The first time in a month or so that he felt *warm* and I wanted to chase that feeling- that my R. was back. I drank like 6 shots. He fucked me when I was drunk.

I told him not to stay together with me just because I'm suicidal, because that'd be a fucked up, hostage-situation relationship. He said no- it's because he loves me, that he wants me to feel safe in his home. That he's my home and he loves me so much. I told him that I trust him but I couldn't take another breakup.

He broke up with me a week later, 30 minutes before our 1 year anniversary. I told him that I know we can't date right now- but in the future when we're healthier people, I'd love to try again. He said no- he doesn't feel any sort of love for me. He's on 4 hookup apps and talking to a girl- she likes photography! Drunk texts me. The whole jazz.

I spent our anniversary broken. I cried my eyes out. I was alone. No friends. Early in our relationship he isolated me (I doubt he meant to, he tried to help me socialize later on). He told 2 of our mutual friends to back off, told me I couldn't have a guy best friend (while he had a female best friend, ironically), that when I studied with a friend, he was scared I'd leave him for someone else. I was lost and had my pain burning inside me with nowhere to go. I couldn't tell a counselor my ex told me he used me for sex or got me drunk and had sex with me- he'd be reported and it'd ruin his future. 

He came back. He told me he couldn't believe he treated me the way his mom treated his dad. That usually it's a two-way street but I did nothing wrong and he's so sorry that he lost a connection because of his actions. 

But it was too late, you know? How do you come back after inflicting pain on someone over and over when they kept pouring you love, telling you that they'd be patient, that they love you and they'd wait? Second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth chances? 

When he came back, I still loved him. But it hurt to love him. I asked for a break. I told him I'd come back, I just needed some time to heal before I could love him again. He said no- if I left, I'd never come back.

My love soured. I had so many pent-up feelings from how I was treated, how all my love and patience could be ignored and spat on, forced me to move on- after all, he broke up with me before our 1 year anniversary and even then I reached out and told him I still loved him and offered him a chance in the future and he said no, I'm on 4 hookup apps- then he comes back? 

I was clingy, needy. Needed comfort, love, attention. I was going insane from loving someone who was the source of all my pain.I went on a slow, downwards spiral.

I was patient, at first. Told him I didn't feel the same. That I loved him, but I couldn't handle what he did to me. I asked for a break after a date from San Fran. He pulled over the side of the road at 10 PM and refused to drive, circling the car while I sat, scared that I wouldn't be able to get home. I took it back, told him I didn't need a break.

I got angry. I told him I hated him. For two months. Why are you trapping me? ""You're not happy. I'm not happy. Why are we still together?"" ""Is marriage important to you? I don't think I can marry you after what you did to me."" ""I'm not good to you. Just leave me."" 

He had finally come around. He was genuinely sorry. He took all the anger and hatred I threw at him, but wouldn't leave, no matter how much I goaded him to break up with me. He said he tasted the love we had together and that if he was patient, we'd fix ourselves together, get our happiness back. But I couldn't believe it. How could I, after all the ""I love you, I'm staying and I want you to feel safe with me""'s and all the backstabbing after? Not having a 1 year anniversary, ruining the makeup, living with ""my ex used me for sex""? 

He broke up with me after I pushed him over the edge, told me he's going no contact. I told him the same, that I'm blocking him off everything, that if we talk to be friends, we should do it after some time has passed (2 months).

He drove to my house after a week because he couldn't contact me. But we finally let go after that.

I was emotionally abusive. I've held guilt since the breakup for the way I treated him. Still do. I can't sleep sometimes because I can't believe I could tear down someone who finally saw the error of their ways and was genuinely sorry. That he really did love me in the end and was hurting from what he did to me. I truly believe he did change. I was the monster, in the end. And I will always hold regret for how I treated him.  


The difference between us, however? He broke up with me 11 times, and he was the one who always came back. The one who decided if the relationship was over or not. 

I realized I treated him badly and even if I wanted to early on in the BU, I stopped myself from ever reaching out because I never wanted to hurt him like that again. He knew how badly he hurt me and would come back, over and over. 

I broke the cycle. I miss him, sometimes. I'm just sad that things went so badly with someone I love so much. He's a good person. I hope he's happier."|throwaway-1201|False|https://redd.it/eiht3a|0|0.4|0|10|1|twoxchromosomes

Why are you being charged so much for tampons? I mean, I think most of us feel taken advantage of by the industry, no matter where we live - but the US prices seem disproportionately high when compared to average US income, from what I understand. 


I feel for you ladies. Come to Switzerland, we have snow-capped mountains and cheaper tampons.



Edit: Thanks to a string of informative replies I am cottoning on to tampon culture in the US. Amongst the many points and opinions, these seem to bleed through:


- CVS is not the cheapest place to buy. Shame I’m not staying here another month to take advantage of this information.


- You guys prefer applicator tampons which surely pushes the average price up somewhat. 


- Swiss tampons are not dirt cheap (Switzerland is generally quite expensive). But I am surprised at the cost of US tampons in comparison to living wage. From an outsider perspective, this seems relatively high to me.

However, my ex boyfriend is still living free and happy while I suffer from the trauma he had put upon me. I had trouble getting a hold of my detective and ended up sending in email with new information and things I remembered from when I was 17. But I feel like I will never get justice and it's just eating at me, because I don't want him to do what he did to me to someone else. But I know he will and I know how he picks his victims.

I recently was forced to leave that church he was following me at (you can check my previous postings) and how not a single person helped me and protected me as he constantly harassed me there. Then watching in court these people lying for him and contradicting everything I stated. People who I thought cared about me and my well being. My tears and pain essentially meant nothing to them.

I have taken up trying to write lyrics and produce music, but I have doubts I'll ever be good enough for that or anything. Even though I'm now at a new church and I still feel excluded, like I don't belong. I'm trying my hardest to make friends and go out, but I struggle constantly, with feeling like no cares about me and feeling so much like a burden.

While I was in that abusive relationship, I got a certificate in web development and looked two years for a job in that field and had no luck (website and everything). Since leaving that relationship I went back to school for a BA in Human Resources. Some family members talk shit in front my face about it and makes me feel like a failure. It just makes me want to give up on life.

Having to overcome sexual assault, abuse, and constantly being denied in the field you wanted to be in is already hard enough. I'm having major doubt 2020 will be a good year. I feel so abandoned by everyone and the only thing I look forward to is just my cat.

I just want to start off saying that since I got my period for the first time nine years ago, I never really had any period cramps. 

Never went through any pain, my life is pretty normal, just bleed for a week once a month and that’s it. I’ve been told by many people that it’s a blessing.

The only one off case was probably last year where I had period cramps for the first time. Horrible, horrendous, terrifying, especially more so because it was assessment week and I spent my time in school the entire time sitting down holding my stomach (it hurts the moment I stood up) and trying to pull through exams. 

I remember popping those menstrual pain relief pills. I’m guilty of taking more than I should but they still don’t work. My life went on smoothly afterwards and pain free during period.

And now it’s finally back again, I really really really reallllllly don’t want to go through the entire process again, especially I got school project to do right now.

I swear my body is really out here accumulating the pain for the past nine years and throwing it all to me.

I’m willing to try any remedy at this point.
Thank you to everyone in advance and have a happy new year!

eifnfd|2020-01-01 07:29:47|I have a plantar wart and I'm severely reminded of the first few times I got my period.|"CW: If you're grossed out really easily, please don't read (describes the removal of skin on wart, period experience).  
I'm honestly not sure if this is the right place for this, but here goes.

  
For those who don't know what a plantar wart is, it's a wart on the bottom of the foot. These past few weeks have been somewhat fine, but it does hurt to walk on so I mostly limp around the house. I've been treating the area with salicylic acid as recommended.

  
So today came the day to remove a layer of dead skin that was covering the wart. I didn't care so much about the skin - it was the sight of the fucking wart that got me. Oh my god, those things are disgusting to look at. I know I sound like a baby because I really am a lil baby bitch when it comes to these things, but after cleaning it and the whole process was done, I'm still shaking. I feel so sick. The image of it keeps popping up in my head, and I can't sleep. I'm just so disgusted and I can't stand myself.

  
I know how weak this sounds, and that's because it is. I've been fortunate enough to have not suffered from a significant injury or any significant illness up to this point in my life, and I know I speak from a place of privilege and probably sound ridiculous.

  
Anyway, when I saw it, I was instantly reminded of how I felt the first few times I got my period. I believe I was 10 years old. And oh my, I was horrifically disgusted by it. I couldn't stand the sight, smell, feeling. I would pee twice a day maximum to reduce the number of times I had to face it. I would hold my breath using the bathroom, and would never look down.

Yesterday was using my dildo (6inch) fairly vigorously on myself and at some point pushed it in deeper.

I felt what I’m pretty sure is my cervix get ‘shifted’ slightly.

Is this normal? I didn’t feel any sharp pains or any discomfort and when I used my dildo again today I felt that my dildo could go deeper than it usually does.

I went to check on my cervix in case I thought something was wrong and I had to put my fingers fairly deep in to the knuckle to feel it. 

Will it move back to its regular position?

Is this something I should be concerned about? I’ve got an IUD which I’ve never been able to feel the string of, but I’m pretty sure I would be able to tell if it comes out since it’s a decent size and shouldn’t just ‘fall out’ since I’ve had it for 3 years.

ei09c8|2019-12-31 08:35:16|Going bra-less!|"I (28F) recently moved from a podunk small, slightly suburban town in Georgia to Denver, Colorado for a new job. My husband and I are absolutely in love with our new city, the culture, the mountains, and most importantly, everyone’s open minded-ness. 

Coming from the south and the Bible Belt in particular, I was raised and always told that women should dress and act a certain way, and I would say my personal style/fashion sense is fairly conservative because of this. 

But when we moved to Denver something in me clicked. Maybe because I’ve seen so many badass women out here rocking their own look? Maybe because I’m done with family or friends telling me how I should look or dress? Regardless of the reason, I have stopped wearing a bra almost completely! Outside of work events, I have gone bra-less for about the last 6 weeks! 

And let me tell you, I have never felt more confident, sexy, proud of myself, and just overall comfortable! Today I wore a slightly fitted sweater and I was embarrassingly nervous to go to the store, thinking I was overly exposed, maybe verging on inappropriate. After my husband convinced me that no one cares about my bra-wearing status (plus he thinks my boobs look great) I went and did my errands and came home so proud of myself, not even noticing or caring what anyone else thought. 

I don’t really have anyone to share my excitement with besides my family back in Georgia, so I just wanted to post this here.  Thank you to all the awesome women in Denver rocking styles and looks, some with bras and some without, for encouraging me to not be ashamed of my body anymore.

It was crazy busy and it was only me and another apprentice who's only been working there for about 5 months. The whole night worked out super well despite being only 2 apprentices and I'm really proud of how we worked together.


So, despite to being very clearly in charge, whenever the head server, a guy from Poland, would come in to explain anything unusual (new table of 6 with 2 children, etc), he would always address my _male_ colleague. You know, the one who's only been there 5 months while I've near the end of my 3 year training? Like, it drove me insane! All I could think of is the meme as in the title. Like, dude, I'm very clearly the more experienced one I charge here. _Talk to me!_ 

I still feel enraged to be honest. It's so infuriating to work so hard and reach a level of respect in the kitchen especially considering it's already overwhelmingly male dominated... And just be overlooked by the restaurant leader because I'm female. I pointed it out to my colleague for him to notice and at the end of the night he was just shocked how much it happened.

I met a girl online and we added each other on Instagram. We went on a date about a week later and things went well. Two days after our date, she mentioned being 'excited' by some of the things I said to her on Snapchat. One big problem: I never added her on Snapchat. I told her this and she was very confused.

Someone used my full name and username from Instagram to create a new Snapchat. He then added her and started talking to her intimately. He convinced her to send naked pictures. 

It seems like it's someone who has been watching her online and keeping track of new followers. She confirmed the user was brand new when he added her (no Snapchat points or whatever they are). 

So far, I have reported the user as an impersonator and she has been guessing at who it could be.

Questions:

1. Is this a form of sexual assault? 
2. What else can be done to punish this person?

ei6fvt|2019-12-31 18:07:39|The Sillim-dong Stalker|"This is a bit old (from May 2019) but I feel like the issue needs to be addressed.

Sillim-dong is considered a ""less expensive"" area of Seoul, where many college kids and youngsters live in apartments alone. So a while back, on Korean websites and social networks, a cctv footage of a woman being followed by a man went viral and the reason it's extremely creepy is because he tried to enter her home by doing absolute batshit crazy things .
 
I won't explain most details of the video as I'll leave a link down below of the footage captured. But I just want to bring up how fricking crazy it is to see him literally take out his phone's flashlight to see the  fingerprints of the girl on her keypad( in most apartments in South Korea, the main way to enter the apt is by a passcode system). Also, the man noticed the camera after a while of loitering outside her place , but he STILL did not stop what he was doing.


Now, what bugs me the most is how so many individuals romanticized the entire incident and called the girl ""stupid"" for not noticing how ""in love"" the man was . 
I read tons of comments in which people attacked the woman for ignoring the guy's ""requests"" . The idiot was LITERALLY trying to break into her home , and had been following her around for 30 minutes . He could've raped her, she could've been robbed and murdered! How in the right mind do you think that stalking is the right way to show your love for someone? I just want to have a discussion on this incident , and I also want to know why a lot of people idealize what the man was doing.

I told him not to contact me again and whatever stuff I had at his house he could donate to Goodwill. After we hung up he sent me a message saying “too bad I will always love you.” A few days later he dropped my stuff off at my apartment, and included a small gift as well. I didn’t hear from him again until tonight, when he texted me to say “happy new year <3 my love.”


He had a violent, volatile temper but never towards me. We dated for two years approximately and during that time he beat up a guy he had an argument with, and slammed into another car in an incident of road rage. I was not in the car at the time. He was never violent/angry towards me until we got into an argument where he was angrier than I had seen him before, screaming at me, which caused me to end the relationship among other things. It had been fading out for a while but that was the final straw for me. 


I am in the USA. I called my state’s domestic violence advocate center and the woman I spoke to told me I should get a restraining order tomorrow. She instructed me not to text my ex, including telling him to leave me alone. She said he is not likely to leave me alone, as he has violated my request for no contact twice at this point. She said I have grounds for a restraining order to be served, and he could be arrested for simply texting me if I get the restraining order in place. I have no way of knowing if he will leave me alone. It is true that he has violated my no contact request twice but he had “excuses” returning my stuff and the new years. He hasn’t been texting me just to say hi or anything like that, so I wonder if he will go back to leaving me alone after this?


I don’t know what to do. I want him to stop contacting me. I want to feel safe in my house, which I currently don’t, because I don’t know if he is going to escalate to coming by/leaving me more presents if I ignore him. But I am also scared that serving him with a restraining order will escalate the situation and that he will hunt me down. He owns guns. I have read “Gift of Fear” which is full of stories of women who were murdered because they took out restraining orders. 


I don’t know what to do and I am scared. Please help. What would you do in my situation?


TLDR; I broke up with my BF of approx. two years, told him not to contact me in any way, he has contacted me twice now, am worried he will continue to contact me, should I get a restraining order or will that needlessly escalate the situation?"|throwaway_52523|False|https://redd.it/eidytw|0|0.5|0|12|1|twoxchromosomes

ehtvvp|2019-12-30 23:11:50|Being hit on in public|"TLDR; A guy read all my 'no' signs after giving me a compliment. We wished each other a good day and that was that. 

So this is something that happened to me this month. Its a small thing really. But I feel the need to get my thoughts out. 

Let me start by saying I'm a bit of a tomboy. I don't dress up much and makeup isn't something I wear often. So I don't get hit on much, let alone out of the blue.

I was in a common area at my hotel during a trip. It was for work so I was wearing makeup like I usually do on these trips and I have to say between dressing up and some makeup I was feeling good. Minding my own business while on my phone, a guy passes me to head for the elevator. 

First, the guy doesn't say anything bad. He just calls me pretty. Which, while I'm still not interested, is flattering. But I'm used to guys being pushy if I'm not very direct. Partially out of respect, I've learned to be more direct, either with words or my everything. If there is no chance then say it flat out/shut everything down. I've given guys and inch and they tried to take a mile. So I react with some kind of non-committal response not even looking his way, keeping myself kind of closed off. 

Part of me was ready for him to try and pester me more, so my defenses were on alert. So I was kind of ready for a fight on it. But instead he just wishes me a good day which I happily return. We stayed in the same hotel for a bit and I even saw him again. But never heard anything out of him again. 

It's something small. It shouldn't matter. But it actually means a lot that it ended that peacefully, because there are a lot of times it doesn't. I didn't have to reassert that I wasn't interested. I didn't have to verbally fight him or get mean. He just paid me a compliment, read that I wasn't interested, and went on his way. I hope one of these days that's something I can come to expect in these situations. 

It was nice. I hope that guy is doing well."|Sudden_Subject|False|https://redd.it/ehtvvp|212|0.89|0|17|1|twoxchromosomes

The  dude here told me “It’s about a 2.5 hour wait as there are six cars ahead of you .” He suggested I go to the first one I went to. So I told him that they only have full synthetic for like $91 and he told me that he was just there this morning knows they have that oil and filter for my car. I was like “I literally just came from there.” So he called as a “customer” came back to me and said they had the lower cost one but thinks they were just trying to take advantage of me because I’m a girl and they thought they could pull that shit. 

Smh some people really. So this dudes gonna try and get me in and out as quick as he can.

ei3lqe|2019-12-31 14:36:56|Problems with mom's boyfriend|"I am sorry in advance for my English, I am not a native speaker. 

  
And, I realize that my name can be confusing in one manner, I am a girl (23yo) and Marius is a character from a book a was reading when created this account.

  
My parents are divorced when I was 2 years old and both of them have a new relationship which I am trying to be supportive as much as I can. Father changed more than one partner during that time, none of them was actually bad to me, only one of them said that I was a very spoiled child(when I was 12yo or so) my father sent her away for it.  
My mother is a different story, she only had one partner and she brings him to our house (and I was living with my mother for most of the year) when I was 8. Ok now, he smokes a lot, he does it inside even though we have a nice and big balcony, during summer and winter. And I have to take anti-allergic drugs even to be able to stay in my mother's home cause of this. 

He drinks a lot and if he is in a good mood while doing so, he just calls me and says how he loves me, etc. but if he is in a bad mood, he keeps shouting at my mother until 7-8 a.m. I was trying to be on my mother's side when they were arguing but that always causes her to be on his side against me so I started to stay silent and stay away from everything. She had a reason to be on his side, cause if I spoke anything bad(or just something non-respectful) he keep blaming my mother for not being able to raise me good enough. If I do something good, he says ""I made you like this, you should be thankful"" and if I do something bad, it is my mother's fault. He keeps seeing his ex-wife saying it is for his daughter (over 30 yo, married and with child) but blame my mother when she likes a post sent by another man on facebook. So she is usually thinking whether he will be angry at her for it or not before doing anything.

  
All of these, I was seeing my mother as ""normal"" and thinking my father is the ""extreme"" one. Some time ago(1-2 months) I read a post here a mother sent about how she broke up with a man who talked ill of her children, and people commenting on how they would do or even did the same thing. My boyfriend kept saying that is wrong(well, he knows more than I write here) and I always thought he was just saying it cause he loves me and knows how much I cry in my room while trying to ignore all the shouting. I thought I was too sensitive about all. But reading how people act in a situation even far less serious, I guess woke me up. I am studying in another country from my parents for 4 years now but this is my first new year I am not with either of my parents. I was thinking about calling my father or how good it would be to be with him for the new year and realized that, I am thinking just about him. Since my childhood, my mother was kind of priority for me. I always wanted to be with her for as long as I can. 

One more thing, this summer, he beat her, he did it while I was sleeping and after a long argument, they had(cause I raised my voice to him while talking). He says it was wrong and told me that he believes I wasn't expecting something like that from him, but I did. That night I was trying to stay awake and listen cause I was scared of him doing anything bad to my mom. It seems I was right... She tried to keep it a secret but it is hard for me to believe she got all these bruises by falling. He beat her with the decorative sword my father bought for me. He expects me to forget, she expects me to forgive. I could forget everything he says about me but I cannot forget that my mother never is on my side, and  I cannot forgive that he beat my mother. I don't think ""it was just once"" or ""he was very angry"" or ""he was drunk"" are excuses.

ei4e05|2019-12-31 15:40:02|For those waiting for things to change and worrying if they ever will|"I blurted out during an argument over the phone today to my mum, that I was raped 10 years ago. It's been on my mind for a while, thinking about this whole decade ending. Of course there were lots of tears and questions, and the horrible feeling of giving someone knowledge that will hurt them. 

However it made me think about how much has changed in 10 years since it happened, and how much I've changed as a person and I thought for anyone who's scared or alone, or has mental health problems, sometimes hearing from the other side can be helpful. So:

10 years ago, at 17, I was raped by two guys from my school. I had severe body image problems, and was already self harming. I had been bullied for years in my previous school (quite physically violent including a punched nose). I had problems maintaining friendships, and spent my last year at school outcast because the two guys who raped me had been calling me a slut around school. I became depressed, and struggled with being suicidal for the next 6 years. 

I was isolated, and had no friends and had generally felt like I didn't fit in in both of my schools. I went to university, and made two of my closest friends to date. One I thought I had a crush on, but when he came out we became best friends. The second took a bit longer to get to know, she was my flatmate for months before we became 90210 buddies and watched it together every night. She slept in my bed most nights for the next two years. Both are still my closest friends almost a decade later and I consider them family.

I entered a 5 year relationship, in which my really sweet boyfriend was also going through depression, leading to a lot of back and forth cruelty and him convincing me that I had a micro-clit/ I would never be able to orgasm. He also insisted I couldn't go backpacking without him (but he didnt' want to go either) because I would come back ""different"". He was controlling in what I wore, how I spoke and demanded that he be the focus of our relationship. Fast forward to now and I'm dating someone who not only knows how to give multiple orgasms, but who has the same desire to go backpacking with me 3/4 months a year, contributes to more than half of the house work, with whom I have two way street where we prioritise each other equally. My ex was a lovely person, and I had convinced myself this meant we were meant for each other. When we broke up I spent 3 months in bed crying. I've realised that someone being nice doesn't make them right for you, and that you \*can\* get that fluttery teenage in love feeling again even after feeling broken.

I gained and lost 10kg several times, finally realising that if I can stop punishing my body for being itself, I will love it no matter what my weight is. This took most of the decade, and it's not that I lost the weight and am happy: I just actually feel happier when I look in the mirror. I'm not perfect and I still can be mean to myself, but my swings seem to have settled and I haven't self harmed in years. I got my first tattoo, followed by another 6. Two I got done in such a rush, and hated them so much I began lasering them ASAP. I spent a year hating my forearms which had these faded large tattoos. I now have the most amazing coverups and I forget that I spent years hating them.

I started my Architecture degree, and after a year in work decided to leave to do interior design (frowned upon by architects). I then left that to do my MA in Spatial Design (where I made my 3rd best friend!) which I spent months trying to explain to family members who thought architecture was the most reputable of my choices. I got into VR, worried that my MA final project would be irrelevant to design, and won a £5k grant for my work that most people in my family didn't think would ever become a paid job. I left to go backpacking after breaking up with my boyfriend, spent 8 months in Asia, met someone who feels like my soulmate and decided to move in together immediately and have been together for a year and 1/2.

My nephew was born shortly after I began therapy (6 years after my rape), both of them helping lift me out of my depression by showing me new ways of looking at life. I began feeling joy, butterflies and excitement about the world which until that point had been so bleak. I started having hobbies again, I learned to crochet, picked up drawing again, started playing video games, started yoga and boxing. 

I got a job at a tech innovation company and started teaching design to 17/18+ year olds, the same age I was at the start of this decade. Watching them go through all the things I did and being able to help them, advise them in ways I wish I had. One of my students was severely depressed and on Xanax, came off it during my time as his teacher and came out of his shell: started smiling, flourished, went from failing to the highest achieving student. Possibly the most rewarding experience of my life.

Looking back, a decade ago I was a child who had been bullied, assaulted, torn down and had no support system. Today, I have a career that allows me flexibility to travel, a partner who supports me and pulls his weight (wow what a low bar to set!), regained my sexuality after therapy, changed career multiple times and am looking to start a PhD. This isn't meant to be me bragging, but a celebration of how much a person can change in a decade. A reminder that time will heal, and even if 10 years feels like a long time, I feel like an entirely different person.

This will pass, and if you let it, life can open up and show you the amazing things that are waiting for you."|triangletalks|False|https://redd.it/ei4e05|7|0.7|0|3|1|twoxchromosomes

My cycle was always really dependable up until the past year -- shortish cycle, probably 25 days, with 2-3 days of moderate bleeding and 2-3 days of light bleeding tapering off after that. Minor cramps at the beginning, for a day.

In recent months, I will start cramping about a week before my period starts. Every freaking day, I'm certain I'm going to start. Pelvic heaviness, cramps, back pain. No bleeding. My period will finally start abruptly after about a week of this bullshit.

My PMS symptoms -- usually impatience, profound gloominess bordering on despair, and munchies -- continue throughout this week of cramps and taper off around the time my period starts.

I'd be interested to hear about how other women's cycles changed around middle age -- did your period get harder to deal with? Easier?"|ms_marc_stavingrad|False|https://redd.it/ei9flm|3|0.55|0|13|1|twoxchromosomes

A few nights ago, it was around 7 pm, not too late but it gets dark pretty early this time of year.I was trying to get to a party but got lost driving there because Google maps is the worst. 
I stop at a gas station and simply sit in my car looking at my map on my phone trying to get back. Some man then pulls up to the pump across from mine and starts talking to the man on the pump next to me. I have a hard time hearing what he says but says some something about ""female in the grey"" ( I was wearing a grey sweater) and that he ""didn't want to alarm him but he should know "" other man says ""shit. Yeah let's bounce"" and all the cars in the station start leaving. I get weird vibes and also decide to leave. 
I go to another gas station where I knew where I was, as I still really needed gas. I get out my car and start pumping gas. I look around, I'm the only one pumping gas. There's people inside the store but no one paying attention out here. I hold my pepper spray in my hand, I start getting a really awful feeling. 
When suddenly a white pickup truck with patches of missing paint on the hood pulls up. The man driving looked about 65, he has brown skinned, had a white mustache. He starts laughing the moment he sees me. He gets out of the car and so do another man, maybe in his 30's, and a woman also. They all look Hispanic and the younger man says in Spanish to the old man, ""if you want, I'll do it."" The old man laughs and says to do it. 
I know Spanish, knew exactly what they said, and without a word, I pull out the gas pump, put back on lid, my hands shaking. I make a rush into my car and lock the doors. The younger man is closer to my car now, like he tried grabbing me before o had made it in my car. I didn't say a word, I didn't look back, I just drove away as quickly as I could. 
I feel like I had been stalked from the previous gas station, and like multiple people were involved. And I probably would have not made it if I didn't know Spanish and if I had stayed there another minute. 
I was terrified. Felt like an organized attack, like sex trafficking. I'm a young female, in my early twenties. Not doubt, seeing me alone, and young made them see me as a vulnerable target.

But I was wondering if wearing makeup is a bad example to younger girls, or reenforcing that they have to wear it to look good. I noticed that most women on tv wear a lot of makeup to look attractive, where it seems that guys on tv are more accepted for their natural attractiveness, which I notice spills over irl. Basically I wouldn’t want to reinforce people thinking that they have to match an “after” picture naturally to look good.

Me (17f) and my parents are on vacation in Asia to enjoy the food and visit family, together with my boyfriend (17m). My boyfriend worked hard to save up for this trip, and finally, that dream came true!

We first went on a car trip, and we planned on being away from the city for 2 nights. Unfortunately, I got sick the first night, so we had to cancel the rest of the trip and get back to the city to let me rest.

That other night, my mother got food poisoning. When I thought it couldn't get worse, my dad, of course, had to make the whole thing horrible with his moodswings.

For some reason, he got mad at mom. Now he is sulking in his bed, feeling sorry for himself and of course do the silent treatment, and my mom have to take care of him and go out and buy him food to bring to the hotel, because he's too moody and passive to do it himself.

Now, I would love to enjoy this last day of 2019, maybe with a walk in the city with my boyfriend. But no, I'm not allowed to go anywhere outside of this hotelroom, and me, boyfriend and my parents all share room.

ehzjgf|2019-12-31 07:11:37|Why must anything to do with vehicles be super frustrating to deal with as a woman?|"The previous post about a woman dealing with shop's lies while trying to get her oil changed has me all riled up. I started to write this story as a comment and realized it needed its own thread.

This fall I needed to fix my rear suspension while on the road driving cross country. I had airbag suspension in the rear and Toyota wanted about 1000$ and two months+ to fix it. The tech on the phone actually laughed at me when I asked how long ordering the clips and hosing to replace the air lines would take... Toyota is having one hell of a year in Canada, so I can understand, but that was a bit much. Also I didn't have the time for that bs. I was already driving on the bump stops at times as my air suspension was shot and leaking. I said no thanks and decided to do a swap to coils, myself, since it's not too complicated and I had the necessary tools and help while visiting friends. We had to DIY some isolators out of boat/trailer parts, but it works. Plus now I have a 3 inch lift in the rear. Also fixed my muffler issue while I was under there. The internet is a magical place, friends. 

To get the coils ordered, I visited EIGHT shops/warehouses in Regina, SK.

EIGHT places of men telling me they didn't think it was possible (it is), they didn't have the parts (they did), they couldn't do the swap for me (I asked them to order the coils for me so I could do the swap myself), or that they couldn't help me with anything - let me reiterate that I walked into every one of these shops with the brand and part number, and alternates in case they didn't carry/couldn't order what I wanted. NEVER once asked for help with anything, just wanted to order a part. One man got so upset with me he yelled at me. He was red in the face, telling me that he couldn't help me with picking out anything or doing the labour, I replied that I the only thing I'd asked for was him to order a part for me. 

My friend's husband went into a shop and within two minutes had the part ordered. To be fair to the final shop, once the owner realized the part was for me, he seemed confused. I explained to him what had happened and why'd we'd gone for that tactic. He was shocked. He didn't have the part himself, but he called a couple of the shops I'd been to already because he knew they either carried or had access to ordering it. He ended up ordering the part I needed through one of the places I'd already visited, because I refused to go back to the shop. They regularly order parts for him, and they also order parts for DIYers. He didn't charge me a surplus for being the middle man, but I would have happily paid at that point. 

This whole debacle took three days to find a shop to order the part from. TWO DAYS WASTED because of men's deliberate and uncalled for misogyny. wtf."|random_assortment|False|https://redd.it/ehzjgf|18|0.7|0|10|1|twoxchromosomes
eifyle|2020-01-01 08:07:27|My (21F) male friend (27M) sexually assaulted me|"Last night I (21F) went out with a group of friends for a fun time at a bar in a nearby city. I was particularly close with one guy, let's call him Nate (27M). I live in a city about 1.5 hours away, so I was going to have to sleepover Nate's, which was usually the plan whenever I came into the city. There was never any sexual chemistry as far as I could recall, especially last night due to me having a boyfriend. 

There was a lot of drinking especially on Nate's end. I stopped drinking around 11:30 pm and sobered up a bit. the rest of my friends stopped drinking and had already headed back home. So at this time, it's just me and Nate. he's flirting with other girls and I'm just socializing with other people. Time passes and it's about 1:30 and so me, Nate and some of the people that were mutual friends with our group also came along. We hop bar to bar to try to find an open place in the area but after 15 mins or so we finally found a dive bar. There Nate orders 3 drinks, 2 drafts for him and one for me. I drink some more and as does he. We leave to get some food and come back and he drinks some more. We ended up leaving around 3 AM and we get a taxi. He's still very drunk at this point. When we get inside the taxi, he holds my hand which I'm like whatever at that point as I knew that it wasn't romantic. I then start eating some chips that we had gotten earlier and I sorta feed him the chips which I don't know why I did that. He also outs his hand around my shoulder and sort of kisses my nose and we were both like what the fuck and he then says let's pretend that never happened in disbelief with himself. I thought we were heading back to his place but he was telling the driver some directions and we end up at another bar. He orders another 2 orders of beer and I order him two glasses of water as he claimed that he couldn't properly see anymore, blurry vision. He then randomly starts giving me a neck massage, which I just dismissed. I tell him to drink the water and he chugs them both down really fast and then proceeds to head out with a draft in hand. Walking back, we were holding hands but for me, I was doing it more like a mother holding a child's hand so it wouldn't run off and do anything stupid. Some guy ran into him spilling his drink and I made sure to calm him down before he did anything violent as I could sense his tone and manner was very upset. I squeeze his hand and pull him away, and he says that if it weren't for me being here, he would be making some very poor life choices, which may or may not be true at this point. He then proceeds to hit his hand on the loading ramp of a truck passing by. I apologize and as we walk away he proceeds to shout out expletives. I tried to shush him and as we walk back to his place, he starts talking about his love life and how in general, much of an asshole or a bad person he was. He was suppressing his emotions and his issues but some of it slip throughout the night. I felt bad and tried to console him and give him advice. He was talking about being an awful human being already earlier too when we were alone getting food to eat and such. As we were walking back he asks if I would eat a whole pizza right now and I told him I would. He then says he thinks that he ends up taking a girl home and some pizza, he has had a goodnight. At that time I had no idea what he was talking about. 

We get to his place and he lets go of my hand. Once in the apartment, I proceeded to sleep on the couch and he decided to play some video games. I kept reminding him that he had to get ready for work in a few hours as it was almost 4 am. He then sits on the couch I was laying on and rubs my calves. I tried to fall asleep but then he stops playing his game and proceeds to go back to his room to sleep. He suggests to me to sleep in the same bed and I give him a look and he then says he won't try to do any funny business. I tell him to at least change his clothes since it was doused in beer from earlier. I head to his room and we start to cuddle. After a bit, he starts to grab me and intertwine his legs with mine which I didn't like and had to move my legs away. At this point, I was just really tired and just wanted to go to bed. I also didn't know what to do. Later on, he tries getting me to face him and when I finally do, he tried to kiss a few times but I ducked and was like what the fuck to him. I think I also stayed in bed because I felt bad as I knew he was in an emotional state. I turned away facing the wall. He then grabs my stomach and hold me and places his hands along the tops of my pants and tries to put his hands down at both front and back throughout the night. Also during this time, I get really scared like having the thought of what is he gonna do, is he gonna try and push himself onto me. at one point he sais that I seduced him and I was like what are you talking about, just hours ago you were telling someone else that I was like the little sister you never had. Throughout the night he nuzzles me my neck and nibbles at my ear. I wake him up before 7 for work and he goes back into bed continuing to hold me and trying to put his hands down my pants to grab my ass and up my shirt to get under my bra. I get his hands off me but he still is holding my waist and arm around my neck in a way. I can't go back to bed and so I get ready and leave. I think he was still sort of drunk as he did drink an inordinate amount of alcohol. At this time I was getting good morning messages from my boyfriend who was also in the same city to see his friends.

I felt really bad as I had actually introduced my boyfriend to Nate that night earlier via facetime. 

As I head back home on the bus, Nate then apologizes for what he did and that he really doesn't remember everything that has happened. I tell him everything and he then profusely apologizes that he ""disrespected me, my relationship and made me uncomfortable"". Later on, I told him I need some time, not like a year but just some time and we will not be drinking together anytime soon. I told him too that I understand how he was feeling last night but it wasn't right too. I think last night I had Stockholm syndrome.  

Hours pass and I feel bad about myself. I feel really guilty about what happened and I haven't told my boyfriend nor do I want to, especially since he already knew about Nate and that we would drink and go out a  fair amount. But I also feel empty in a way. When I read about victims of sexual harassment and abuse, one of the reactions is feeling empty. I also regret not staying over my boyfriend's airbnb that night when he had offered. I didn't take up his offer because Nate's place was closer to the bus station for going back home. I also feel different too. My boyfriend had called me and I could hear myself sounding bothered and not right. And so now I'm worried that this is going to affect my relationship. 

also, I'm not going to be pressing any charges, I just want to forget what happened after we left the first bar.

This also isn't my first time being sexually assaulted by a former male friend before. Although last time, we were both drinking a lot and there was actual intercourse. I won't call it rape for my own sanity but I will say I was taken advantage of while being extremely intoxicated and even telling him hours before I wasn't interested in him. That male friend and I are no longer friends and actually I stopped talking to him two days later. During that time I didn't have a boyfriend and I didn't have sex for a month following that incident. 

**TLDR; male friend sexually groped me and now I feel weird and empty and I think it is going to affect my relationship with my boyfriend who doesn't know.**"|scaredThrow98|False|https://redd.it/eifyle|0|0.35|0|0|1|twoxchromosomes

3. Something... something... ungrateful.... something... I’m cutoff (even though I’m not the one who instigated the blowup). To be fair, this one is muddled by Xanax. 

So I escaped to bf’s aunt’s Christmas last minute, and she assured me that I was always welcome to come. She’s very sweet. And a few days later bf’s mom found out what happened at my Christmas and was... angry(?) that didn’t tell her how psychotic my brother was?!?!? 

This woman was legitimately upset that I’ve “misled” her about my family. Which I do not understand. I am very open about how psychotic he is. I have never sugarcoated anything he’s done or said. On the flip side, she’s always excused him with “he’s still a kid” and “he doesn’t really mean it”. And now she’s run out of defenses? Idk.

I have been married for about 4.5 years and have been together about 7. 
Every time we have intercourse it’s like sticking a white hot poker in me and pulling it in and out. We’ve tried everything to warm up, different positions, and nothing seems to help. I have 0 sex drive because I know how bad it’s going to hurt. I’ve had no trauma down there so I’d don’t understand why it’s happening. I’ve seen many doctors, one diagnosed endometriosis and did surgery. Then put me on lupron (to induce artificial menopause). Nothing happened. Another said I would have to use a steroid cream, nothing happened. 
I always urinate right after and it just BURNS after. I’ve never had an STD but I can imagine this is what the burning sensation while urinating feels like. 

Has anyone dealt with this and can provide some insight or point me in a direction? Maybe something I can provide to a doctor to guide me?

Be grateful that I have a beating heart, able body and mind to be able to change whatever circumstance that I’m in. If I’m not happy, there are things I can do to begin the journey towards my happiness. Of course it’s not going to be easy. Climbing upwards will always require effort. But first, I need to want to be happy. I need to want to get out of my situation. Being unhappy can be comforting because there’s a fear of the unknown. But that’s life. No matter what your situation is, it can change. Honestly, be grateful you have a beating heart, able mind...now, you just need the desire to change it. If you don’t have the desire to change it, maybe you’re ok with being depressed...and if you’re content with being unhappy, how will you ever achieve happiness?

I feel like I have to pee most of the time and it becomes very urgent to even if i literally just peed. I feel like I need to pee even right after I pee. I can’t even comfortably lay in bed because I just feel like I need to pee and am getting up every minute. It’s extremely hard to go on car rides because just after a short period of time I need to pee really bad and we don’t want to stop at a gas station every little bit. Right now even i’m just laying in bed feeling like I need to pee bad when in the last 30 minutes i’ve probably gotten up to go to the bathroom 15-20 times. I will start counting how much i pee a day but i wouldn’t be surprised if it was 100 times or more seeing as how in just 30 mins I have to pee that many times. I have been taking medicine that is supposed to help and make me pee less and not have to pee after but it isn’t working all that well. It’s also ruining my sex life as when his penis hits against my bladder (which like sticks out more than it should for some reason it didn’t used to) and then i feel like i need to pee and it hurts and then he will keep going and it just hurts badly because he’s pressing against my bladder than i then feel like i have to pee. I used to be able to just have regular sex and live a more regular life but this is really bringing me down. I already have a lot of other problems but this is the hardest to deal with. It honestly makes me have suicidal thoughts because I don’t see why I’m alive just to have to pee ALL THE FUCKING TIME. all i do is irritate people with how much bathroom stops i have to make and all that. my boyfriend does not understand and he thinks i’m just not attracted to him anymore and that’s why i’m having problems with sex. i try to explain but he thinks i’m like lying and he doesn’t understand. Is there a type of surgery I can get to fix this? Or what can I do? Someone please tell me what I can do to fix this i’m literally desperate. I often cry because of this and I think it’s a horrible way of life it’s become a huge problem and I don’t know what to do.

I'm wondering if anyone has used a menstrual cup who struggled with vaginal pain. I have gotten a lot better: worked through pain that I used to experience with penetrative sex and using tampons, but the insertion of what seems like a bulky oddly shaped thing makes me worried. I do still experience pain, especially with cardboard tampons or tampons without an inserter.

 I'd love to make the switch and use less waste. Has anyone with similar problems tried this? What was your experience?"|communaltherapy|False|https://redd.it/ei8fue|1|0.57|0|1|1|twoxchromosomes

eiavxd|2019-12-31 23:50:57|I’m really tired of being a girl and always being scared.|"I’m 99% sure I was almost kidnapped/sex trafficked today. 

I’m 19. My mom had to stop at the mall, but I didn’t want to go in due to traumatic memories of the place. 

Brief info for anyone who’s curious, if not you can skip: A few years ago, I was there with a friend and we heard gunshots. Everyone panicked and ran out, it was chaos. We found out that it was only a dispute between three people, but of course we all assumed it was a mass shooting. I was still scarred from the experience and didn’t want to go back in that mall.

So, I waited in the car. The mall is in a downtown area and the parking lot was next to a parking garage. It was kind of deserted other than someone walking in or out of the mall every few minutes.

After about ten minutes of waiting, I saw a man on the sidewalk about 20 feet away staring at me. He was also texting on his phone. He kept looking from me to his phone. This went on for about five more minutes and I kept getting more and more scared as I wondered what the hell he was doing, before I got out of the car and speed walked into the mall. As soon as I got out of the car and headed towards the mall, he also went towards the same entrance. I was freaked out but it was very close so I knew I’d be able to make it. 

I don’t know if that was the right decision to make. After it all happened, I told my mom and she told me I should have stayed in the car. But I was scared. I felt helpless just sitting there and I was wondering if any second this guy was going to try to break in the car or if more guys would show up. I keep thinking that if this guy decided to run towards me or I tripped, who the fuck knows where I would be right now.

After I got in the mall, he was following me. I was literally walking in circles calling my mom trying to figure out where she was while he watched from a distance. I went into GameStop, still on the phone with my mom, and he followed me in there. I exited the store and went to where my mom was, the creepy guy following me the whole way. He shortly left after I found my mom and realized I wasn’t alone. 

This wasn’t even the first time something like this happened to me. Not even two months ago, I had to take an overnight greyhound alone and be picked up by my friend at the station at 4am. When she told me she was almost there, I went to the door to wait for her. This guy asked if I needed an Uber, I said no, then he was pacing around me and frantically texting on his phone, gradually getting closer to me and the door. If my friend had been a minute later I honestly think he would have grabbed me since the door was right there. When I got outside, I saw another car in the parking lot with a guy inside of it on his phone, probably who the guy inside was texting.

Or maybe I’m just paranoid, but we kind of have to be as women. 

I’m tired of this. I honestly wish I had been born a boy so I never had to go through anything like this and don’t feel so defenseless. The average man can easily overpower the average woman. And I know this stuff does occasionally happen to men, but at least they have a fighting chance. Women are basically fucked if a guy decides they want to hurt us/kidnap us/overpower us.

Literally, what can I do to be safe? Always be with someone else at every moment I’m in public? I shouldn’t have to be.

I’m considering buying a handgun when I turn 21 and getting a CC permit. That wouldn’t even 100% guarantee my safety though. If someone snuck up on me, I’d be fucked.

But wait, there’s a bonus, it could help my other fear too! If I’m ever stuck in a mass shooting, maybe I could stop it. Yay. God, I really hate this world. I’m tired of always being scared."|greencat41|False|https://redd.it/eiavxd|0|0.46|0|14|1|twoxchromosomes
ei7ou7|2019-12-31 19:37:23|Losing a friend|"Soo... I am one of those people who don't really have friends or partners 'cause I guess I am a loser. I have, however, a strong interest in exercise and am very Active in a certain fitness-club. Two years ago, I met this woman at the fitness-center and we became very, very Close friends. We shared the interest in exercising and met up to train 3-4 times a week. We shared coffees. We traveled abroad. I helped with several of her professional and otherwise Projects. We discussed her eating disorder and other Health issues at length (important)

And then she met a guy on Tinder and they became very in love. But we continued to hang out, and I honestly don't Think that would've affected our relationship too much in the long run, because we were that Close. But it coincided in time with the Thing that happened. So, I turned ""old"" and at that age you get a complimentary screening mammogram (my friend is 9 years younger than I). And they found something on the mammogram and it turned into an ultralsound and a biopsy, that I would have to wait a week to get the answer to. Naturally, I was completely out of my mind with anxiety. It was the worst week of my Life (so far). And naturally I turned to my friend to get emotional support, like I had given her on many occasions Before. I told her on a Monday. And I got this Cold, stand-offish response, like ""oh, that's bad"". And nothing more. 

And then I didn't hear from her after that. On Wednesday, I got the biopsy results stating that it was a benign thing in my boob. And I messaged my friend these happy news. And I Heard nothing from her. I waited the whole week, and nothing. The next Monday, we met again at the fitness-center, and she was all, oh, good thing it wasn't malignant.

I was absolutely destroyed by her disinterest. I asked why she never replied to my message and she said 'I Think I did' but of course that could be proven false. And then I said I had to Think things over, and I just left.

And we have not had Contact in 2 months. We have met twice at the center and IGNORED each other like morons. After the last instance, I blocked her on social media (but she has my phone and e-mail).

Well, I am lonely and miserable as ever. I Believe I could still reach out to her and fix it, but I feel so betrayed by how Little she seemed to care about me potentially having cancer. 
I cannot stop missing her, but I cannot just forget how she made me feel. I have had to start training at a different location just to not run into her and have to ignore her like a 4-year-old.

It is all very hard. I want her to apologise, but sometimes I Think it would be Worth having an un-trustworthy friend just to not be alone.

Thoughts? 
Sorry for the length of this. Happy New Year!"|NucleusTS|False|https://redd.it/ei7ou7|1|0.6|0|2|1|twoxchromosomes
ei7idh|2019-12-31 19:24:17|fashion advice/blogs/subreddits for a 23y/o young professional?|"Hi, not 100% sure this is the right subreddit for this, but I wanted advice from other women.   
Does anybody have any recommendations for blogs/subreddits/instagrams for fashion advice for mid-range sized people who want to look stylish but not like, over the top? I've always been kind of trendy but in a basic way. Due to my short height and wide hips I always feel like if I don't wear skin tight clothing I look frumpy, but when I wear skin tight clothing I feel like I am dressing younger...

Following more fashion blogs now but most of the people I've found are pretty thin - nothing wrong with that, but I'm definitely more sturdy and pear shaped. Also, when I googled ""how to dress if pear shaped"" I just got a lot of really articles with really outdated advice based around de-emphasizing your butt (thanks, 90s).   


Also, I work full time in an office, so trying to figure out how to dress like an adult but also be trendy and have clothing that is versatile for work and play is a bit confusing for me.   


Any advice would be helpful!"|garbage_gemlin|False|https://redd.it/ei7idh|1|0.67|0|1|1|twoxchromosomes
