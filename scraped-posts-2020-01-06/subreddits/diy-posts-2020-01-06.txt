ekuvis|2020-01-06 14:32:57|Perfection is the enemy of done -- questions about subfloor under hardwoods.|"New house.  We're changing 2 bedrooms from carpet to hardwoods to match the rest of the house.  With carpet removed, there is ½"" particle board on top of 3/8"" plywood, attached to floor joists of first floor over basement.  Apparently all of the current hardwoods also used to be carpeted areas, and when the hardwoods were installed, they just laid 3/8"" plywood over that particle board.  That means it's floor joist/3/8"" plywood/1/2"" particle board/3/8"" plywood subfloor.  In order to have the bedroom floors match the same height as the hallway, we either need to do the same, or remove the particle board and lay 1 1/8"" plywood over the lower plywood.  My husband would really like to do that, and I understand that strictly speaking, that's the proper approach, but I think at this point it's overkill.  These other floors have been in place for 20 years, there's no squeak, no buckling, no problem, and if they'd done these bedrooms at the same time, they've have been done the same way.  And yes, we will also be putting resin paper under the planks. But otherwise the paralysis by analysis has kept us from moving forward at all, and we're dragging into 6 months with 2 mortgages (obviously there's other stuff in play besides these floors).  

So boiling it down:  1) is it absolutely horrifying to think that we'd just lay down more plywood rather than removing the particle board; and 2) what kind and size of hardware should we use to lay whatever subfloor we put down -- ring nails/screws/staples?"|witsendstrs|False|https://redd.it/ekuvis|124|0.92|0|21|1|diy

I sanded the pieces, used plastic adhesion promoter, and then I lightly sprayed about 3 top coats of Rustoleoum (says Also bonds to plastic!) with about 15 minutes in between each coat.

I haven't done the clear coat yet. I've read a lot of mixed things on it. Some people say to sand the final top coat, then clear coat, then sand that clear coat. Others say just clear coat and if its shiny, you're done. Others say clear coat, sand it, and clear coat again, and sand it.

What's the best way to go about this? I was going to just lightly clear coat and let it set up for an hour and see how it looks, then maybe use some sandpaper, and then buff out the scratches with maguars ultimate compound. I'd really prefer to just clear coat and hope it turns fine. It's a satin clear coat with satin paint, so, not semi-gloss or gloss."|1001Lives|False|https://redd.it/ekvreq|4|0.72|0|7|1|diy
ekx253|2020-01-06 17:17:24|Guinea pig cage table diy|"Hi new to sub and on mobile so apologies for formatting issues.

I have 3 guinea pigs, 2 girls one boy so 2 cages. I am moving the girls inside and ideally would like to put the cages on top of each other but they are not structurally designed for this. 

My idea is to build a sort of table which I can have one cage under and one on. I would like to use plywood and like posts to make this. The cages are  in cm 100 by 54 so would make the table 100 by I think 65 to have enough clearance for the legs and putting the cage in and out.

I think having the board with the posts screwed in the corners would work however I am not knowledgeable in this area. Is this to simplistic to work? 

I would like to rotate who is on top but the guineas themselves don't weigh much. The cages are plastic and probably a few pounds along with a few pounds of sawdust, their food, veg, water and hay are the only other things in the cage so would the table be strong enough with a post at each corner or would it be better with more?

Any additional advice welcome and please be honest if I my idea is ridiculous."|carok045|False|https://redd.it/ekx253|5|0.78|0|0|1|diy

ekuu7j|2020-01-06 14:29:55|Want to make sure I'm not going to burn down my house|"Hi, first time poster on this subreddit so I hope this question is appropriate for here.

I'm getting a gas stove installed to replace an electric one and needed to install a new 110V outlet behind the stove cavity which I believe is only used to power the clock, oven light and igniter. We have an existing over-the-range microwave, so obviously my easiest course was to run wire from the microwave's outlet a few feet directly down the wall without having to mess with crossing between studs. The microwave is on it's own 20A circuit, and I did a bit of research on whether adding an outlet for a gas stove specifically (given it's low power draw) on its circuit was within code or not but found a lot of conflicting answers. The microwave is 1000W with a 14 amp rating, so I decided to do it because there was really no other option if I wanted to DIY and it seemed there should be enough bandwidth to handle it. I used 12 gauge wire, installed everything seemingly correctly, tested the new outlet and it worked fine.

Then the next day I noticed that the under-microwave light and fan buttons were acting strange. The microwave itself worked fine and no issues with the display or interior light. But I'd push the fan or light button and it might turn it on, but the next push would be unresponsive. But the weird thing is that I could turn on the microwave for a second, then press the fan or light again and it would work at least for a few seconds to be able to cycle it to low/off. Because of that weird fluke where I could get those buttons to work intermittently and the fact that the microwave itself had no issues, I convinced myself that maybe the microwave's circuit board had simply gone bad and the timing was coincidental. After all, the microwave is at least 12 years old and they don't make them like they used to. 

However, yesterday we put the new stove in place and plugged it into my newly-installed outlet, and all of a sudden the microwave light and fan work flawlessly again. No responsiveness issues, no having to trick them into working, all of a sudden just like new. So now I'm wondering if I've done something wrong with my wiring as why would the fan/light issues be instantly resolved as soon as we plugged something in to the 2nd outlet?

If anyone can offer me an explanation as to what might cause this it would make me feel a whole lot better. Thanks!"|SJ_One|False|https://redd.it/ekuu7j|3|0.81|0|7|1|diy

This weekend I had issues trying to climb at night (since climbing on the wall made noise through the floor joists).

So I decided to take down my wall and move it to my garage side room. 

I didn't want to spend more money on new joists, so I repurposed my 45 degree wall joists.

The issue is that the ceiling board (which the joists secured to) was level with the ground, and my new ceiling is at 10 degrees.   So, I had to re-cut all 7 joists, which wouldn't have been so bad, except I had to hand cut the new angles.  Took much effort.

ekj3wi|2020-01-05 21:05:53|Want to build and automated hydroponic/aquaponic environment and looking for some advice|"I wanted to build an [Automatic watering system / controlled environment for aquaponics/ hydroponics](https://i.imgur.com/3nMn7Hg.jpg) It'll be my first project but I wanted to make sure I get an idea of what the best hardware to use might be so I don't have to keep purchasing more major components as I expand. I would prefer to buy slightly larger control hardware to allow for expansion later on. As far as this goes I was thinking a raspberry pi for control. It will potentially have a lot of sensors as I want to control the environment as well as the water level. This would include 2x solenoids, 2x water lever sensor, 1 x heat mat control,1 x humidity, 1x fan and perhaps a servo to open and close the environment to let fresh air in and out and this would be per grow bed. I could have up to 4-6 grow beds (so multiple them parts by 4 or 6) and it would also need to control 1 x pump and monitor a pressure sensor on the pump too.

I will just start out small eg getting solenoids to open and close, pump to run and then getting it all to work together and slowly begin to integrate other components. 

lt won't be anything crazy in size - max piping will be 10mm ID (~3/8""), max head will be maybe 1.2m (4') and the idea behind the pressure sensor after the pump and the solenoid before the pump is to keep the line charged when it is not in use and use the drop in pressure from the open solenoid at the grow bed to trigger the system to start pumping again.

If you could give me an idea on what components I should be looking at or perhaps similar systems others have designed that might be good to look at it would be appreciated.

I've done a fair bit of looking myself but I thought perhaps the hive mind or people who are a little more experienced maybe able to help me whittle down the options a bit as it is quiet overwhelming knowing where to begin.

ekgz1p|2020-01-05 18:37:08|DIY plaster demo and lead paint|"My home was built around 1922 and I'm sure the plaster/lath walls, door, and window trim have at least one layer of lead paint somewhere under the current paint.

I'm considering doing the demo myself and am looking for thoughts on approach and risk.

I have a HEPA shop vac that uses bags, has a HEPA filter between the bag and blower, and also has a HEPA filter on the exhaust port. I'd also pickup disposable coveralls and an appropriate respirator and goggles. I'm also considering buying a HEPA air scrubber for around $1300 CAD to vent out the window and create negative pressure in the room.

With the above equipment my approach would be to cover the floors in cardboard (impact protection), then a layer of thick plastic (dust capture.) Cover the air vent, and create a sort-of ""double door"" entryway to the room where I could suit up and suit down, with some kind of framing and plastic sheets.

The plan is to tear out the plaster and lath, dispose of all wood trim and baseboards, possibly spray foam exterior walls, then put up drywall and new trim.

If I can successfully do one room, I'll probably do the others, so I'm happy to pay for the necessary equipment because I'll still come out ahead of paying a remediation contractor.

Would my approach sufficiently reduce risk of exposure and home contamination? Any other considerations?

Also, are there typically toxic waste disposal restrictions for plaster coated in lead paint?

EDIT:  
Worth noting, for an unrelated issue a contractor took a single, substantial sample from a plaster/lath wall elsewhere in the house that came back negative for asbestos."|Duke_|False|https://redd.it/ekgz1p|2|0.67|0|2|1|diy

It was going perfect and we loved it until this morning when we realized it was sagging in the middle. When we removed our mattress we discovered the middle support beam that runs from the headboard to the footboard was basically twisted out of place (it’s also the same beam that 3 legs attach to). I went back to the reviews and while it has good ratings, this is a common problem some people have had. We contacted the company and they’re sending a replacement piece for us but my question is.. is there a way to reinforce the bed or should we cut our losses now and get a refund?

My idea was placing some wood pieces under the beam to give it more support but I’m in no way DIY savvy when it comes to this type of thing so I’m unsure if this would actually help.

We’ve had some water ingress in our garage and cellar last year. We’ve since resolved the ventilation issue in this area and are in the process of rectifying the drainage as well.

However we’ve had a lot of efflorescence showing up on the bricks now that we’re in a severe drought:

[https://imgur.com/gallery/wvF8qaZ](https://imgur.com/gallery/wvF8qaZ)

We’re wondering what’s the best way to clean this from the bricks? Some websites mentioned to use acid based efflorescence remove such as this:

[https://www.bunnings.com.au/crommelin-4l-efflorescence-remover\_p0960128](https://www.bunnings.com.au/crommelin-4l-efflorescence-remover_p0960128)

However I’m wondering is this going to be corrosive to the brickworks? Especially when the building itself is really old, which was built in the 1950s. Also, using acid based solutions means I need to mix it with water, but excessive moisture and drying out is what’s causing the efflorescence to appear in the first place. So it seems counter intuitive to introduce more of this into the bricks.

Some videos I saw mention I can just scrub away the efflorescence away with a dry wire brush, would this be the best method? Since this is just wiping away the salt layer on the outside, and not treating the source, I’m not sure how effective this will be.

Also, other than rectifying ventilation and drainage issues I’ve mentioned previously, what else can we do to help reduce efflorescence from showing up?

I want to remove an electric heater from my basement that is wired directly to the circuit breaker panel, and am not planning to replace it with anything else for now. The wire to the heater is loose along my basement wall, so my plan was:

1. Turn off power to circuit breaker panel!
2. Disconnect the wiring from the heater (after confirming the wire is dead)
3. Remove the circuit breaker from the panel and replace it with a blank/filler plate
4. Pull the wire out from the ceiling (unfinished basement)

[Photos of heater/wiring/panel](https://imgur.com/a/tsf4Cqh)

In my research I found videos about how to disconnect an electric heater, but only from the wall and not from the breaker panel side. I also saw how to replace a circuit breaker on the panel. The example for how to remove one that I found only showed 2 wires, and mine has 3 (positive/negative/ground, I think). 

My questions: what is the best way to find the wires that connect to the breaker from inside the panel? Once the wires are removed do I tighten the screws with no wire attached? What is the best practice for how to label the empty one on my circuit breaker panel inside cover?

The plastic ones work most of the time, but sometimes they don't. When they fail, they crush as I'm inserting them into the hole of the proper diameter. This action then increases the size of the hole by crumbling all the plaster around it. I don't understand how, when hanging curtains just now for example, 7 go in perfectly fine and then the 8th causes a huge problem. 


The expanding ones don't distribute the load broadly enough such that the force necessary to contract the length, and thereby expand the wings, is too much for the wall to take and the whole thing effectively countersinks into the wall. 


The metal drill-in ones work great on the drywall but in the plaster walls, they don't bite in, rather they basically excavate all the plaster and I'm left with a useless, monster hole in the wall.

The guy who sold me the top coat told me to use a 4"" whizz flock roller for large surfaces and a nylon&polyester brush for small surfaces and edges.

Poured the top coat into a plastic liner in a tray, started rolling and there were all these short hairs showing up.  Cursed to myself, wiped off the hairs and top coat, made sure the surface was clean.

Thought maybe my tray was dirty, so I switched out the plastic liner and did a fresh pour.  Also used a new roller just in case the first one had hair on it from the initial liner&pour.  However, with a new roller, liner, pour, and a clean surface the same hairs showed up again.  To see if the type of roller was to blame, I cleaned the surface and used a brush instead.  Now, with my brush I got hairs a bit longer, and even a red one and a blue one.

I’m buying my first house with my girlfriend and one of the main issues we have found is the kitchen floor.  We pulled back two layers of retro vinyl flooring to find a damp concrete floor. 

The house is a very old (roughly 1900) Victorian terrace. One surveyor advised us that it is likely there is no damp proof membrane in the house and we would have to dig up the concrete floor to fix this. We got another opinion from an architect who said there probably isn’t a DPM but that’s not the biggest issue. He said it should be ok to lose the vinyl and put some breathable tiles down so the water can escape. 

After watching some YouTube videos of liquid DPMs being put down it raised another question. If I put a DMP over the concrete floor, followed by tiles, would this not cause the water to go into the walls as it has nowhere else to go?

Do I need to lose the concrete floor altogether and put down limecrete?

I’m up for giving this a go but need advice on what exactly I should be giving a go.  

All advice much appreciated.

&#x200B;

I've made only a few knives and a friend asked for these blades to be made for one of her employees. The employee's Grandfather owned a Coal mine in Virginia, and apparently he passed away on her birthday not too long ago. My friend was able to get a chunk of the coal from this mine, and deliver to me to figure out how to render into a scale.

The steel is AEB-L I shaped using a Port-a-band, then sent to Peters Heat Treat pre-bevel grinds.

Once I received them back from Peters, I did the Primary Bevel grinds and then on to hand sanding.

While hand sanding I used Gesswein DieMaker stones to get thru the deep scratches from the belt sander quicker, and then finished off with 600 grit sandpaper wet with Windex. Probably should have gone finer, but ah well..

With the coal I ground to coarse bits with a mortar and pestle and bought some resin cast molds from Amazon. I cast in 2 part Alumilite clear inside a Harbor Freight 99$ Pressure pot @ 50 PSI overnight. This is my first time casting anything, and I'm reading that overnight was unnecessary.

To shape the coal resin, I mainly used my port-a-band. I have some aluminum blocks to fence the coal to the width and height of the maple burl. I did the same with the Copper sheets. I then took those same aluminum blocks, wrapped them in wax paper, and epoxied, and clamped the pieces to make the individual scales.

After that I roughed up the material, I get the top of the scale, the piece that sits next to the plunge line, to a finished state, and epoxied the scales to the knife. I used the 2x72, and a spindle sander to shape the scales.

Then sand dry to 2000 grit and finish the scales with white compound and a dremel buffer. I didn't use any oils to treat the wood, since it's all stabilized.

For the cutting edge, i ground the bulk of it on the belt grinder, and finished up with the Wicked Edge at 1600 ceramic.

This is my first DIY post if its not obvious, so my apologies if it's not up to the proper guidelines. Also, I'm only a hobbyist knifemaker, any criticism, tips or otherwise is appreciated."|radr3j|False|https://redd.it/ejlyjh|20|0.72|0|7|1|diy

ejjfef|2020-01-03 18:26:20|Code concerns removing redundant wall switch from circuit with pull chain light socket?|"Subject TL;DR here. But essentially with some recent shenanigans I am considering slightly tweaking a circuit that is passing through our unfinished garage. Currently the circuit comes into the garage to a bog standard light switch than that goes up and controls a light socket with a pull chain center ceiling which also has our garage door opened plugged in to the outlet on the light socket. The opener already has its own lights which are brighter than the one in the socket so it gets used 99.95% of the time and has its own controls of course (wall control panel plus motion detection as well as door open/close activation). I can probably count on one hand how many time that pull chain socket has been used in the past 6 months.

With that said the wall switch is kinda redundant and also counter-intuitive as it also controls the outlet the opener is plugged into. Thankfully the opener does have a battery backup just in case.

What I have in mind that I'd like to do is remove that switch entirely and join the two portions of the circuit directly in that box and cover it up with a blanking plate. In addition I want to at least add a full duplex outlet on the joists by the opener instead of relying on the outlet in the light socket. Part of the reasoning for this is I have a plug-in vehicle I am utilizing a 110V/12A EVSE on that I'd also like to move over to this circuit. I might even go so far as to run another outlet on the opposite wall (where there is none now) which would be more convenient to plug the EVSE into. With the garage being unfinished, it makes it that much easier to run extra romex across.

Are there any major red flags or code concerns with this that anyone can think of? This is the only thing catching me up thinking and trying to plan this out. The only code related thing I have thought extensively about is adding a GFCI outlet to this. Seems the ceiling outlet I shouldn't require one but if I add one to an opposite wall I'd probably have to make that one GFCI which is fine. Actually doing the work wouldn't be all that difficult. I've already got the circuit breakers ID'd (what rooms/outlets/lights were attached to each circuit is very haphazard in this house sadly) and have already done some basic electrical already including replacing a GFCI and also some old outlets that were worn and backstabbed and got them done properly with the screw attach points. This wouldn't be all that much different.

ejkcwg|2020-01-03 19:30:26|Advice on clear water pump differences if any|"Think it's time to replace the flow pump i've on the roof, that takes in water from the roof clear water storage tank and sends it down the pipes with pressure so we get nice flow in the taps around the house.

Thing is, the shop always ask whether it's a ' flow ' pump from roof downwards, or a cistern pump that sucks from below ground and pushes water up high to storage tank. Are there real differences in such pumps?

Am aware that clear water pumps vary by pressure amounts measured in bars, which would explain how high the water can be pushed up. But from the way shops speak about either pumps it's as if they're constructed completely different and cannot be interchanged.

I've done my research on google but none meaningful hinting the differences in types-which helped me doubt the shops more. 

Maybe someone knowledgeable can bust this myth for me.

Cheers everyone

I've got a small maybe 3"" tall Mickey mouse figure that my 2 year old flushed in the toilet.

I'm not sure the best way to get it out.

Do I get a wet vac and try to suck it out?

Do I remove the toilet from the floor and try and remove it from the bottom side?

I'm not sure a snake would be a good idea in the event that it knocked it down further into the plumbing lines.

eji895|2020-01-03 17:03:10|Help me figure out where water is leaking in my wall?|"I have water leaking in the wall behind my kitchen sink, falling into the basement below. It's a fairly small amount of water--a drip every few seconds, but it adds up... 

Here's what I know: issues started a few weeks ago with a small amount of water leaking around the base of my kitchen faucet. It's a new faucet I put in about a year ago, so the gasket should be fine, and it hasn't leaked previously. I got underneath the sink and tightened the faucet connections but it didn't stop the leak. I hung a towel around the faucet to direct the leak down the sink and ignored it because I had family in town for the holidays.

A couple days later, I noticed a decent size puddle in the basement, below the sink area. But the cabinet under the sink was dry, so I assumed the leak was coming from somewhere else (the area under the sink in the basement is also where all the drains join to exit the house, so lots of possible sources). I started process-of-elimination running baths/showers and the dishwasher, and nothing seemed to cause the leak. 

Then the leak stopped, and the puddle in the basement dried up. So I ignored it again. But it came back a few days later, out of the blue, with no obvious cause. I tried to recreate it again, and the only thing I can figure out is that it seems to leak more if a bunch of water sources are working at once. 

But here's the weird part--if I turn the water supply off under the kitchen sink, the leak stops, even though that only affects the water supply to the sink. So, it definitely seems like the sink water supply is connected to the source of the basement leak, but all the hardware is visible under the sink, and the cabinet isn't wet. So where is the leak coming from? Is it possible that the leak around the faucet base is causing a loss of vacuum or something and allowing the water to leak behind the wall? I just can't understand why turning the water off under the sink (which only affects supply for the brief run from those valves to the faucet) would stop a leak in the wall? 

The only other possibility I can think of is that maybe there's a clog in the master drain or something and when a lot of water is being used it's backing up into a vent pipe and dripping out high in the wall or something? But if that was the case, I'd think it would be a larger flow when I am using lots of water.

Anyway, I'm confused about what's going on and I can't think of a simple physical problem that would explain it. I probably need a plumber, but I'd like to have a sense of what's going on before calling them. Thanks so much for sharing any ideas or knowledge."|PMmeserenity|False|https://redd.it/eji895|0|0.43|0|4|1|diy
ejhopa|2020-01-03 16:25:05|Two cement questions|"Two different projects that I'm working on that I need some advice for if anyone can help. I think it's better to ask in advice, rather than screw up and have forever lasting problems!

1. I am building a raised cement patio. Previously it was a wooden deck (no footers, no rock base...just a deck set on dirt).  The dirt base is now a very wet and spongy mud. I need to backfill (guessing) 15-20 inches of fill before the cement pad/sides of 4 inches.  How big of fill can I use before I work into CA6 for the cement base?  The patio will be 20x15...so a decent size.

2. I have a building that had a basement. I tore out all the flooring structure and started backfill the basement with part of a wall I cut out for a bay and man door. The building is approximately 40x60 and the fill varies in depth now...but ranges for 6 ft to 1 ft. The floor will eventually be poured concrete.  Does it matter of the size and type of fill prior to the CA6 base to prep for concrete?  How thick of CA6 should I do before the concrete? I was planning on a 6 inch concrete slab.

Tools of access: bobcat, dump truck, push behind plate compactor. For the building I could rent a plate compactor attachment for the bobcat if needed.

Please let me know any suggestions anyone may have.  Thank you!"|Racetimingco|False|https://redd.it/ejhopa|2|0.44|0|16|1|diy

DIY Dog House https://youtu.be/ssmfQXo2Aqc

Dog’s name: Rocket
Breed: German Shepherd

Foundation is 4 feet by 3 feet:
This seemed reasonable at first, but once constructed inside (my apartment), presented quite the problem.  It was pretty easy to break down and transporting the (already cut and partially screwed together walls/foundation) and materials was easy enough to fit in my Ford Fusion.  It still seemed huge, but this is for a very large dog, so we went with it.  
2 -2x4 cut to 48”
2 - 2x4 cut to 33” (to fit inside of the 48” pieces, will complete the outside of the frame)
2 - 2x4 cut to 33” for joist supports
6 - 5/8” x 6” x 8’ Cedar fence posts(cut to 48” for deck boards, {save what you cut off to be used later}
2 - handles of your choice
1 - 1 pound box of Deckmate 1 5/8” screws
**Will need (36) 2 1/2” screws for the frame, wall posts, and roof supports**

Build your frame as illustrated in the video (16 2 1/2” screws needed for this step).  The bottom of the frame is shown so you can see how the frame 2x4’s are secured together.  Joists were placed at 16” and 32” from one (48”) side for even spacing and support.  Cut your deck planks to 48” and use your 1 5/8” screws to secure the deck boards to the frame.  Don’t bury your screws in your boards or they will have a lot higher likelihood of splitting which is not awesome.  Cut your front and back deck boards to accommodate your 2x4 posts for your walls if desired or you can simply place your posts on top and secure them down with 2 2 1/2” screws for each wall post, in to the frame.  You are going to want to tape measure they spacing of your posts at the top, once you have them set.  You are screwing right in to the frame, so the tops of your wall posts should be very close to, if not right on, your 36” x 48” measurement from your foundation.  We aren’t building missiles here so it’s no biggie if you aren’t 100% square and plum, but for ease of construction and generally good practice, you should be.

Posts were cut to 32 1/2” in the front and 31 1/2” in the back to provide a gentle slope for water drainage as needed {and to make the front an even 36” tall (remember, I cut my front and back deck boards out for the post.  If you don’t do this, your measurement will be different to get a 36” tall front of your dog house).  Back wall boards should be cut to 49” (to allow a clean overlap so your corner looks nice and has minimal airflow).  Side boards shall be cut to 36” each, 5 per side plus one more each side to rip down to accommodate for the slope in the roof.  You will see in the video that the tops of the side board (that I ripped down to accommodate for the slope) didn’t match up with the front and the back boards.  This was later corrected on both sides.  2 cedar planks cut to 49” for boards across the top of the front, 4 cedar planks cut to 28” for the left of the door, and 4 cedar planks cut to 4” for the right of the door.  Door opening will measure about 16” wide and 20 1/2” tall.  Screw 4 2x4 scraps inside to act as bracing for the roof supports.  Roof supports are 2x4’s, cut to 36”.  Secure the supports to the braces with 2 1/2” screws, 8 needed for this step.  I cut the roof panels to 51” to allow for a one inch overlap on the sides, once the side panels are installed.  As you can tell, we saved some money but using the tops of the pickets (which would have been waste) for roof pieces, and to give it a nice looking front & top edge.  Line all of your panels up and screw them in place.  This dog house is under a covered patio so we aren’t especially worried about water leakage at this point.  Necessary modifications can be made as the time comes.  Please feel free to leave a comment or suggestion.  Thanks for your time.

It's two levels of board horizontally, supported on both sides by another 6mm (1/4 inch) identical pine board cut in half and placed vertically so it's about 0.75 feet high. 

I've supported it with 4 L shaped steel corner brackets (about 1.5 inch long on each side of the L) on each level and four screws into each bracket.

I'm curious if this is strong enough to support the weight of a laptop (about 3-4 pounds) on each plank. I'm worried it might collapse. 

I've googled but I can't seem to find any weight limits for this kind of bracket. Anything bigger than this sort of bracket seems to be about half a foot long at least, which is far too long to fit between the shelves. Any advice as to whether it'll stay up or if I need new brackets?

Apologies if I'm in the wrong subreddit, but I've been scratching my head about this one for a while and can't seem to find answers online. The back of my old thermostat has no clear labelling that matches guides I've seen online...

I moved into an apartment a few months ago with a bizarro HVAC system. It supports heating and cooling, but not at the same time, and there's a wall switch to toggle between them. The thermostat itself seems ancient (Tekmar 2516) and has no numbers on it. There are two sensor panels elsewhere on the ceiling.

The unit itself is located in a drop ceiling which is a bit hard to access, hence the shitty pictures. I'm hoping I can at least replace the old thermostat with something a bit 'smarter'. If that's not possible, I'd at least like to understand why not!

Any ideas would be amazing! Ideally I can connect a nest or something in place of that old monstrosity. Thanks!

The tech came with the replacement part and needed to put in a bushing as the new one was 1/4 thread and the old was 3/8”. The only one available around here was black steel type. 

I believe the pipe it goes into is either brass or copper, and the sensor threads looked like brass. 

I asked about rust being a concern and he said it wouldn’t be a problem. But should I be concerned?  It’s a closed system so minimal oxygen will be introduced. And it’s a very small part that is exposed to the water inside. 

It’s a real pain to get to, but I could probably replace it myself with a brass one if needed. But would rather not if it isn’t really necessary (for the longevity of the system and the sensor).

\--chimney is framed on the outside of the building, so fireplace is essentially flush to wall

\--plan is for some form of tongue and groove 1 x 6, shiplap, etc, from base to ceiling

\--would like to eventually attach a faux mantel as well. 

\--my thought is to build a bit of a frame by nailing lumber on the flat to the drywall, trimming all of the edges of that, and laying the tongue and groove/shiplap on top of the frame, inside the trim

\--we have no interest in making this fireplace functional--decorative only

&#x200B;

Questions:

\--the plan is to run straight up from the edges of the faux brick/slab base, all the way to the ceiling. How do I secure the edges of my frame to the wall if there are no studs behind that to nail to? I'm assuming I can nail the top of it into the top plate.

The mechanism is built into the brick surrounding the fireplace so we’ve tried to remove the fireplace insert to access the mechanism from the side.

The gas lines are all underneath the slab of the house and, from the origin point, hits the hot water heater and then the fireplace and then the furnace. That being said, there is no way to cut off gas to just the fireplace as the pipe junction is underneath the slab and the only point of access cuts off gas to the entire house.

Hello fellow DIY'ers

Heres my issue, first off, the help I need is in regards to plumbing codes in US/CANADA, I appreciate the UK help, but from what I understand we plumb things differently here than over there.

Kitchen sink got clogged, Ive snaked it before but It was all plumbed up wrong. Side by side kitchen sink with garbuerator on the left, also plumbed in dishwasher. Heres the clincher... No P trap. or at least appeared like there was no P trap. I have an endoscopic camera and ran it down the pipe, guess what I found under the cabinet...and under the floor... yes the P trap. But not only is it almost completley unaccessible, its GLUED FITTINGS!!! 

So im going to get into the crawl space, Cut off the existing P trap, run straight line going up into the cabinet, and properly plumb up a P trap and plumb up the two sink sides properly!

&#x200B;

Heres where I need help. The main line out to the sewer in lower than the sink, obvioustly, but much lower. In order to run the pipe, It would come out of the ground, go up into the cabinet, then 90 degree over to where my new P trap will be. This will result in a S trap.

Your help is needed and would be greatly appreciated!

I have a teeny tiny bathroom, with an inward open door that makes no sense. It's time for that door to go. 

Ideally, would love to replace it with a sliding door that runs along the hallway wall. 

Couple of things in the way... the outer trim of the doorframe sticks out about 12mm- and as you can see, there's a big 'box' on the roof (that hides a steel support beam). 

All my googling suggests most sliding doors need a bit of room above the door itself- and no trim on the doorframe.

I'm wondering:

1. What am I looking at? I'm still very new to all this, so I'm not sure what all the components are called. I think the part of the wall that has chipped away is stucco on galvanized lath -- is that right?
2. What are the likely cause(s) of the failure? I see that the metal stuff that appears to be supporting the stucco seems to be missing where the stucco has fallen away. I'm guessing that the metal support was cut away in order to install the electric light, and that it was patched over with something that isn't durable. Or maybe there's pervasive water damage behind the wall that I can't see, and this is just the first part of the wall to fail?
3. What's the right way to fix the problem? Should it be patched over with something? Should some galvanized lath be patched into the hole first? Should there be some kind of barrier between the stucco and the electrical wires? Or does a large section of the wall need to be replaced?
4. If I decide to hire an expert instead of doing it myself (since I'm still pretty clueless), who can I call to fix the problem? Do I call a mason? An electrician? A structural engineer? A handyman? A roofer (if it's caused by water leaking through the roof)?

Anybody have direct experience with any of these patching compounds.|"I am patching plaster walls in a bathroom, composed of gypsum board lath with a scratch coat and finish coat of plaster. The patching areas are down into the scratch coat. I have been using plaster on  the wall patches, but I've used up what I had and I want to use a compound that is  easier to sand for  the  remainder which includes overhead work on the ceiling. If is a bathroom so I want something  water proof-ish as regular drywall compound deteriorates in the moisture. So I want to use either a water resistant/water proof drying-type compound, or I want  to use a setting-type compound so it will not soften in the presence of moisture. I've found these three, and not sure about them, looking for experienced users.

The FastPatch30 comes in powdered form, but its not clear to me that this is Setting-type  compound, and not Drying-type compound in dry form. ( confirmed this is a setting compound, but fast setup, short workability means small batches)

The Platinum Patch is a Drying-type compound  but says it is an exterior filler.

The Ready Patch is also a  Drying-type compound, but says it is interior&exterior.

I don't really have the money right now for an engineer.  


Heating was working fine until a few days ago, i still get hot water but the radiators barely heat up and i turned the thermostat to max at this point to see if it makes any difference. Does not.

Some radiators are warmer at the top and not so on bottom, and others are bottom warm and cold top. The only one that is getting more heat is the closest one to the boiler, in my bathroom.  
This is why im confused, because reading online if its cold top, they said to flush, but then i have both, some with cold bottom some with cold top. Tried flushing anyway, but no air came out just water so i closed it as soon as i opened it.  
THen i checked the boiler and noticed the pressure was 0, i put that back to 1.4 but it did nothing.  


Gotta mention this part, most important: Arround the time this happened, one of my house-mates was cleaning the house as it is for hollidays and he has a few things in the boiler room despite he should not have, he was throwing some of it out.

I’ve tried using a few online calculators but the differences between them are huge that it’s very hard to try and get a accurate reading

Tank 2:

30mm dowel

69\*69mm posts

92\*9mm tongue and groove boards

I had never done any woodgluing before, so this was a bit of a learning curve. Luckily I've lurked on r/DIY for long enough to have picked up some valuable advice along the way.

Still to do:
Add plugs to cover the screw holes in the top plate

We just bought a new house. It was just built in 2017 by a very reputable builder. It even has a 10 year structural warranty. But the bathtub was never caulked which seems crazy to me! I assumed a bathtub always needs to be caulked at the seams so that water doesn't get into the walls. But I'm far from an expert and I hate to doubt such a reputable builder. After much googling, it seems possible that the tub is [this kind which snaps together and supposedly doesn't need caulk.](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Sterling-Ensemble-32-in-W-x-60-in-L-White-Vikrell-Rectangular-Right-Hand-Drain/1018359) Even if it is this brand, there's still issues with mildew - seen in these pics http://imgur.com/gallery/u0xuEHc.

Ok so on to my question! Even if this bathtub doesn't technically *need* to be caulked, would it (or the wall behind it) be damaged if I did choose to caulk it? I've seen some DIY advice that explains that you shouldn't caulk at the seam where there's tile/grout, so I want to make sure this isn't a similar situation and I'm just too inexperienced to know better.

My brother is planning on installing a smart thermostat in his home, and tasked me with helping him (remotely) figure out the wiring.

First things first -- here is the old wiring:
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/654509307400028189/660299052591874075/IMG_0195.jpg

The red wire is thankfully unused and not connected on either side.

Here is what it looks like on the furnace side. It's a bit of a mess:
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/654509307400028189/660322104214028298/IMG_0199.jpg

The two brown wires are coming off the 24V side of the transformer. The brown wire that starts on the left and goes into the orange wire nut in the bottom right goes up to the thermostat as W, and the other brown wire goes into the clear wire nut.

I'm pretty confident that setting up the C wire is as simple as running the spare wire down to the clear wire nut (obviously a new nut). Am I correct? Just want to make sure I'm not gonna burn a house down :)"|-Quantumcross|False|https://redd.it/ei9oci|3|0.81|0|13|1|diy

Does this mean the closet would need to have a step down into it, or can I build up on top of the joists to match where the floor currently sits (preferred)?

I've attached a picture of the empty attic space, looking at the wall that would receive the door. You can see how the joists I'm standing on are mounted towards the bottom of the beam, whereas the floor to the room is sitting on top of it.  I hope I'm making sense..

I recently installed a bunch of Lutron Caseta dimmer switches that have turned out to be incompatible with my recessed lights. I’d like to replace the bulbs/fixtures/whatever, if feasible.


I’m familiar with normal retrofit recessed lights, which simply pull out and you can screw in a trim kit/light combo that clips in. I have those in my basement drop ceilings and they’re really easy to do.


Unfortunately, on the first floor of my multi-level home (no attic access above these), the recessed lights seem to be a bit different, as pictured below in my imgr link. When I try to pull them out, they feel quite heavy and stick after an inch or so. They feel like they’re attached to some sort of metal lever coming off the side, but I can’t be sure.


I can’t even find what these are when searching through Lowe’s or Home Depot. I can’t imagine you need to rip the ceiling out to deal with these? What if one breaks? I actually have one that doesn’t work and needs to be replaced anyway.


So, in short, can these be replaced? Can I replace a bulb? What on earth is this?

In the bathrooms the company installed vinyl plank flooring over the top of the previous two laminate layers of flooring. My dad and grandpa helped me re-install the toilets after the flooring was installed. Fast forward 2 months and I'm crawling around under the house only to notice a small leak around the hall toilet. Somehow the toilet in the hall never got tightened down (the bolts were finger tight) when we were re-installing it, so the wax ring never created a seal (the wax ring did not deform at all). It must have been a small leak since I never saw it on the floor, but it was leaking around the flange into the subfloor. On 12/22 I took out the flooring and cut the underlayment to expose all of the wet subfloor which had some standing water on it. I wiped up as much water as I could, cranked the heat up to 70*, and rented a carpet fan for 2 days. I let the fan run as much as possible before taking it back 2 days later.

I went out of town on 12/24 for roughly a week and got back home last night.

I am working on designing a mini treadmill for a research project where our rats will run on a miniature treadmill for an exercise study. There are several versions of homemade treadmills that I have seen but none quite match the available supplies we have. We have a non motorized, under-the-desk style treadmill that we would like to take advantage of, but that means we must attach our own motor to the treadmill. 

We have an 18 volt motor harvested from a cordless drill that we think should work for the treadmill, but I need help with the wiring. We know that the motor is DC and that power from the wall is AC. The treadmill has a built in speedometer that should allow us to monitor the speed of the moving belt once powered by the motor. Ideally we would have the motor attached to the roller of the treadmill, an on/off switch, and a dial similar to a dimmer switch that would allow us to regulate the speed of the motor. 

It feels like it should be a fairly simple wiring set up but we wanted to throw the idea out there to you guys to hopefully save time on any unforeseen obstacles and frustrations. Thanks!"|michelle102091|False|https://redd.it/ehsy1s|22|0.75|0|12|1|diy

Goal:

* Most cost-effectively heat my home.

House:

* One-story with finished basement
* Currently heated with Oil furnace (pretty expensive). Fireplace only in basement.

Notes:

* I'll be doing the work myself as much as possible.
* Labor involved isn't the highest concern. I like to work.
* I hear that Hydronic is the most efficient but since the basement slab is already poured, I'm likely limited to electric radiant flooring down there (without reducing the height of the basement significantly) leaving me the option of hydronic upstairs only. Is it silly to mix the two?

Also, is it wise to use a combination of floor heating + forced air + baseboard + IR (likely not all but... some combination)?

\*\*Edit\*\*   
Im planning on using a 3-7k watt inverter Generator... air cooled, and I will be using fans in the box to rapidly cycle air at about 5-15 the volume of the box per minute)  
/Edit

I formerly did a fair bit of research on and DIY'd some related things, speaker boxes and airflow/cooling ( Im a audio nut and professionally an IT person)

Im thinking trapezoid like box squared off on one side (actually not quite square) with a slopping roof (its going outside in my yard.)Half inch MDF sides with a plywood base (raised a few inches) and a 2x4 frame.

Lining each panel will be Mass loaded Vinyl stapled or glued to the MDF.  Possibly either the ""egg crate"" type foam or  aluminum Sound Deadening Mat for car audio on top? (I dont want to go too overboard, but might add the second layer on top of the MLV later down the road.)

Ill need to have a vent on the top off to one side, small baffles on the above and to the side for weather protection and to keep the noise in the box. Or maybe Use a static roof vent (I suspect this will be less effective at holding noise in. (But I could use the same MLV/sound mat) (Maybe make my own with an old pot, the thickness would surely be better for sound)Downward  facing open air vents on the bottom of the far side, I could use 3-4"" PCV pipes/elbows for intake protruding from the side, or perhaps just open vents in the bottom.... Maybe low profile roof vents here too? (it would baffle the noise further)I could glue a couple of fans inside to help control hot spots  (if they are bad?) Maybe some PVC to ""catch"" the mufflers exhaust and direct it towards the roofs fan?

What are you Expert DIY ideas? Im obviously still ""spit balling ideas"" but think this would work.... and well (although Im probably guilty of going overboard)

Questions:

1. Does 1"" thick PVC seem like it would be sturdy enough? The weight at the top shouldn't be significant, but once you start getting that height on it, it adds up.

2. What is a good way to attach the steel wire to the base? It needs to be adjustable at the bottom, to adjust for the various heights. I was thinking maybe just a quick grip clamp (like these -> https://smile.amazon.com/IRWINQUICK-GRIPOne-Handed-Mini-Clamp-Pack-1964743/dp/B00004YOBR) but that seems really inelegant.

3. What is a good way to attach the steel wire to the top, for permanent use? I'm not clear on if I can get steel wire with a loop on one end. I only need a max of 13' of it or so (over-assuming 12' height and 1.5' base)

4. Couplings vs Unions. Unions would screw together, couplings just stick together. Not sure what benefits I would see. The couplings seem quicker to teardown than having to unscrew the whole thing.

1) Does it really matter? Some articles say the hot wire term is used interchangeably with load wire and line wire.

New homeowner, not much of a ""DIYer"" but I've been giving it a shot...

The project took me about 8 hours, spread along several week-ends, but now, if I would have to do it again, I think I can make it in half of that time.

&#x200B;

List of materials:

\- 2 pine boards (20 mm x 60 mm x 2000 mm), for the bottom part of the box

\- 2 pine boards (20 mm x 120 mm x 2000 mm), for the frame of the box

\- 18 5x30 wood screws, for the bottom pieces

\- 12 45x35 wood screws, for the frame

\- a big cardboard box, sorry, I can't be more precise than that :)

&#x200B;

List of tools I used:

\- hand clamp

\- ruler

\- tape rule

\- cutting knife

\- electric pendulum saw

\- electric manual router

\- electric planer

\- cordless electric screwdriver

\- electric sander

\- 10 mm x 20 mm router bit

The dimensions of the box (interior): 400 mm x 580 mm

Bottom pieces length: 420 mm

The groove to accommodate the bottom pieces was made at 10 mm from the bottom part of the frame, on the long edges of the frame, it was 10 mm deep and was made with the router bit listed above (10 mm diameter)

The ""fins"" for the bottom part were made with the same router bit, 5 mm deep and having the width of 10 mm.

ehf49i|2019-12-30 01:40:52|Kenmore Dryer (11086880100 ) Repair Help|"My kenmore dryer (model 11086880100) stopped heating. My hours of research lead me to believe that I should test the thermal fuse, heating element, hi limit thermostat and thermal cut off. Ended up buying [this kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TN3P4XK/?fbclid=IwAR1FklOC_AoqVrJiXgbAF1UsDfORABhMbbdqrE2RBy9QMOSxnAj3YyFTC7o#customerReviews) on Amazon since I don't own a multimeter. It came with most of the parts that I need. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/J0ISIk2) is a picture of the back of my dryer with a few notes I made. It looks like there are 2 hi low thermostats installed on the heating element case.  I thought the heating element is supposed to have 1 hi low thermostat (on the bottom) and a thermal cut off switch (on the top)? What am I missing here? Part of the confusion is the variance of that component names. 

Obviously, this dryer is very old and I bought it second-hand. I was VERY surprised to see that the thermal fuse was bypassed. I'm not 100% sure if the blue and black wires are normally used to connect to the fuse or not. Every picture I have seen illustrates 2 blue wires, which sounds close enough. But why leave it like that since it presents a potential liability? Thankfully, nothing has happened in the 8 years I've owned the dryer. 

Do I really need to solder on new clamps to the wires or can I crimp the 2 extra red wires came with the orange caps I have left over from the Amazon kit I haven't used? Are they even the correct wires that should be connected to the thermal fuse? You know what they say about assumptions. 

So far, I replaced the heating element and replaced L290-40f (top position) with L290-80f. Turned on the dryer for 30 seconds and it produced VERY hot air, so mission accomplished. I assume the heating element was bad and I may not have had to replace the hi low thermostat.

But shouldn't that be where the thermal cut off is connected instead? 

Why are there 2 hi low thermostats? What purpose does that serve? Obviously the dryer has been working forever, but I'm concerned about safety now that I know how it was connected inside. I'd prefer not to burn down my new house lol.

The way I understand things is the cycling thermostat monitors the temperature, via the heating element. If it gets too hot then the thermal fuse shuts off the dryer to prevent a fire. My heating element (see picture above) is controlled by a wire that comes from the cycling thermostat and another one from somewhere else. There's a jumper from the heating element prong (way at the bottom) to the hi low thermostat.  That thermostat helps to protect the dryer from overheating from the airflow and if it's too hot the thermal cuts off power to reduce the risk of fire.  

I don't even know if the wires are connected the correct way. Does it really matter since the dryer is now heating? Why did they have to be all red lol. 

I'd really appreciate some help."|escondido22|False|https://redd.it/ehf49i|2|0.67|0|3|1|diy

The outlet is controlled by a switch. I have tested the switch with a voltage tester. When the switch is off, I get a positive result by the hot wire and nothing by the other wire. When the switch is on, I get a positive result at both wires. So the switch seems to work and electricity does flow. [Here is a picture of the wires and screws of the switch itself.](https://imgur.com/a/NGwakzJ) The brass screw is the one that the hot wire is attached to. I did notice that this light switch seems to have two wires the same color and you can see that there are white wires, but they have been covered up with electrical tape. That is the state things were in when I opened it. Additionally, that switch is new and one that I replaced the old one with. 

When the switch is in the on position, the outlet seems to get power, however I only get a positive result from the voltage tester at one wire but not at the other. When I plug a lamp into it, I also get a positive result from the voltage tester at the plug. However the lamp won't turn on. It is not the outlet as I have replaced it. [Here is a video of me voltage testing around the new outlet.](https://imgur.com/9Ls0fy4) 

There are only two wires in the outlet. The black wire is attached to a brass screw on the right side (where the voltage tester gives a positive result) and the white wire is attached to a silver screw on the left side. 

There have been no sparks and no heat coming off the outlet and the lamp still works in other outlets. 

So any idea what could be going on here? Thank you in advance."|TomHardyAsBronson|False|https://redd.it/ehbdtp|0|0.44|0|4|1|diy

\*Get a couple water spigots in the back yard

\*Run gas line for a fire pit (my house uses natural gas)

\*Run electricity to a shed

\*Run electricity to outdoor string lights that would be hardwired to a light switch (not just plugged into an outlet)

\*(Possibly run electric to an outside bar that abuts the back of the house)

Cliff Notes:  
Step 1- Buy a car  
Step 2- Strip car down so that all that is left are the welds holding the chassis together  
Step 3- Strategically decide where you can make cuts that allow the car to be bolted back together and be hidden by body trim pieces  
Step 4- Use a Sawsall and metal demon cutting blade to slice the car into small enough pieces that you can get them through doorways and around corners.  
Step 5- Pressure was the car parts BEFORE moving them inside  
Step 6- Reassemble car using metal bracing and self-taping sheet metal screws  
Step 7- Install Simulator components (Steering wheel, Pedals, etc)  
Step 8- Install Monitor  
Step 9- Install Computer  
Step 10- Install software   
Step 11- Have fun!  


I have always wanted to build a sim rig. I don't care about being a pro racer. I don't think I will be scouted by an F1 team, I just wanted to build a rig to have some fun. I looked at a few rig frames, seats, etc and thought it was crazy how expensive some could be. After looking through the options, I decided I wanted to try and do something different, I thought it would be fun to build a sim rig using a real car. I wanted to take it a step further than a sim in the garage though, I wanted to deconstruct a car and reconstruct it in my basement. I have built a lot of cars for street and track, and I know very well how easy it is for a car project to turn into a pile of parts, so I had to carefully plan out the process before I got in too deep.

The first thing I needed was a budget. I set the dollar amount to $1000 thinking I could find a decent shell or front end damaged car that I could cut up and build. I looked and looked, but didn't see anything that was interesting enough to spend the time on regardless of the price, so I decided to up the budget to $2,000 in hopes of finding something really cool. I wanted a convertible because it would be a lot easier to cut up and reassemble with hopes of the panels lining back up after being cut. It only took me a week at the $2000 budget to find a really clean e36 M3 vert with a full interior and was complete, other than the engine and trans. This was perfect for me because I was going to have to remove the drivetrain for the project regardless. I called the guy, got him down to $1800 delivered to me (local delivery), and was excited to had found such a cool car for the project. I called the guy later to arrange delivery only to find out he had sold the car out from under me.

I kept looking for a while and eventually found a 2005 Mini Cooper S advertised as running, but with some issues for $2000. I called and asked about the issues and he said the timing was off. I told him that likely meant it had bent valves and I would give him $1,000 for the car delivered to my house. He said ok, and the rest is history.

As soon as the car came, it was time to get to work. I started by posting the drivetrain on craigslist to try and recoup some of the $1,000 I had spent on the entire car. Within a day or two I was able to sell all of the parts I didn't want for roughly what I paid for the car. So at that point, I had the car for Free. While the drivetrain was picked apart, I started to strip the car down to the chassis. I removed EVERYTHING that I would not use and either trashed or sold the parts. When I was done, there was a nice blue and white chassis in my garage. I even pulled the windshield and glass.

It took me some time to decide how I wanted to cut the car up to get it through my doorways and down the stairs to the basement. With a convertible, the cuts are a bit easier to make and hide, but with the hardtop mini, I had to be careful with how and where to cut. I was going to use a circular saw to do the work, but then I found an awesome video on Youtube where these guys were cutting trailer hitch balls using a sawzall. The blade they used cut through the ball pretty well and it looked like it didn't lose too much metal, so I decided to buy a DeWalt flexvolt sawzall with a metal demon blade. I was able to completely cut the car down using 2 blades. If I hadn't jackknifed the blade, I probably could have done it all with just one blade too. I was really impressed.

After I cut the car down, I moved it in pieces to the basement. From there, I used metal mending plates and a mixture of bolts and sheet metal screws to put the car back together. To my absolute amazement, it lined up very well and all of the original bolts lined right up. Even the seat mounts lined right up. The hardest part of it all was getting the roof back on. I knew it would be hard, and it was the only thing that required a lot of force to line back up and bolt back on.  


Once the car was reassembled, It was time to do the fun stuff, installing the electronics.  I started with mounting the steering wheel/ wheel base.  I had a friend weld me a collar and tap holes into it so that I could bolt it to the original dash support bar where the old steering column mounted.  The main issue with this is that there is no telescoping or adjustment, so the wheel sits maybe half an inch too low, but one day I will make adjustments to the seat so I can lower myself that way rather than re welding the dash.    


After installing the wheel and Pedals, I worked on fitting the monitor to the car.  Originally I cut the dash so the monitor support could go through it, but later I removed the support and tucked the monitor inbetween the a pillars and used industrial velcro to hold the monitor in place.  I also used a heavy black material similar to carpet to make a hood for the monitor to block out the outside light.    


Once that was all in, I put the computer in the engine bay on some tiles, wired everything up and installed the software for iracing, dirt rally 2.0, assetto corsa, forza horizon 4 (for the neighbor kids), and project cars 2.    


Since completing the car, I have also installed two logitech streamer cams as well as the Buttkicker Bass Shaker in the driver seat.   


Although the car is ""Done"" now, I am sure it will continue to evolve as I come up with new ideas on how to improve it, but this post should give you the gist of the project.

[Area of damage](https://postimg.cc/PC6wT1Wb) 




TL;DR - Cracked laptop hinge, can’t disassemble laptop to fix it, and can’t buy a replacement hinge, need a physical way to keep it held down.I’ve tried using epoxy with no results. If anyone could help me out, thank you!


I have a cracked laptop hinge and I can’t disassemble the laptop so I have to figure out how to physically repair it without buying a replacement hinge, which I can’t find anywhere on the market. The disconnected hinge doesn’t move and therefore makes contact with the bottom panel of my laptop and pushes it out when the lid is opened/closed. It also makes the screen very flimsy and not secure at all. 




The images are after I’ve already lined it up where it cracks after a long time with pliers. But essentially if I were to open the lid right now, the hinge would stick right out. 


I’ve got a quote from a computer repair store and since it’s a rarer laptop (Gigabyte Aero 15) the repair cost is very high, so I decided not to go for it. But is there a DIY way to fix this? I was thinking of getting a right angle bracket and then using epoxy to secure the hinge but I’m not sure if it will work.


I’ve tried just using epoxy and that did not work out. If anyone could help that would be great.



Thank you!"|kshawoo|False|https://redd.it/eh1kzl|4|0.82|0|10|1|diy

eh043y|2019-12-29 02:23:03|Visiting non-DIYer family|"We are staying with some extremely non-DIY family members over the holidays. As a self-professed DIY enthusiast, and as someone who is seldom shy of a DIY challenge, it’s SO hard to be staying in a house that’s so contrary to how I operate.

Examples:
1.	Master bathroom hot faucet has not been turned on in over 4 years because it drips. So rather than simply solving this, they just turn off the supply line and use the sink in the main bathroom. The husband has to go in the main bathroom to shave every morning and doesn’t seem the slightest bit inconvenienced by this.
2.	The dimmer switch in the kids bedroom stopped working so they simply have no light in there. They use flashlights when needed.
3.	There are innumerable loose (or completely hanging by a thread) doorknobs around the house.
4.	Numerous burnt out lightbulbs in key areas that are just left unattended for years.

When I first started coming here to visit, I was astounded that none of this seemed to bother them. I took it upon myself to fix as much as I could one day when they were out at work. I was shocked that not only did they not seem to appreciate it, they actually seemed bothered that I had done that. 

In hindsight, I’ve come to realize how my actions were interpreted as potential critique but it still shocks me that none of this phases them. It’s not that they can’t afford to hire anybody to deal with this, they are both well-paid professionals. 

What annoys me the most is that the neglect is contributing to the premature demise and destruction of their home.

They have a bathroom they have never bothered to get a bath mat for. As a result, they have a huge amount of water damage around the tub where their kids dry off.

Have you ever met people like this? I guess everyone has different priorities but every time I come here to visit, I can only handle a couple days and I want to run out screaming."|pinkcanoe|False|https://redd.it/eh043y|8|0.6|0|32|1|diy

egrszv|2019-12-28 15:12:43|How do roof leaks get detected with closed cell foam in the rafters?|"I'd like to insulate my attic as the first step in a series of major DIY improvements to my house. I'd need the attic to be insulate to run water lines to put the water heater in the attic, then I could also move the air handler up there and then the trunk space that currently contains the exhaust vents can be reframed to closet space.

I think I would prefer closed cell foam for the air barrier qualities, but my concern is that any roof leak will cause pooling above the insulation and then that would lead to extensive rot until discovered.

I've tried looking around online for answers, but all I seem to see is insulation contractors saying something along the lines of, ""make sure the roof doesn't leak, hurrr,"" which is not helpful at all because all roofs will leak eventually.

I was wondering if it's possible to install the corrugated baffles from the eaves to the ridge vent and then spray over that. These would be the same baffles that they use to ensure air circulation with traditional attic insulation, to keep the batts off the sheathing by the eaves.

I had even thought I could sprinkle some chalk line dust in the baffles before installation, and then I'd see color coming out of one of the eaves if it's leaking, but I don't know if this is overkill or if there's some other standard way of handling the **eventuality** that a roof *will* leak. 

I'm okay if the roof leaks - I'll replace it. I just don't want to replace the rafters and sheathing along with the roof when I do it (and whatever is under the roof when it collapses from rot). 

So, tl;dr: What's the standard way to handle spray foam under a roof deck? Only open-cell or is there some clever technique to use with closed-cell?"|shtpst|False|https://redd.it/egrszv|27|0.8|0|27|1|diy

Photo of DIY repair: https://imgur.com/a/H5sLSXL

WE SOLVED IT! After a bit of experimenting and trial and error, we finally found a solution to this problem that was DIY and cost $136! 

First things first, i had the city come out and look at the driveway & gutter. They told me they could build a ramp for me but they weren’t sure if that would solve the problem. Plus it would be a while before they could get out there. After a few minutes of chatting, they gave me their blessing to do whatever we wanted as driveway maintenance and they have me their names in case code enforcement ever asked. They let me know they highly doubted code enforcement would be a problem though. 

So, last weekend my FIL and husband played with putting some pavers down in the gutter. And it bumped up the cars enough for very mild scraping. 

With that, they decided a ramp was worth a try. For materials they used 8 bags Blacktop Repair Asphalt from Home Depot & 8 feet of 10 inch PVC pipe cut in half (half moon shape) to build a ramp with a flowing pipe for drainage. They used a tamper, a rake, and a shovel to create the ramp.  They laid down the half moon PVC pipe and poured the mixture on top. They smoothed and tampered down with the tools above. This created an 8 foot ramp with drainage.

It took them about an hour and a half, and it ended up not working. The lip of the hump from the old asphalt still grabbed onto the underside of the cars. 

When I got home from work, we went back out there to brainstorm some more. We decided to take some of the suggestions to break up the layer of asphalt, and using a breaker bar & a shovel we peeled up the asphalt with ease. It maybe took an hour from start to cleanup. We then tampered down the ramp
Some more, and TADA! 

That’s all it needed, a ramp & lowering the asphalt and now both cars clear the driveway and we parked in the garage for the first time since we bought the house over two weeks ago.

Now, it’s pretty ugly looking, so we’re going to save us to reseal the driveway for a more cohesive look, but it was cheap and works! As an added bonus, it rained later and we saw no worse drainage into our driveway since there is still a hump just not as drastic.

We plan on pressure washing the driveway to give it a facelift, and remove the asphalt stains where we broke up the old mess. 

Thank you everyone for all your suggestions!"|Lavenderfaux|False|https://redd.it/eh0qjw|3|0.8|0|1|1|diy
egx3f3|2019-12-28 22:11:37|My Copper Water Pipes and Toilets are Sweating -- So Far I Haven't Had Success|"Hi, everyone,

The copper water pipes in my basement coming into my house and then going throughout the house are sweating. These are the only pipes that are exposed and that I can see. I can only hope that others are not sweating in the drywall. I noticed this about three weeks ago. I installed some foam insulation on the pipes. This has helped the dripping of water from the pipes onto the floor, but when I pry open the foam, they are still sweating. 

&#x200B;

Today, I noticed that two toilets upstairs also now have condensation on the tanks. 

&#x200B;

A few details about my situation: My house was built in the mid 1990s. I live in St. Louis Metro (USA) and its been mostly seasonal temperatures and the last few days its been unseasonably warm (highs in the 60s). I have lived in this house about 9 years and have never had this issue before. 

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do at this point, but I am becoming very concerned. Most of my research mentions the humidity from summer days, but it is certainly not summer where I live now and when I noticed the pipes sweating the first time it was temps in the 20s-40s. I keep my house around 68 degrees with the furnace on and 75 with the AC on. The AC has not been on during any of this. 

&#x200B;

Thank you for any help. I have attached two photos. One is a sweating pipe, the other is where the water line enters my house.

First ever post on Reddit so hopefully I'm compliant with forum rules and following proper etiquette. I'm in the process of re-finishing a room in my basement and starting to worry that the existing framing / insulation may need to be replaced based on what I've been reading. The house was built in 1960 and is located in Nova Scotia, Canada. In the room I'm renovating, two of the walls are on the exterior walls of the foundation, which is poured concrete. The current framing is 3/4"" deep with 1/4"" furring strip over top and had previously been finished with wood wall panels. The framing sits directly against the concrete foundation with 1"" foam panels for insulation between the studs. The insulation runs down to the base of the framing, which is at the same height as the subfloor. I'm concerned over the fact that there's no vapour barrier and the studs sitting directly against the concrete will create a thermal bridge. Wondering if before drywalling I should do one of the following or something completely different:

1. tape the seams between the framing and foam insulation and let that serve as the vapour barrier
2. install a vapour barrier over the existing framing and insulation
3. completely replace the framing and insulation with a proper setup (hoping to avoid this due to costs)
4. just drywall over what's there now

If it matters, we have had water come into the basement twice over the past 3+ years during heavy rain in the winter but  once mopped up, was only a few cups of water. I run a dehumidifier down there and haven't seen any signs of mold. Any advice would be welcomed!

The bathroom is very short and only has 70"" from the edge of the shower pan to ceiling so we had to go with a smaller enclosure BUT now our problem is that the enclosure is a little too small for our shower pan from side to side.

Sorry for the bad photos, but I believe it shows that we have a slight damp problem in patches. The tiles are uneven, and the whole room has a wave effect going on. I lifted up a couple of the tiles that were wobbly and noticed the cement base underneath has been cracked.  


Ideally, I'd like not to take up the whole floor, and just repair the damaged areas.  
However, I'm on a tight deadline, and I don't want to waste time attempting to repair the floor, only to have the carpet layers come in and tell me they can't lay it on top of this floor.

I have really awkward windows where I need to add some curtains. It is essentially two big windows, with one little one joined on the side as a right angle. The big windows are 230cm in width, and the side window is 39cm.

I have thought about possibly adding curtains using a metal pole and an angle joint to curve around the small window. 

The problem is the windows go all the way to the ceiling so the pole would need to be mounted there. Years ago when I moved in I went to add a pole this way before, drilled in and there only seemed to be a few cm of plaster and then a hollow gap. I am not sure if putting plugs into just a small amount of plaster would be strong enough to hold the curtains?

egnojx|2019-12-28 07:04:16|Cutting Board (Maple, Mahogany, Macadamia?) With Coffee and Coconut Oil Stain|"Materials Required

\- Router (and a relatively wide bit)

\- Table saw (can sub for a circular saw but will take a lot longer)

\- Miter saw or hand saw

\- Coffee

\- Coconut oil

\- Orbital Sander and Sandpaper

&#x200B;

I pieced together this alternative to salad bowl stain from various online sources. I wish I could reference them but I can't find them anymore; in any case some recipes call for adding vinegar to the coffee mix, I've never tried it so I can't speak to whether it's helpful in any way.

I used original mahogany, some leftover maple of a lighter shade from another project, a dark maple, and I \_think\_ some sort of macadamia. Picked them up from a local hard woods dealer so they were of varying widths and thicknesses. The closest sort of average I could find amongst board thickness I had was 3/4"", so for the thicker boards I just cut them to 3/4"" width and was limited to the thickness of the piece (somewhere between 1 3/4"" and 2.5"" so not a big deal).

So the first step was to cut a bunch of stuff to 3/4"" thickness and of whatever width you want-- really just a bunch of different sizes-- or if you want a really patterned and consistent aesthetic then you know... cut them to more equal widths.

&#x200B;

The next step is to line them up in a pattern you like. I preferred a more random look with this project but you could try all sorts of stuff... gradients... different angle cuts... imagination is your limit!

[Arranged 3\/4\\"" thick pieces as desired](https://preview.redd.it/5aws19lvmb741.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=077cf69d1c26e8f1c3d235d8cd131de58147693b)

After you've arranged the slats of wood, apply glue to \*each\* side of the face you are gluing. Do this in sections not wider than a foot or so (to reduce warping) and clamp together. After each section is dry glue all sections together and clamp together.

Next step is to create a form for your router sled. Mine is so... soooo much more rudimentary than this, [but this will give you an idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kLQ2tAsU4). Mine is basically [this](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Steelworks-1-1-4-in-W-x-1-1-4-in-H-x-6-ft-L-Zinc-Plated-Steel-Perforated-Round-Angle/3053569?cm_mmc=shp-_-c-_-prd-_-hdw-_-google-_-lia-_-213-_-threadedrodandmetalshapes-_-3053569-_-0&store_code=340&placeholder=null&gclsrc=ds) bolted to the actual router, and then just bracketing/screwing the cutting board in place so it doesn't move and running the router over it. The trick is to find the lowest point on your uneven board and adjust the router to that height; if your initial board is really uneven then you should find some middle ground so you're not blasting huge chunks out of it, but if you're here then you've got other issues.

[The supporting base and highest point of the frame should all be level](https://preview.redd.it/0jpnol5enb741.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a117829f89296b054062d5bd928a15999981921)

[You can see where the router stopped leveling if you look at the edges. I cut this part off.](https://preview.redd.it/qx1o6pjznb741.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18827ab13bb413d2f10e4e5481e6cc990c8a4b0f)

Next find the shortest edges and mark off your edges so that it is of even width. I made the first cut using a circular saw, and then ran it through the table saw to make it of consistent width.

The next step is to obsessively sand the heck out of the entire board. I started with 100 grit and worked up to 400. You can go as smooth as you want. I learned this from other failures but if your surface isn't smooth then the stain is going to absorb really unevenly and you will end up with splotchy... freckle-y wood grain.

[Create a \\""true\\"" edge with a track\/circular saw, then square off using table saw. Sand sand sand.](https://preview.redd.it/o12z8r8rnb741.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2dd281d592011e7dd298737d0d974bf0d324a82c)

Finally brew some coffee. Drink it. Now whatever is left (great use for leftover coffee) stick it in a pot on the stove and turn to medium heat. Reduce the coffee to about 50% of its original volume, and let cool. Next apply the coffee to the board, wipe away excess, repeat until board is desired darkness \*when wet\*.

[This is going to dry much much lighter. Keep staining until it's the desired darkness \_when wet\_](https://preview.redd.it/g8sgtj6aob741.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47e0713dc2bf96e738a27bbb37bbdcd2c15f1eb5)

In between coats enjoy some Mandalorian and whiskey. This step is mandatory.

[Whiskey makes a fine accompaniment to any project](https://preview.redd.it/p93lhle0pb741.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=083244af037fae021019332fe4cecea5b80808c6)

Finally, grease the heck out of the cutting board using a rag or brush, then wipe away excess. That's about it, now cut some meat, cheese, pickles, whatever-- and brag about how you made the board yourself ;)

I have taken up a project of redoing our laundry room tile floor. It is about 100 square feet. I started chipping away at the floor and realized the tile and thinset was quite easy to remove. However, I reached an area where the floor started to dip a lot and I ended up taking up the tile, thinset, and at least 1 inch of something (self levelling compound maybe?). 

I then decided to stop chipping away at the product underneath the tile and thinset and just started taking off the tiles (50 square feet). I am now left with a levelling job but this is new to me. Do I use self levelling compound to bring it up the inch or put down hardiebacker and then use self levelling compound or vice versa? I want it to look relatively level as it did before. See below for the pic of what I am talking about. 

Another question I have is how do I remove the thinset? Time is not a big issue I just want to make sure it is level. See picture below.

[Does this seem right to you guys](http://imgur.com/gallery/TsthTLM). Our brand new house came with a designated little cabinet for our wifi router. The whole thing is surrounded by a metal casing.

We have terrible reception, especially from downstairs. I would Prefer to have it [just above our staircase kind of on the banister, where the true center of the house is](http://imgur.com/gallery/qP0Hfch). In order to do that, I would have to get some longer cat5 cables to have this thing run out over there, maybe even use a tacky floor runner to hide the cable and tripping. I could have it at the doorway of my master bedroom, which is most likely what will happen. [This is the broadband adapter that limits me from physically moving it out of the box, unless I get a cat5 extender](http://imgur.com/gallery/Aub0VhG).

I even have a WiFi extender placed near the stairs where I want the router to be but it does a terrible job as well. More than likely because the router cabinet is encased in metal. Even with it open it does poorly. And it can't go far because of the cable setup our internet providers, Frontier, did. I will have to get a cat5 extender adapter in order to do so.

Do you guys have any simpler solution to what I believe is a terrible architectural design? I most likely will just drill a hole out of the cabinet so I can have easier access for the cables leading to the modem/router and have those sit in my master bedroom by my door.. closer to the center of the house. The biggest problem we have is that we get practically zero reception downstairs in our kitchen.. for obvious reasons.

My work to redo our master bedroom is coming to a close and I am almost at prime/paint. My question is this, the room has been repainted many times (1950's built house) and I had to do a lot of drywall patch work to fix settling cracks, lots of nail pops and cut some holes to run new electrical. In doing all of that, I have many areas where the repairs/patchwork has taken place are now extremely smooth, unlike the remainder of the wall, which has seen a lot of different paint over the years an is almost an ""orange peel/eggshell"" texture now from all the layers, but does not have any actual texture on it. I am planning on putting up 1-2 heavy coats of primer (Zinsser 123) with a large nap roller over the patches in an effort to get some of that same texture on the patches.  Followed by 1 full wall coat of the same primer and 2 coats of paint (SW Cashmere Flat Enamel), with those initial heavy applications and the remaining 3 coats, do you think I will get enough texture for those smooth areas to blend in with the rest of the wall?

Please let me know your thoughts, I am about a day away from being at paint and need to ideally finish this room by Jan. 2nd, so skim coating isn't really on the table at this point (although I know this is the best option). Any thoughts or ideas on the situation would be welcomed.

eg6o0q|2019-12-27 05:02:03|TV Mount, Lacking studs|"Alright, very beginner question. Want to mount a TV, holes in mount are 16 inch apart and studs are 24 inch apart. The mount came with HUD-L 8X60 plastic anchors so I'm not sure if I should try those or head to hardware shop to find some toggle anchors. The TV will be on a mount that doesn't move and it weighs 42 pounds. So I can certainly get screws on the left or right side of the mount but the middle would just be the drywall.

The other possible concern would be that the wall the mount will go on will be the drywall with r-20 pink insulation and the exterior on the other side. I had heard there could be an issue with losing heat. I've tried looking around and found various answers so any help would be greatly appreciated.

[https://imgur.com/a/IW8K2Iw](https://imgur.com/a/IW8K2Iw)

This was a neat project, and relatively quick.  It took one day to dig the foundation in and two days to build the structure.They were also short days (\~6 hours) because of winter cold/dark.  There was some time in between to let the adhesive between the blocks cure.

I did all the work by myself, except borrowing someone occasionally to tip the fully assembled structure onto the blocks.  With more than one person, you could probably knock this out in one day for the foundation and one day for construction.  I used a lot of clamps to position lumber and hold it in place while drilling and screwing. Clamping the polycarbonate roofing when cutting it was a big help.

Toolwise, I used a mitre saw, cordless drill/driver, jigsaw (for the polycarb roofing), hammer drill (for the tapcons in the foundation), tape measure, speed square.  You could do all the cutting the with a circular saw, a jigsaw, or even a hand saw if you had to.

I use treated lumber to keep costs down (vs cedar).  The slats and deck are deck boards (6 x 5/4 treated, rounded edges) which is, ironically cheaper than 1x6 treated boards, even though they are thinner.  I used Deckmate yellow-coated screws, except for the special screws for the polycarbonate roofing.  Total cost was probably \~$250 US, so more expensive than a commercial (metal) wood rack, but I like the look of it much better, and most of the commercial options have a canvas cover or tarp instead of a roof.

Note: It's important to predrill any holes near the edge of a board to prevent splitting.

It turned out to be challenging to get the roof angle correct.  I tried cutting the columns at the angle from the model, then using the roof frame to true up the columns, but it was hard to get everything aligned, and mine is not perfect.

I added 2x4 cross-braces at the top of the frame to the model and the cut list (they are not in my build).  If I was doing it again, I would use those braces to make the frame square and plumb without the roof and leave the columns long (not cut at an angle).  Then I would attach the roof frame at the desired angle and cut the columns off flush with a handsaw or circular saw.

I always thought there was a cold water pipe on the other side of the drywall. It was always colder to the touch than other parts of the ceiling. Makes sense. I went into the attic and dug under the insulation and there was no pipe, but instead I figured out that this line was right where 2 pieces of drywall meet. It looks like the drywall compound does not do a good job of changing temperature like the drywall does. The rest of the ceiling and walls don’t visibly condensate. I am about to repaint my bathrooms and I am wondering if I should paint everything with anti condensation paint or just that one spot or some other solution.

Is this a common issue with drywall joint compound? Does anyone have any experience with this or with fixing condensation issues?

1. These spacers that are being used don't seem great and I've looked at multiple installation videos online and no one is using anything like this. Are these spacers the best option for the installation of these shelves? Are there better ones I can find?  

2. In the videos I've seen online they have generally drilled a strip of wood into the side of the cabinet and mounted the slide hardware directly to that to get past the hinges. Is that the best practice or are there other alternatives?

When I turn the breaker Off / On the power doesn't come back and as soon as I press the TEST button the breaker trips. I'm only giving out this detail because I'm not sure if it should trip on its own or if the fact that it doesn't give power and only trips on ""TEST"" is an indication the breaker is faulty. 

I unplugged everything and that didn't help. Took apart the 15 outlets and nothing seemed out of order. Disconnected the outlet wires hoping to isolate the issue trough the upstream/downstream method and that got me nowhere. 

Ended up disconnecting the wires from all the outlets and making sure the wires don't touch to short - am I wrong to assume that the wires now being disconnected wouldn't cause a new reason for the breaker to trip, or would this indeed rule out the outlets as being the culprit?

I have a few similar breakers in the panel - could those be swapped in an attempt to rule out the breaker or is that a bad idea?

There are cutouts in the shed floor to anchor the shed to the concrete below it. Per the instructions I am using a 3/8 concrete drill bit to make the holes for the 3/8 anchoring screw and washer. 

I was supposed to use a 3/8 x 2"" screw but only found 3"" screws at my local store. I used my Milwaukee Impact Driver to drill the holes, but since the drill bit is only about 3.5-4"" long, I drilled almost all the way down to make enough room for the screw. 

Well... Now I can't get the drill bit out! 

I tried using reverse on the driver, tried wiggling it while ""drilling"" (both forward and reverse) to create more space for it to come out, tried pulling with pliers, tried manually rotating the bit counterclockwise but without any luck. With the impact driver the bit DOES rotate, but slowly. 

Please help!! Still need to make a few more holes to fully secure the shed. 

**2) Swingset**
The swingset was not meant to be anchored but I wanted some extra support. I purchased some Ground Anchors on Amazon. I inserted the anchors and now I am trying to secure the anchors to the legs of the swingset. In the picture above, there are two anchors next to the leg and the metal wire goes through a hole in the leg. I've never used this type of connector before.

I am trying to install a pull-up bar. However, the only appropriate place it can be attached to is slightly too small. I know that it will hold me with ease, since I weigh 70 kg and the maximum weighpower of the bar is 350 kg, but I am lost as in what to do now. I have not been able to find anything on the internet. Now I have come up with a few ""solutions"", but ive never done anything similar and have zero knowledge so i dont know which and if any of them is more fit.

First of all I was thinking that maybe it would be enough to just drill 4 instead of 8 screws straight into the wood. Another option would be drilling 4 instead of 8 of the provided plugs + screws isntead of using regular screws. I just dont know if it will hold and I dont know how I can find out. 

The other way would be drilling in the 4 of either screw, and then screwing a metal bracket underneath the wooden construction for the rest of the pull-up bar to lean against or even be attached to (is this even possible?)

I know you are big on doing on your own research, but I have not been able to find anything similar and I dont want to break my room. There is no other wall that could possibly hold the pull-upbar. There are no smaller bars to be found anywhere. I have included pictures of the wooden construction, the bar-part that should be attached to it and the provided plugs + screws.

LVP/EVP looks like a great solution on the balance sheet and for appearance. Several of the tiles were loose under the old refrigerator and are coming up easily, revealing a solid black underlayment without much adhesiveness to it.

eet1oi|2019-12-24 00:11:15|Do I have a Perimeter Drain in My Basement?|"I'm starting to finish off my basement, and doing a good deal of maintenance before framing it up to ensure no future issues.

I'm finishing up injecting a vertical wall crack that had a 1/8th crack in part of it, and sealing a couple 1/32"" vertical hairline shrinkage cracks, and was getting ready to use a polyurethane sealer to seal the wall and floor joints.

I had a radon fan system installed in the basement before we moved in, but the company that did it never sealed off the joints. They did show me before and after radon levels, showing me the system is working, so I never thought anything of it.

I noticed there are some metal ""fins / drip plate"" (not sure what to call them) sticking out above the floor in a few spots around the perimeter, and thought it might be part of a perimeter drain system that drains into my sump pit.

[Here's some pictures of what I'm looking at](https://imgur.com/a/tvFHvb5)

Neglect the mouse poop. That was a battle that I have won, and am now cleaning up...

My sump pit itself does not have a pump installed it in, but rather just a hole in the bottom and a metal piece of...something...coming from the side of it.

I obviously don't want to seal the perimeter off if this is in fact a drain system of some kind, but I honestly have no experience with basement drain systems, and wasn't sure.

If this is indeed a drain system, can I continue with my plan to put foam board up against the wall, with the glue attaching it to the wall applied in vertical stripes? I'd imagine if I ever have anything weep for whatever reason (the basement is dry and has never had a water problem that I'm aware of), it will still run behind the foam board without issue into the drain?"|turtal46|False|https://redd.it/eet1oi|0|0.5|0|6|1|diy

Long time lurker first time poster. I'm In a bit of a conundrum here with my 1929 home that has mostly cloth wiring. In our living room I noticed fixture wires sealed up and not used. My question is whether or not I can use this safely for a ceiling fan. Traditionally, I would bulldoze my stubborn self through and just hook it up, but this one has me scratching my head. 

&#x200B;

I have tested the wires and they are live. Also, when removing the switch for the side light fixtures that are the only lights that exist in the living I noticed what seems like a sealed up switch wires. I have had the home inspected for knob and tube pre-insulation work and the electrician (whom I think I trust?) said I was good.

&#x200B;

My question is, like the other fixtures in my home would it be OK to use this wiring? I find it weird that this was sealed up and side light fixtures were installed. You can see here that someone did work in the ceiling to this closed up junction box housing the closed wires.

&#x200B;

So I ask the DIY gods:

1. With this info, do you think it is a problem for me to do this install?
2. Would my prior approach of installing black to black and white to white after identifying the switch make the most sense? I'm pretty sure the capped wire on the right is the switch and the other 2 are power potentially supplying an outlet somewhere (I have seen this already elsewhere in the house).

BONUS

* Should I install 2 switches in a gang box or try to consolidate both switches into 1 in the junction box in the photo?

""I removed some wood veneer and studs in a house I just purchased to reveal a wall which looks to have had years of water intrusion. The parging has almost completely fallen off on the whole wall, and the top of the wall sounds hollow when knocked on. Interested in opinions on how bad this damage is, and how to go about repairing it.""

I'm a first time home buyer with interest in DIY repairs. I've never worked with cement/concrete but have been doing some research. I've got a contractor friend coming out to look at the wall in a week. Wondering if any of you have seen walls crumbling to this extent, and how I should approach fixing, or getting this fixed.

My fear is that all of the hollow parts of this wall will have to be removed. This means that the top 1-2 foot of the wall will need to come out and be replaced somehow. I'm hoping there is some way around this.

I've addressed what I believe was the main root of the problem. The gutters had not been cleaned out in when looked like years. Water was pouring out of the clogged gutters and landing directly by the foundation where most of the damage is. I fixed and cleaned the gutters. I still plan on sealing the wall from the outside, and grading around the foundation.

Any advice is appreciated."|Free_Woke|False|https://redd.it/eemskj|2|0.63|0|7|1|diy

[The back wall where the shelves will go, plus measurements.](https://preview.redd.it/kuw26uw5s9641.png?width=4608&format=png&auto=webp&s=40d33caa0094c88632d366d0dffea0b77c2f14e2)

As you can see, I have a server rack in the right corner that is 2' 7 3/8"" from the ceiling, and the electrical panel is also 2' 6 5/8"" from the ceiling. I can't make the shelves any taller than that because of those items, so the black and yellow bins in the picture can't be double stacked on the shelves. With the clearance I have, should I just go ahead and make the 2x4's coming down from the ceiling a cool 2' 6""? Am I going to have any code issues with the shelf immediately above the electrical panel? Since the right shelf in my model is just over 9' 6"", am I better off making it 8' (sheet of plywood length) with a gap between the door and the wall the panel is on? I'm planning on adding shelves to the left and right walls after these back shelves are complete and some floor space is opened up.

&#x200B;

Also, can I put a shelf in front of the water heater in the corner? Or am I better off just leaving a gap there? I thought about putting a section that can be easily removed if needed. But, again... I'm also looking at adding shelving to that far left wall that would be somewhat in front of the water heater anyway.

ee95y9|2019-12-22 19:35:35|Venting the bathroom to the roof or through the wall?|"I'm in the process of redoing my attic insulation, and correcting other issues along the way.  Chiefly among them is the fact that the bathroom fan simply vents directly into the attic, and not outside of the house.  Reading up on this, it looks like it cannot be vented out the roof peak (which I don't want to do anyway) or the soffits as moist air is liable to get sucked back in.  Thus, I think I'm left with only two options: a [roof vent](https://www.famcomfg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pbkx_2.jpg), or a [wall vent](https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/productImages/1000/d6/d685c7cd-3af2-4496-ba03-4ec6fe01028b_1000.jpg).

However, both of these seem to have some pretty bad drawbacks.  I live in the Midwest, where we're no strangers to snow, and I'm concerned that the roof vent could be blocked after a bad snowstorm or just accumulation over time.  Can a different style of vent be used that is more resilient to being blocked by snow if I decide to vent via the roof?  I also don't like putting any more holes in my roof than are absolutely necessary, as every new hole is another potential site for leaks.

A wall vent concerns me just a much though, as the nearest wall is ~18 ft away (see [this diagram](https://files.catbox.moe/g2kszo.png)).  The roof isn't that high above the ceiling there, and with such a long run, I assume I'd have to initially run the vent straight up, then slope it down as it goes horizontally, to expel as much condensation out the side of the house instead of back down to the fan.  I'm not sure if I'd have enough height to give a steep enough slope to expel the water.  Further complicating things if I go this this route, my house is entirely clear span trusses, so and a long rigid pipe running like this would restrict my movement between the center of the trusses and the soffits.  I like having access to wiring, junction boxes, and fixtures up there, so I try to minimize obstructions.

I bought a house (71 sq meters ground and first floor + 30sq meteres basement) that needs some renovating, it was basically untouched since its construction in the 1970s. It has tiles in every room.

Current heating solution is reversible AC, which is terrible so I'm thinking about the most optimum option. 

I began taking interest in floor heating but the installation scared me a little (cost, time, the need to clear everything in the house, raising the floors by 10-15cm).

So, for an electric floor heating the usual layers are insulation, heating mat and screed (usually concrete) before adding the final floor finish (in my case it will be laminated wood in the rooms and tiles in the bathroom/kitchen).

However I see some companies and home improvent stores proposing electric floor heating without the need of the screed layer. That facilitate the installation by a lot removing the time to wait for it to dry out and not raising the floor that much.

The problem is I can't find a lot of info about whether or not having a screed layer is mandatory or not.

What do you think about long term use of this heating solution ? Are they reliable in the long term ? In term of annual electricity bill ? Are they prone to failure (if they are I would guess not having a screed layer would be lot easier to fix) ?

edsbqs|2019-12-21 17:04:38|Narrow fireplace mantel shelf advice needed|"Hey everyone!

I'd like to build myself a mantle shelf for my natural gas fireplace, but I have a concern with heat, so I'm hoping for a bit of advice. My TV sits only about a foot above the top of the fireplace trim and approx 18"" from where the heat comes out. Naturally, this means that the heat reaches the TV very fast and could cause issues. The TV can't be mounted any higher, so I figured a mantel could be good to redirect the heat away. I found this easy DIY mantel online that I'm tempted to try ( [https://remingtonavenue.com/25-diy-wood-mantel.html](https://remingtonavenue.com/25-diy-wood-mantel.html) ) but my concern is that since it would be so close to the heat output, would the veneer survive the heat? Otherwise, maybe I could replace the bottom sheet of veneer with some kind of sheet metal? Any advice is appreciated. (I've added a picture of the area I'm working with, hopefully it shows up well). My ideal plan would be to make the mantel in the link, but with modified dimensions making it more rectangular (shelf-like) that square. This way, it would not only come out further from the wall which would help redirect the heat from the fireplace, but it would also be less tall, thus allowing me to put my soundbar on it with the limited space available.

Edit: Image didn't work, let's try it like this:  [https://i.imgur.com/qVuiAjQ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/qVuiAjQ.jpg)

Edit2: Thanks everyone for all the suggestions. To sum up some of the ideas I'll be trying from the comments, I'm scrapping the idea of a veneered box and going instead with a solid wood thick shelf using floating brackets (haven't decided on the lumber yet, but that can be done later). Also, since someone suggested I look up the owner's manual for the fireplace, that taught me about the existence of a blower kit. I found one on Amazon for under 100CAD, so I'll give it a shot and see what happens. I'm sure it'll help a lot, and if for some reason it doesn't, well it should at least help keep my feet toasty, lol. Lastly, someone asked about temperature, and while I couldn't find anything on my specific model, I see that overall LCD TVs shouldn't be in temperatures above \~105F, and after running my fireplace at the lowest setting for about 10 minutes, the bottom edge of my TV is registering at 130F (as measured using a laser thermometer). Mind you, that's without either a blower or a mantel, so this is really the worst case scenario (and no, the TV wasn't turned on during this test, silly people!)

The main water heater is on the opposite side of the house and takes a full minute to actually get warm water to sink.

After shopping around, several models state they must be hard-wired, i.e. not plugged into an outlet. (I don't know *why* it's supposed to be that way, but several of them explicitly state that)

I'd be running a new wire on a new breaker to install this.

edrt5q|2019-12-21 16:24:14|Looking for advice on how to address insulating an attic space with plumbing|"Howdy Redditors,

I just recently had a new roof and gutters put on and while some of the estimates included insulation and venting, I didn’t opt for it nor was there any confidence in the solutions. So, I turn to you for your suggestions on how I might go about a good solution on my own.

We inherited a small attic space at the front of our bungalow. The attic is home to plumbing for a second story bathroom. Over the couple of years we’ve been in the home we’ve had issues with ice dams on this side of the house in particular.

I’m still seeing melting patterns on the roof that are evident that heat is escaping through or between the insulation, through the wood, I suppose? And clearly I need some amount of heat in this space to keep the pipes from bursting.

So, I ask, what’s a viable plan of action here? Rerouting the pipes is probably not something we’d be willing or able to do at this point. Do we insulate the pipes and remove the roof insulation? Increase the R value of the insulation? Spray foam? Call a professional?

I have a positive item I will use to create the mold that has no lettering on it. I would like to create a mold that will imprint lettering on the casted object. 

The object I’m casting is about 4 inches and the text will be relatively small, so I will need to be able to catch fine details in high resolution. 

I was thinking the steps would be:

1. Create mold with the positive item
2. Use the mold and cast a positive item from a material that can be imprinted with letters after casting
3. Use the new positive that has had lettering imprinted in it to create a new silicone mold that has the lettering
4. Cast with concrete

If this is the best way to do it, what recommendations do you have for the intermediate casting material that I can imprint with lettering after casting?

If you have an alternative method for accomplishing this, please let me know, I am all ears.

My son's room has two switches on the wall, one for light and other presumably for fan. The original fan had pull chains for light and fan. Replacement fan has a remote.

Coming out of the junction box on the ceiling is a red, white and black.

The receiver has black and white which instructions indicate should be connected to black and white respectively from the ceiling.

Leading out of the receiver are black, white blue and orange, wihh instructions indicating that these are to be matched to the same colored wires on the light/fan unit.

If I leave the red wire disconnected, nothing works. I've also tried the following with various limited success.

1. Red, (ceiling) black, (receiver in) black = nothing

2. Red, (receiver in) black = nothing

3. Red, (receiver out) black, (fan) black = fan operational with switch, remote and light doesn't work

4. Red, (receiver out) blue, (light) blue = light operational with switch, remote and fan doesn't work

The orange wire is labeled 'up light' - I've not yet tried connecting it here - afraid to damage something.

Green/ground is also connected.

I've searched and probably reviewed top 15 or 20 results, and tried a suggestion about leaving the red wire uncapped.

He built a floating floor structure using the existing floor joists. Then on top of that he laid multiplex panel of 18mm thickness + aquapanel board of 18mm.

The floor seemed rigid enough so he glued on top of the aquapanel using powder tile cement 30 x 60 cm tiles. The tiles seemed well stuck and so he grouted with flexible powder grout with 3mm between the tiles.

After a few days he noticed one tile was ""clicking"" on a heavy walking area. He decided to fix it later and after three weeks he noticed that the grout is cracking on the heavy walking path (from shower to the bathroom door) in between the tiles and along where the floor meets the wall tile.

After some research he thinks the simplest/easiest/cheapest solution would be to scrape out the old grout and replace it with a more flexible grout along the lines of Bal Admix or Dunlop's flexible grout.

The total of the surface area of the floor is 1m2.

Wish I could say that about the previous homeowners ""handyman"". They were an older couple and I'm assuming they believed he was knowledgeable about most things. He remodeled the downstairs bathroom about 6 months before we purchased the home.

Since then I've had to re-tile the shower, since he didn't set the tiles deep enough in the floor thin set for them to bind properly. A few months into owning the home and the grout was breaking out and tiles were coming loose. I fixed it, and it's been good for a few years. Started making me wonder what else he screwed up.

This particular bathroom is in an addition with a flat roof. It has a black EPDM roof covering. The only penetration in the roof is the toilet vent. One day I'm brushing my teeth and I'm looking up at the exhaust fan grille. Suddenly I was like ""Wait, where the hell is that venting too?"" And I'm sure you guys can guess by my title what he did. Literally just ran some duct work off the fan outlet and laid it between the rafters. Fortunately, there was no mold or water damage that I could see and the fan itself had a small electrical saddle that you could unclip to disable the fan (the circuit is also connected to the light over the shower, so it's nice to be able to still use it without the fan running).

My dilemma: I don't necessarily want to punch a hole in the roof. It's getting near the end of its life and I don't want to open up Pandora's box. Also, we do get appreciable snow from time to time, so even a capped or elbow vent could be too low and could allow snow in. I'm thinking I might just 86 the exhaust fan and figure out a way to wire up a wall vent and exhaust through the bathroom wall onto our covered porch, using the existing fan wiring...but then I'm looking at some drywall work, wall penetrations, etc. I am planning on having the roof completely redone in the next calendar year. Should I just leave the fan unused and see if I can't come up with a roof vent solution at that time? Mold isn't a big issue right now, but I'd really like to be able to use the fan for it's intended function.

So far I seem to be having some success in removing the thicker layers off of smooth surfaces by spraying it down with a light detergent and wiping it up with a towel which I then rinse out in a bucket and giving the surface another wipe over with a dry towel. Although there still seems to be a light residue when it’s dry. Is there a better way of doing this?

Other challenges I’m facing that I could use advice on are:

1. Fabric surfaces such as suitcases – What’s the best way to get dust out of these? Vacuum?
2. Would it be worth hiring a wet/dry vac with a HEPA filter?
3. My laundry is in the garage and subsequently my dry has been covered by the dust. How clean would the area have to be before I can use this again without sucking dust all through the family’s clothes? Is there a way to test for silica particles in the air?
4. Am I overreacting to the risks here at all? Just really concerned about exposing my kids to it through their clothing etc.

Thanks guys, can’t believe I was so stupid to get into this mess."|PercyFromBlackAdder|False|https://redd.it/ecrg5u|3|0.72|0|3|1|diy

eclpnd|2019-12-19 01:07:33|Advice regarding warm rooms during winter|"Not 100% sure if this is the place to go, but I thought I'd give it a shot.

It's winter right now, pretty regular temperatures, nothing under 10 Fahrenheit.

In my apartment it gets really warm as there are building-wide AC vents that spew warm air during the winter and I have a computer that can obviously raise a room's temperature over time as well as various electronics that any regular home would have. The window AC units don't work during this time of year as it's just way too cold outside to run any properly. Fans only do so much as eventually it's just blowing hot air around the place.

We're kinda nervous about this heating issue as my girlfriend has a medical condition where she becomes delirious and nauseous when she gets too warm.

Any advice would be much appreciated."|lil_jimbo|False|https://redd.it/eclpnd|13|0.79|0|16|1|diy

If you never heard of Tile: https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/

I have a flat Tile GPS tracker, not the small thick one with the keychain hole, but the larger thinner ones that you’re supposed to stick on stuff.

But I want to use it in a keychain so I want to drill a hole on its corner somewhere. Has anyone ever tried this? Is there a safe spot on the thing where there’s no hardware inside?

Thanks for the answers!"|VonThing|False|https://redd.it/ecmber|5|0.63|0|9|1|diy
