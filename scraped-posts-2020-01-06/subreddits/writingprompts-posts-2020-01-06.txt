ekxoc4|2020-01-06 18:02:09|[OT] Spotlight - knife211|"##Writers Spotlight
***********

This week's spotlight writer is **knife211**!

I can’t begin to tell you how much I love u/knife211. In the subreddit and on our Discord, she is one of my favorite people. Though we have butted heads a few times in the past, we’ve also had long discussions about various topics, and I’m truly glad for the opportunity. She is a bright person, positive, and upbeat. She brings light to our community.

On top of being a good person, she’s an excellent writer. I’m particularly fond of her entries in Theme Thursday, even moreso when I get to hear them read aloud. She’s also one part of the group of folks who submit regular IPs, something we definitely need more of.

You can find a selection of stories and an ongoing serial on her sub, r/AsterSerials. Poke her about writing more while you’re there!

Thank you for being a good friend, knife211. Congratulations!

***********

Spotlight relies on your nominations. If you see a writer who has been around the sub for a while, who has at least six (or more!) high quality submissions, and who hasn't been given the Spotlight before, send us a modmail and let us know!

**********

Here are some of u/knife211’s top prompt responses:

##This Week’s Challenge

&nbsp;

Alright! A new year is here and this month I want to try and get some new types of stories from you all! I’ve been keeping the constraints pretty condusive to [RF] style things — 'Smashception' not withstanding — but I am going to try and stretch that into a few different genres this month. Each week will only have 1 Story feature, but it will be worth 6 points and be a genre. I hope you’ll come along for the ride and try your hand at different styles! 

&nbsp;


###How to Contribute

&nbsp;

Write a story or poem, **no more than 800 words** in the comments using **at least two** things from the three categories below.  The more you use, the more points you get.  Because yes!  There are points! You have until 11:59 PM EST Saturday to submit a response.

&nbsp;

Category | Points
---|---
Word List | 1 Point
Sentence Block | 2 Points
Defining Feature | 6 Points

&nbsp;


####**Word List**
---

* Evidence

* Culprit

* Shadows

* Badge

&nbsp;

####**Sentence Block**
---

* The cycle came to an end, just to begin again.

* It wasn’t the first time we’d come across something like this.



&nbsp;

####**Defining Features**
---

* Genre: Mystery - Since this is only 800 words you don’t have to solve the mystery obviously. I am just looking for you to follow some of the stylistic elements of the genre. Remember not all mysteries are dark and somber; feel free to be lighthearted too!

***

Hellena’s finger wrapped tighter against her wooden walking stick. The wood was old; made from the first tree that had ever grown on her land. It was polished yet chipped and worn from the ages.  The wood felt cool on her clammy skin. Even when the weather was warm, the wood was cool and refreshing to hold.  

It was one of it’s better attributes.  

Leaning just a little more of her weight on her quiet yet faithful companion, she searched the darkening space in the front of her. Her feet adjusted by centimeters below her, feeling the dirt underneath them and hoping the transaction would be soon. The stars were coming out but they were no replacement for the fading sunlight. She didn’t like to bring torches out to meetings since it could make the children uncomfortable. 

Most of them already panicked when she grabbed their hand.  

She didn’t blame them. Their mothers walked away, and Hellena’s hands were gnarled and scarred. A heavy sigh left her mouth, accompanied by a small groan of impatience. Her heart was beating in her chest a little faster than she would have liked. As if there was a reason for *her* to be nervous. 

Before her anxiety could ramp up any further, she heard muffled voices at the edge of the woods. Two bodies walked along the path, into the dusk just beyond the trees. The conversation was high pitched, and as they got closer they got louder. By the time the mother and her daughter stood in front of Hellena, the boy was yelling; panic was written all over his face. It was exactly the way she expected it to go down — his mother had done nothing to soothe him on the way. 

It always happened, but she wished it didn't. There were a thousand stories she could have told him, yet she didn’t. Despite the mounting frustration at the woman, Hellena forced a smile on her face. She could feel the wrinkles on her face deepened as she did so. Age, and time, and stress, and dealing with assholes had all worn badly on her. 

“I’m glad you both could make it,” she said. She heard the voice that left her. It was not sweet, or motherly. Sometimes she wished it could be when she wanted, but without casting magic on herself or others, she couldn’t be something she wasn’t.  Her husky voice caught in her throat as it rolled out of her. 

A character of herself as she tried to play nice for a moment. 

“I still think you should have just met me in the city,” the woman said harshly while trying to keep her son from pulling her arm and shoulder any further down. She shot her face down as he buckled and yanked her with him. Her lips pulled into a snarl for a second before it disappeared again. She sunk and met him face to face. “You’ll be staying with our friend for a little while.” Her lips pulled upwards into a shallow and weak smile. 

Hellena felt her heart sink. The deals where always the worst when the conversations mattered. Her limbs wouldn’t let her sink down to meet them both in the middle, instead, she extended her free hand towards him, and pulled a smile on her face as well. “You can make the hot chocolate.” 

The boy turned to her. His hands were still gripping tightly to his mother, but his thoughts were churning, visible on his face. 

“We can ladle it out of the really big pot in the stone kitchen. It even sits on a real campfire.”

The boy looked up at his mother, and then back at Hellena.  

“Just for a while,” the mother repeated. 

After a few tenuous moments, the old woman and the young boy had walked down her path, into her home, and closed the door behind them. Inside the breezes didn’t blow, and the trees didn’t sing their peaceful song. It was warm and dry, quiet save the crackling of the fire in one corner.  

“What does a while mean?” the boy asked, his hand gripping hers as if even inside safety was assured.  The question he was asking wasn’t the question he had voiced. He didn’t look to be a stupid child. 

He looked to be the type that helped take care of his mom more than he ought, even before he approached double digits.  

Hellena gently tugged her hand, glad when he let her move without much resistance. She walked away from the door, leaning her cane against the adjacent wall. “What’s your name?” she asked as she moved into the kitchen. 

A little limp slowed her down; but in this place steeped in remedy and time, she could almost move around with ease.  

“Henry.”  

She smiled. “A strong name you have, Henry.” Stretching her legs as she stood on her toes, she pulled down several tins and then moved to grab 2 short mugs. She carried it all back to where he stood, keeping her eyes focused on his when she got there. “A strong name for a strong boy.” 

One corner of his mouth twitched slightly at her compliment. His eyes moved toward the items she had in her arms, but he didn’t make another noise. 

“I admit it,” she said. “It’s a bribe.” She turned and walked over to her cauldron. It was not for hot chocolate. But she had scrubbed it clean, and she wanted her new charge to have a special treat to put him at ease. 

A while meant a lifetime, is what she wanted to tell him as she set the mugs on a small neazirby table. 

It meant that he was hers and that his mother didn’t know that the hot chocolate had been real and that his mother didn’t know who the favor was really for. It wasn’t for the Hellena, and it wasn’t for herself. 

It was for Henry, a thing she knew in every skin cell and every bone fiber. She glanced at his face as she opened the first tin.  

Henry’s eyes were a little bit wider. Trepidation sat on him like it never intended to leave, but she hoped it would. She had taken care of smaller boys than him; boys with less strength and less soul. She would take in countless children before time caught up to her, and she didn’t regret a single second of it. 

She watched as his hands took the tin from him, and poured the brown powder into the black pot. The corners of his mouth twitched again.  

“Have you ever made it yourself?” she asked, exchanging tins with him.  She carried the empty one back to the kitchen while he poured the sugar in the cauldron, and she carried a pitcher of water back with her to add-in. She didn’t try to make him do it — the weight would have made a mess and she wanted everything light. 

Everything simple for just a day.  

“Yes,” he answered as he watched the water pour through the air. “But never like this.” 

Hellena hoped for a lifetime of that answer, in earnest. May just one child’s life be hot cocoa and campfires and magic and hope.  A smile crept over her face, and when she looked back down again to hand him a long wooden spoon, she saw his mouth curved upwards too.
