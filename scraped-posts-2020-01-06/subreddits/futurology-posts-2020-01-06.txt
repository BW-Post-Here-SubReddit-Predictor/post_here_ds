This could allow us to calculate how much energy might be required. Its also incredibly convenient that we know how to work with sound waves so well. Like for example the ability to completely localize the actual sound will probably be pretty useful for this purpose.

Highways

Railroads

Parking Lots

Utility lines

Storage tanks

Maybe you want to live like an ant and have your home underground

The point is, it's a long list, and the reason we don't do it is, as always, money. Removing rock is expensive work, done with excavators, tunnel boring machines, and dynamite. So instead of removing the rock, why don't we just melt it? 

This idea was considered, then abandoned, in the 70s. Researchers in Los Alamos [proposed a machine](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/americas-mad-scientists-wanted-use-nuclear-power-create-tunnels-shocking-way-40072) that would use the incredible heat of a nuclear reactor to slice through rock like a hot knife through butter. It was never developed. Other ideas include [microwaves](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674775515001341) and [lasers](https://www.industrial-lasers.com/cutting/article/16484724/earth-boring-with-laser-energy). 

Energy costs are tremendous, which is why it's never been done, but we've got [extremely low cost solar power](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/eitilz/the_implications_of_extremely_low_cost_power/) on the horizon, solving that problem. 

And because these machines would go faster, require less maintenance, and merely push rock out of the way instead of having to remove it leaving glassy walls that would require less finishing, they could be much less expensive. This will allow us to build a lot more underground."|kernals12|False|https://redd.it/ek8mmm|7|0.69|0|8|1|futurology

ek10nr|2020-01-04 19:19:09|Hybrid Powered Helicopters|"Airbus wants to fly a [hybrid electric helicopter](https://www.helicopterinvestor.com/articles/airbus-wants-to-fly-a-hybrid-electric-helicopter-next-year-661/) this year. I find it odd that so much hype has gone into passenger drones but not the humble helicopter which has proven itself since Igor Sikorsky piloted the first one on a field in Connecticut over 80 years ago. They have found a niche, but their obvious mass market uses, that were predicted in the 50s and 60s, have been held back by problems of noise, maintenance, and fuel economy. With hybrid power, these problems could finally be fixed. For one thing, having a turbine engine act as a generator that provides power to electric motors that turn the rotors, offers far more mechanical simplicity than the current systems with all their gearboxes, differentials, and bearings. One of the big problems with helicopters is that as the engine pushes the rotor in one direction, it creates an equal and opposite force that pushes the fuselage in the other direction, in order to stop this spin, you usually have a tail rotor that cancels out the torque. That tail rotor creates lots of noise, adds complexity, and the power needed to turn it hurts fuel economy. 

But there's another way, [the coaxial rotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_rotors), which has two main rotors, one on top of another, spinning in opposite directions, eliminates the need for a tail rotor. This means less noise, better efficiency, and vastly improved safety. But the reason it's not used frequently is the added complexity from having the rotors spin in opposite directions, requiring a gearbox sandwiched between the two rotors, which is just another thing that can break. 

But with hybrid power, you could just have an electric motor turning the second rotor, which has few moving parts and is less likely to break. 

Further improvements in noise will come from blades that can change their shape to prevent blade vortex interaction, which is where one blade hits the vortex left behind by the blade in front of it. 

So with less noise, better fuel economy, and less complexity, the hybrid powered helicopter will be a very useful tool instead of a mere novelty. It'll bring the benefits of air travel to short distances. Large choppers, able to carry 20-30 passengers, will expand the radius of commuters as they fly at 150 mph over traffic jams. Banks, insurance companies, law firms, and ad agencies will no longer need to be downtown, not when clients can easily fly to far flung suburban office parks. 

The places that are isolated from large metro areas due to mountains or bodies of water will be easily accessible. Los Angeles will now be able to sprawl north past the San Gabriel Mountains and Seattle can spread west past the Puget Sound.

We'll have more air ambulances and police helicopters, speeding up emergency response times. There can be more tours done by chopper. 

Helicopters have been held back from their great potential for a long time now, hopefully hybrid power enables them to revolutionize our lives the way they were always meant to."|kernals12|False|https://redd.it/ek10nr|4|0.69|0|0|1|futurology
ek0mi5|2020-01-04 18:50:14|Nootropics are natural and synthetic compounds|"Nootropics are natural and synthetic compounds that facilitate cerebral circulation, memory retention, and enhanced concentration. They are sometimes called ""smart drugs."" The story of nootropics began with Dr. Corneliu E. Giurgea, the recognized father of cognitive pharmacology. In 1964, Dr. Giurgea synthesized piracetam, the world's first nootropic. It is a derivative of the neurotransmitter GABA and has purportedly shown clinical efficacy in treating neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's. At present, the FDA does not recognize the racetam group of synthetic compounds as federally controlled substances. This means that piracetam is not a legally recognized drug. However, there are studies proving its efficacy. 

In 1977, a double-blind study found that piracetam improved geriatric memory over a two-month period. Meanwhile, a recent 2013 study indicated that piracetam was key in improving the short-term cognitive performance of patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Still another study in 2016 showed that piracetam improved mitochondrial function, a key strategy in treating early-stage cognitive decline. Considering this, the question begs to be asked: How do consumers recognize a true nootropic from a counterfeit one? To guide us, Dr. Giurgea released his definition of a beneficial nootropic: A true nootropic must enhance learning and memory ability.  It should provide neurological protection against oxidative damage.  It should decrease cortical and subcortical dysfunction. It should aid the brain in retaining learned behaviors and memory functions under disruptive conditions. 

Are Nootropics Safe? Many consumers question the safety of these supplements. So, are nootropics safe? It depends. Although nootropics are generally derived from synthetic ingredients, some herbs can also be classified as nootropic in nature. Such herbs include ginseng, ashwagandha, schisandra, gotu kola, rosemary, sage, calamus, and bacopa. It's imperative that consumers do thorough research before including nootropics in their diet. On the other hand, nootropic supplements like Modafinil have been on the US market since 1998; it can be obtained through a doctor's prescription. One study showed that Modafinil increased the cognitive performance of helicopter pilots who had been awake for two 40-hour periods. It's no secret that Modafinil is popularly known as the Limitless drug (based off the 2011 Limitless Movie)."|BrianJRose|False|https://redd.it/ek0mi5|5|0.59|0|2|1|futurology

ek0hbj|2020-01-04 18:39:59|SLOWING DOWN THE AGING PROCESS|"**Have you ever wondered if you could pause your life in your mid-twenties? Have you ever dreamt of slowing down your body's aging process and living for longer? Is there any real factual and scientific possibility behind these wishes? Maybe it could all be possible simply by eating a lot less.**

**There are several certain constants within a human's life. We are born, we live, and we die. Part of the simple process includes the concept of aging, an intrinsic and fundamental feature of life that has fascinated humanity for hundreds of years. This topic as cropped up many a time on screen and within literature throughout history and remains a popular sci-fi tool to this day, especially within hit TV shows such as Doctor Who. However, on paper, the process of aging is a relatively simple one. As we grow older, certain stem cells without our bodies lose the ability to regenerate, thus leaving us open to attack from nasty infections, diseases, and other conditions. One example of this that we would like to focus on is the human intestinal stem cells, which, once they lose the ability to regenerate, find it far harder to recover from gastrointestinal infections and other intestinal issues.**

**Research from a group of MIT biologists has now revealed that you can reverse these effects of aging on the intestine with a simple 24-hour fast. By observing the effects of fasting on groups of both old and young mice, the MIT team found that stem cells have the ability to regenerate in these conditions. While in a state of fasting, the cells within the mice subjects started to break down fatty acids rather than glucose, which in turn boosted stem cell regeneration. Not only this, but the MIT team then discovered that they could achieve the same effects with the addition of a molecule, a breakthrough that could benefit older humans when it comes to recovering from intestinal infections or even chemotherapy.** 

**Senior Author on the MIT paper, David Sebatini, explained: “This study provided evidence that fasting induces a metabolic switch in the intestinal stem cells, from utilizing carbohydrates to burning fat. Interestingly, switching these cells to fatty acid oxidation enhanced their function significantly. Pharmacological targeting of this pathway may provide a therapeutic opportunity to improve tissue homeostasis in age-associated pathologies.”** 

**Further studies into the mice and the effects of fasting found that the state of fasting doubled the regenerative abilities of the intestinal stem cells, as explained by Lead Author on the paper, Maria Mihaylova.**

**She said: ""It was obvious that fasting had this immense effect on the ability of intestinal crypts to form more organoids, which is stem-cell-driven. This was something that we saw in both the young mice and the aged mice, and we wanted to understand the molecular mechanisms driving this.""**

**The idea of fasting slowing the process of aging is not limited to this MIT study either, as research out of the Kyoto University and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University has reinforced the concept.**

**In this study, four human subjects were asked to fast for 34 and then 58 hours to see what effect it would have on the body and the aging process. Although the results were gathered from this small pool of data, they were incredible, revealing that 44 substances increased in the human body through the process of fasting. Not only this, but many of these substances are known to decrease when a person ages, yet they increased by a factor of between 1.5 and 60 during the experiment. These metabolites, such as leucine, isoleucine, and ophthalmic acid, increasing during fasting seems to suggest that the act may indeed help people to live longer.**

**Technician and first author of the paper on this research, Dr. Takayuki Teruya said: “These are very important metabolites for maintenance of muscle and antioxidant activity, respectively. This result suggests the possibility of a rejuvenating effect by fasting, which was not known until now.**

**“Recent aging studies have shown that caloric restriction and fasting have a prolonging effect on lifespan in model animals, but the detailed mechanism has remained a mystery. It might be possible to verify the anti-aging effect from various viewpoints by developing exercise programs or drugs capable of causing metabolic reaction like fasting.**

**“People are interested in whether human beings can enjoy the effects of prevention of metabolic diseases and prolonging life span by fasting or caloric restriction, as with model animals. Understanding the metabolic changes caused by fasting is expected to give us wisdom for maintaining health.”**

**While these findings are extremely interesting and are potentially ground-breaking when it comes to delaying aging effects, they do not look at data over a full life cycle. It would not be possible to conduct such an experiment using humans, but researchers from Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health found a way around this by using C. elegans. These are nematode worms that live just a matter of two weeks, allowing the scientists to observe and record their entire life span.**

**The mitochondrial networks within cells usually switch between fused and fragmented. However, the study found that by restricting the diets of these worms or mimicking such an act through AMPK, the mitochondria remained fused into a state of youth. This also increased the lifespan of the worms in general. So, in short, you may be able to pause and extend your lifespan through the simple practice of fasting, or by using proteins that mimic the same results.**

**The lead author, Heather Weir, said: “Low-energy conditions such as dietary restriction and intermittent fasting have previously been shown to promote healthy aging. Understanding why this is the case is a crucial step toward being able to harness the benefits therapeutically. Our findings open new avenues in the search for therapeutic strategies that will reduce our likelihood of developing age-related diseases as we get older.**

**“Although previous work has shown how intermittent fasting can slow aging, we are only beginning to understand the underlying biology. Our work shows how crucial the plasticity of mitochondria networks is for the benefits of fasting. If we lock mitochondria in one state, we completely block the effects of fasting or dietary restriction on longevity.""**"|BrianJRose|False|https://redd.it/ek0hbj|0|0.47|0|3|1|futurology

The manufacturers of these meats boast that they use 99% less land than traditional methods. That is a lot. We use [A LOT of land](https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/the-us-is-cow-country-and-other-lessons-from-this-land-use-map) for raising animals. In the US, 654 million acres is used for pasture and another 122 million is used for growing animal feed (not counting the additional amount used for feed exports) for a total of 781 million acres, that's an area twice the size of Alaska. Anyone who's flown cross country can see how the raising of animals dominates our landscape. 

We must seriously consider what will happen once all this land is rendered useless. 

The communities near metro areas will have no choice but to end their resistance to the tide of urban sprawl as property tax revenue dries up. Rather than scorning sprawl, we shall praise it for saving many places from the grave. Those that aren't so lucky will go under. There will be a lot of ghost towns on the Great Plains. 

We can be sure that a lot will be bought up by conservationist groups who will use them it to plant trees. Today, in Connecticut, you can find rock walls going through forests for seemingly no reason, the legacy of farms long gone.

eizjpg|2020-01-02 15:24:39|Kurzweil's 2009 was our 2019|"From ""How My Predictions Are Faring"" with all instances of ""2009"" replaced with ""2019"". These are all of mid-90s Ray Kurzweil's predictions for 2009, dating back to *The Age of Spiritual Machines*. It's almost uncanny how precise he was so long as you shift the accuracy by a decade. I'd say roughly 80% of his predictions accurately called the present day. Funnily enough, the ones that missed the mark were the ones he himself said were wrong. His main problem was trying to predict the consumer success of various technologies.

Also, don't be ultra-pedantic about some wording, like 'portable computer'. Remember that he wrote all this in the mid-90s before terms like 'smartphone' and 'Cloud' were common or even coined (in fact, I've gone ahead and put some of these modern terms in there if it's obvious that's what he was referring to).

__________________

1. Individuals primarily use portable computers.
1. Portable computers will have become dramatically lighter and thinner than the notebook computers of ten years earlier.
1. Personal computers are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes, and are commonly embedded in clothing and jewelry such as wristwatches, rings, earrings and other body ornaments.
1. Computers with a high-resolution visual interface range from rings and pins and credit cards up to the size of a thin book.
1. People typically have at least a dozen computers on and around their bodies, which are networked using “body LANs” (local area networks).
1. For the most part, these truly personal computers have no moving parts. Memory is completely electronic.
1. Most portable computers do not have keyboards.
1. Most users have servers in their homes and offices where they keep large stores of digital “objects,” including their software, databases, documents, music, and movies.
1. Digital objects such as books, music albums, movies, and software are rapidly distributed as data files through the wireless network, and typically do not have a physical object associated with them.
1. Most users have servers where they keep digital “objects” such as virtual reality environments (although these are still at an early stage).
1. There are services to keep one’s digital objects in central repositories, but most people prefer to keep their private information under their own physical control.
1. Cables are disappearing. Communication between components, such as pointing devices, microphones, displays, printers, and the occasional keyboard uses short-distance wireless technology.
1. Computers routinely include wireless technology to plug into the ever-present worldwide network, providing reliable, instantly available, very high bandwidth communication.
1. The majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition (CSR) dictation software, but keyboards are still used. CSR is very accurate, far more so than the human transcriptionists who were used up until a few years ago.
1. Also ubiquitous are language user interfaces (LUIs), which combine continuous speech recognition (CSR) and natural language understanding. For routine matters, such as simple business transactions and information inquiries, LUIs are quite responsive and precise. They tend to be narrowly focused, however, on specific types of tasks. LUIs are frequently combined with animated personalities. Interacting with an animated personality to conduct a purchase or make a reservation is like talking to a person using videoconferencing, except that the person is simulated.
1. Computer displays have all the display qualities of paper — high resolution, high contrast, large viewing angle, and no flicker. Books, magazines, and newspapers are now routinely read on displays that are the size of, well, small books.
1. Computer displays built into eyeglasses are also used. These specialized glasses allow users to see the normal visual environment, while creating a virtual image that appears to hover in front of the viewer. The virtual images are created by a tiny laser built into the glasses that projects the images directly onto the user’s retinas.
1. Computers routinely include moving picture image cameras and are able to reliably identify their owners from their faces.
1. In terms of circuitry, three-dimensional chips are commonly used, and there is a transition taking place from the older single-layer chips.
1. Sound producing speakers are being replaced with very small chip-based devices that can place high-resolution sound anywhere in three-dimensional space. This technology is based on creating audible frequency sounds from the spectrum created by the interaction of very high frequency tones. As a result, very small speakers can create very robust three-dimensional sound.
1. A $1,000 personal computer can perform about a trillion calculations per second.
1. Supercomputers match at least the hardware capacity of the human brain — 20 million billion calculations per second (20 petaflops).
1. Unused computes on the Internet are being harvested, creating virtual parallel supercomputers with human brain hardware capacity.
1. There is increasing interest in massively parallel neural nets, genetic algorithms and other forms of “chaotic” or complexity theory computing, although most computer computations are still done using conventional sequential processing, albeit with some limited parallel processing.
1. Autonomous nanoengineered machines (i.e., machines constructed atom by atom and molecule by molecule) have been demonstrated and include their own computational controls. However, nanoengineering is not yet considered a practical technology.
1. Research has been initiated on reverse-engineering the human brain through both destructive scans of the brains of recently deceased persons as well as noninvasive scans using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of living persons and animals.
1. In the twentieth century, computers in schools were mostly on the trailing edge, with most effective learning from computers taking place in the home. Now in 2019, while schools are still not on the cutting edge, the profound importance of the computer as a knowledge tool is widely recognized.
1. Computers play a central role in all facets of education, as they do in other spheres of life.
1. The majority of reading is done on displays, although the “installed base” of paper documents is still formidable.
1. The generation of paper documents is dwindling, as the books and other papers of largely twentieth-century vintage are being rapidly scanned and stored.
1. Documents, circa 2019, routinely include embedded moving images and sounds.
1. Students of all ages typically have a computer of their own, which is a thin tablet-like device weighing under a pound with a very high-resolution display suitable for reading.
1. Students interact with their computers primarily by voice and by pointing with a device that looks like a pencil.
1. Keyboards still exist, but most textual language is created by speaking.
1. Learning materials are accessed through wireless communication.
1. Intelligent courseware has emerged as a common means of learning.
1. Recent controversial studies have shown that students can learn basic skills such as reading and math just as readily with interactive learning software as with human teachers, particularly when the ratio of students to human teachers is more than one to one. Although the studies have come under attack, most students and their parents have accepted this notion for years.
1. The traditional mode of a human teacher instructing a group of children is still prevalent, but schools are increasingly relying on software approaches, leaving human teachers to attend primarily to issues of motivation, psychological well-being, and socialization.
1. Many children learn to read on their own using their personal computers before entering grade school.
1. Preschool and elementary school children routinely read at their intellectual level using print-to-speech reading software until their reading skill level catches up.
1. These print-to-speech reading systems display the full image of documents, and can read the print aloud while highlighting what is being read.
1. Synthetic voices sound fully human.
1. Although some educators expressed concern in the early ‘00 years that students would rely unduly on reading software, such systems have been readily accepted by children and their parents.
1. Studies have shown that students improve their reading skills by being exposed to synchronized visual and auditory presentations of text.
1. Learning at a distance (e.g., lectures and seminars in which the participants are geographically scattered) is commonplace.
1. Learning is becoming a significant portion of most jobs.
1. Training and developing new skills is emerging as an ongoing responsibility in most careers, not just an occasional supplement, as the level of skill needed for meaningful employment soars ever higher.
1. Persons with disabilities are rapidly overcoming their handicaps through the intelligent technology of 2019.
1. Students with reading disabilities routinely ameliorate their disability using print-to-speech reading systems.
1. Print-to-speech reading machines for the blind are now very small, inexpensive, palm-sized devices that can read books (those that still exist in paper form) and other printed documents, and other real-world text such as signs and displays.
1. These reading systems are equally adept at reading the trillions of electronic documents that are instantly available from the ubiquitous wireless worldwide network.
1. After decades of ineffective attempts, useful navigation devices have been introduced that can assist blind people in avoiding physical obstacles in their path, and finding their way around, using global positioning system (“GPS”) technology.
1. A blind person can interact with her personal reading-navigation systems through voice communication, kind of like a Seeing Eye dog that reads and talks.
1. Deaf persons — or anyone with a hearing impairment — commonly use portable speech-to-text listening machines, which display a real-time transcription of what people are saying. The deaf user has the choice of either reading the transcribed speech as displayed text, or watching an animated person gesturing in sign language. These have eliminated the primary communication handicap associated with deafness.
1. Listening machines can also translate what is being said into another language in real time, so they are commonly used by hearing people as well.
1. Computer-controlled orthotic devices have been introduced. These “walking machines” enable paraplegic persons to walk and climb stairs. The prosthetic devices are not yet usable by all paraplegic persons, as many physically disabled persons have dysfunctional joints from years of disuse. However, the advent of orthotic walking systems is providing more motivation to have these joints replaced.
1. There is a growing perception that the primary disabilities of blindness, deafness, and physical impairment do not necessarily impart handicaps. Disabled persons routinely describe their disabilities as mere inconveniences. Intelligent technology has become the great leveler.
1. Translating telephone technology (where you speak in English and your Japanese friend hears you in Japanese, and vice versa) is commonly used for many language pairs. It is a routine capability of an individual’s personal computer.
1. …which also serves as her phone.
1. “Telephone” communication is primarily wireless.
1. …and routinely includes high-resolution moving images.
1. Meetings of all kinds and sizes routinely take place among geographically separated participants.
1. There is effective convergence, at least on the hardware and supporting software level, of all media, which exist as digital objects (i.e., files).
1. …distributed by the ever-present, high-bandwidth, wireless information web.
1. Users can instantly download books, magazines, newspapers, television, radio, movies, and other forms of software to their highly portable personal communication devices.
1. Virtually all communication is digital and encrypted…
1. …with keys available to government authorities.
1. Many individuals and groups, including but not limited to criminal organizations, use an additional layer of virtually unbreakable encryption codes with no third party keys.
1. Haptic technologies are emerging that allow people to touch and feel objects and other persons at a distance.
1. These force feedback devices are widely used in games and in training simulation systems.
1. Interactive games routinely include all-encompassing visual and auditory environments…
1. …but a satisfactory, all-encompassing tactile environment is not yet available.
1. The online chat rooms of the late 1990s have been replaced with virtual environments where you can meet people with full visual realism.
1. People have sexual experiences at a distance with other persons as well as virtual partners.
1. But the lack of the “surround” tactile environment has thus far kept virtual sex out of the mainstream.
1. Virtual partners are popular as forms of sexual entertainment, but they are more game-like than real.
1. And phone sex is a lot more popular now that phones routinely include high resolution real-time moving images of the person on the other end.
1. Despite occasional corrections, the ten years leading up to 2019 have seen continuous economic expansion and prosperity due to the dominance of the knowledge content of products and services.
1. The greatest gains continue to be in the value of the stock market
1. Price deflation concerned economists in the early ’00 years, but they quickly realized it was a good thing. The high tech community pointed out that significant deflation had existed in the computer hardware and software industries for many years earlier without detriment.
1. The United States continues to be the economic leader due to its primacy in popular culture and its entrepreneurial environment.
1. Since information markets are largely world markets, the U.S. has benefited greatly from its immigrant history. Being comprised of all the world’s peoples — specifically, the descendants of peoples from around the globe who had endured great risk for a better life — it has the ideal heritage for the new knowledge-based economy.
1. China has also emerged as a powerful economic player.
1. Europe has been somewhat quicker than Japan and Korea in adopting the American emphasis on venture capital, employee stock options, and tax policies that encourage entrepreneurship, although these practices have become popular throughout the world.
1. At least half of all transactions are conducted on-line.
1. Intelligent assistants which combine continuous speech recognition, natural language understanding, problem solving, and animated personalities routinely assist with finding information, answering questions and conducting transactions. Intelligent assistants have become a primary interface for interacting with information-based services, with a wide range of choices available. A recent poll shows that both male and female users prefer female personalities for their computer-based intelligent assistants. The two most popular are Maggie, who claims to be a waitress in a Harvard Square café, and Michelle, a stripper from New Orleans. Personality designers are in demand, and the field constitutes a growth area in software development.
1. Most purchases of books, musical “albums,” videos, games and other forms of software do not involve any physical object, so new business models for distributing these forms of information have emerged.
1. One shops for these information objects by “strolling” through virtual malls, sampling and selecting objects of interest, rapidly (and securely) conducting an on-line transaction, and then quickly downloading the information using high-speed wireless  communication.
1. There are many types and gradations of transactions to gain access to these products. You can “buy” a book, musical album, video, etc. which gives you unlimited permanent access.
1. Alternatively, you can rent access to read, view, or listen once, or a few times. Or you can rent access by the minute.
1. Access may be limited to one person or to a group of persons (for example, a family or a company). Alternatively, access may be limited to a particular computer, or to any computer accessed by a particular person or by a set of persons.
1. There is a strong trend towards the geographic separation of work groups. People are successfully working together despite living and working in different places.
1. The average household has more than a hundred computers, most of which are embedded in appliances and built-in communication systems.
1. Household robots have emerged, but are not yet fully accepted.
1. Intelligent roads are in use, primarily for long-distance travel. Once your car’s computer guidance system locks onto the control sensors on one of these highways, you can sit back and relax. Local roads, though, are still predominantly conventional. [Hilariously, Kurzweil himself says this isn't just wrong but ""ten years off"". Let's wait and see what 2029 will bring us!]
1. A company west of the Mississippi and north of the Mason-Dixon Line has surpassed a trillion dollars in market capitalization.
1. Privacy has emerged as a primary political issue. The virtually constant use of electronic communication technologies is leaving a highly detailed trail of every person’s every move.
1. Litigation, of which there has been a great deal, has placed some constraints on the widespread distribution of personal data.
1. Government agencies, however, continue to have the right to gain access to people’s files…
1. …which has resulted in the popularity of unbreakable encryption technologies.
1. There is a growing neo-Luddite movement, as the skill ladder continues to accelerate upwards.
1. As with earlier Luddite movements, its influence is limited by the level of prosperity made possible by new technology.
1. The movement does succeed in establishing continuing education as a primary right associated with employment.
1. There is continuing concern with an underclass that the skill ladder has left far behind. The size of the underclass appears to be stable, however.
1. Although not politically popular, the underclass is politically neutralized through public assistance and the generally high level of affluence.
1. The high quality of computer screens, and the facilities of computer-assisted visual rendering software, have made the computer screen a medium of choice for visual art.
1. Most visual art is the result of collaboration between human artists and their intelligent art software.
1. Virtual paintings — high-resolution, wall-hung displays — have become popular. Rather than always displaying the same work of art, as with a conventional painting or poster, these virtual paintings can change the displayed work at the user’s verbal command, or can cycle through collections of art. The displayed artwork can be works by human artists or original art created in real time by cybernetic art software.
1. Human musicians routinely jam with cybernetic musicians.
1. The creation of music has become available to persons who are not musicians.
1. Creating music does not necessarily require the fine motor coordination of using traditional controllers.
1. Cybernetic music creation systems allow people who appreciate music but who are not knowledgeable about music theory and practice to create music in collaboration with their automatic composition software.
1. Interactive brain-generated music, which creates a resonance between the user’s brainwaves and the music being listened to, is another popular genre.
1. Musicians commonly use electronic controllers which emulate the playing style of the old acoustic instruments (e.g., piano, guitar, violin, drums).
1. …but there is a surge of interest in the new “air” controllers in which you create music by moving your hands, feet, mouth and other body parts.
1. Other music controllers involve interacting with specially designed devices.
1. Writers use voice-activated word processing…
1. Grammar checkers are now actually useful.
1. Distribution of written documents from articles to books typically does not involve paper and ink.
1. Style improvement and automatic editing software is widely used to improve the quality of writing.
1. Language translation software is also widely used to translate written works in a variety of languages.
1. Nonetheless, the core process of creating written language is less affected by intelligent software technologies than the visual and musical arts. However, “cybernetic” authors are emerging.
1. Beyond music recordings, images, and movie videos, the most popular type of digital entertainment object is virtual experience software. These interactive virtual environments allow you to go whitewater rafting on virtual rivers, to hang glide in a virtual Grand Canyon, or to engage in intimate encounters with your favorite movie star.
1. Users also experience fantasy environments with no counterpart in the physical world.
1. The visual and auditory experience of virtual reality is compelling, but tactile interaction is still limited.
1. The security of computation and communication is the primary focus of the U.S. Department of Defense. There is general recognition that the side that can maintain the integrity of its computational resources will dominate the battlefield.
1. Humans are generally far removed from the scene of battle.
1. Warfare is dominated by unmanned intelligent airborne devices.
1. Many of these flying weapons are the size of small birds, or smaller.
1. The U.S. continues to be the world’s dominant military power, which is largely accepted by the rest of the world, as most countries concentrate on economic competition.
1. Military conflicts between nations are rare, and most conflicts are between nations and smaller bands of terrorists.
1. The greatest threat to national security comes from bioengineered weapons.
1. Bioengineered treatments have reduced the toll from cancer, heart disease, and a variety of other health problems.
1. Significant progress is being made in understanding the information processing basis of disease.
1. Telemedicine is widely used. Physicians can examine patients using visual, auditory and haptic examination from a distance. Health clinics with relatively inexpensive equipment and a single technician bring health care to remote areas where doctors had previously been scarce.
1. Computer-based pattern recognition is routinely used to interpret imaging data and other diagnostic procedures.
1. The use of noninvasive imaging technologies has substantially increased.
1. Diagnosis almost always involves collaboration between a human physician and a pattern recognition-based expert system.
1. Doctors routinely consult knowledge-based systems (generally through two-way voice communication augmented by visual displays), which provide automated guidance, access to the most recent medical research, and practice guidelines.
1. Lifetime patient records are maintained in computer databases.
1. Privacy issues concerning access to these records (as with many other data bases of personal information) have emerged as a major issue.
1. Doctors routinely train in virtual reality environments, which include a haptic interface. These systems simulate the visual,  auditory and tactile experience of medical procedures, including surgery.
1. Simulated patients are available for continuing medical education, for medical students, and for people who just want to play doctor.
1. There is renewed interest in the Turing test, first proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 as a means for testing intelligence in a machine. Recall that the Turing test contemplates a situation in which a human judge interviews the computer and a human “foil,” communicating with both over terminal lines. If the human judge is unable to tell which interviewee is human and which is machine, the machine is deemed to possess human-level intelligence.
1. Although computers still fail the test, confidence is increasing that they will be in a position to pass it within another one or two decades.
1. There is serious speculation on the potential sentience (i.e., consciousness) of computer-based intelligence.
1. The increasingly apparent intelligence of computers has spurred an interest in philosophy.
1. Computers arriving at the beginning of the next decade will become essentially invisible: woven into our clothing, embedded in our furniture and environment.
1. [Computers] will tap into the worldwide mesh (aka the ""Cloud"", what the World Wide Web will become once all of its linked devices become communicating Web servers, thereby forming vast supercomputers and memory banks) of high-speed communications and computational resources.
1. We’ll have very high-bandwidth wireless communication to the Internet at all times.
1. Displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas.
1. Similar tiny devices will project auditory environments.
1. These resources will provide high-resolution, full-immersion, visual-auditory virtual reality at any time.
1. We will also have augmented reality with displays overlaying the real world to provide real-time guidance and explanations.
1. We’ll have real-time translation of foreign languages, essentially subtitles on the world.
1. We’ll have access to many forms of online information in our daily activities.
1. Virtual personalities that overlay the real world will help us with information retrieval and our chores and transactions. These virtual assistants won’t always wait for questions and directives but will step forward if they see us struggling to find a piece of information.”"|Yuli-Ban|False|https://redd.it/eizjpg|27|0.81|0|16|1|futurology

eitilz|2020-01-02 04:49:14|The implications of extremely low cost power|"Solar Power is no longer science fiction. It's here and it's cheaper than fossil fuels. The Los Angeles DWP recently [inked a deal](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/los-angeles-solicits-record-solar-storage-deal-at-199713-cents-kwh/558018/) for solar power at 2 cents per kwh, plus storage for 1.3 cent per kwh that will allow the city to run on the sun from 7 AM to 11 PM. And there is no sign that progress is slowing. Solar panels are currently only 20% efficient, [new technology](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/green-tech/a28506867/carbon-nanotubes-solar-efficiency/) could allow us to raise that to 80%. The production of polysilicon panels is a difficult and expensive process, a material known as [perovskite](https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/power-from-commercial-perovskite-solar-cells-is-coming-soon) could allow us to produce panels from inkjet printers.

And it's long been suggested that we put solar panels in space and then beam the energy down to earth. The panels would almost always be in the path of the sun and receive more intense sunlight, allowing them to generate in total about 7 times more power than their counterparts on earth.

All of this suggests we are headed to a world where electricity will be extremely cheap.

So what can we do with power for less than 1 cent per kwh?

Well, all the world's water problems would be solved. Any source of water could be made potable whether it's from the sea or wastewater. Instead of having water piped to our homes, we might have home reverse osmosis units that will purify the water that goes down our drains. We might turn the world's deserts green.

Cheap power will be a revolution for chemistry. For example, carbon fiber is a wonder material that is several times stronger than steel for a given weight, but producing it is expensive mostly because of the energy costs. That would no longer be an issue, giving us lightweight cars, airplanes, and buildings. We would no longer need farms, due to our ability to take carbon dioxide and water and produce carbohydrates.

We might not even need to mine anything. We could cheaply melt down all our garbage for raw materials. And if we do need to mine it, we could extract it from the endless sources of materials found in our oceans, such as the [$700 trillion worth of gold](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/09/15/771-trillion-worth-gold-hidden-ocean/#2b3beead23d3) alone.

All of this comes from the fact that breaking apart and putting together molecules is energy intensive and so if energy is cheap, we can do a lot more of it.

We like to dig holes in the ground for railroads, highways, utility lines, storage tanks, and other things. Excavation is a slow and very expensive process. So why not just melt it? [The idea was proposed in the 70s](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/americas-mad-scientists-wanted-use-nuclear-power-create-tunnels-shocking-way-40072), that time using nuclear power. The boring machines would be cheaper and less maintenance heavy with fewer moving parts, they would leave behind glassy tunnel walls, and they could be any shape, not just circular.

We might even be able to achieve the long sought goal of digging to the earth's mantle, which could provide great knowledge about plate tectonics (earthquake prediction anyone?) and about how our planet was formed.

So, this age of cheap power that's ahead of us promises us Jules Verne-like wonders and it's pretty exciting."|kernals12|False|https://redd.it/eitilz|37|0.88|0|51|1|futurology

**io ports:** wires will only be used as a power connection.

**Gaming PCs/Consoles:** Mobile games are about 5-10 years behind the big boxes, depending on your budget.  Even then, game streaming is becoming a more viable option. It takes as long as a console cycle to build a AAA title these days. The missing link is controlling the game locally, to avoid latency, but rendering the resource heavy graphics remotely. Dumping the free to play scams in favor of selling an honest product at an honest price, would be helpful too.

**Cable TV:** The channels will exist as a streaming platform that you subscribe to. The cable companies are still going to provide internet. But nobody's ever going to apply for a broadcasting license ever again. The FCC won't be able to issue fines for obscenity anymore.

**telemarketers:** You'll be harassed by deepfake algos, like [google duplex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VN56jQMWM), instead of telemarketers. So we'll be worse off. Instead of getting an email from a nigerian prince, we'll be getting a call from one.

**pilots:** drones have made fighter pilots completely irrelevant to the theater of war. I think commercial airline pilots will be present for the sake of maintaining the illusion but irrelevant to the flight, unless the hardware malfunctions.

ei6fa4|2019-12-31 18:06:29|Old Wikipedia predictions for the 2010s|"As more and more discussions about what the 2020s will be like appear on futurology I thought I would take a look at Wikipedia editors' predictions about the 2010s. Here is the [Wikipedia-article from December 31, 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2010s&oldid=335181242). Let's see how accurate some of those predictions had been:

>World population is likely to reach around 7.5 billion by the end of the decade

According to Wikipedia the current world population is approximately 7.7 billion people.

>IPv6 has to be deployed around the world, as the unallocated IPv4 address pool is projected to be exhausted by 2011.

According to Wikipedia IPv6 still hasn't been deployed everywhere and the IPv4 address pool still hasn't been completely exhausted due to various ""tricks"" (like reallocation of unused addresses, NAT, etc.)

>NASA will launch the James Webb Space Telescope as early as 2013.

That didn't happen. According to Wikipedia the launch is currently scheduled for March 2021.

>The Orion is set to replace the Space Shuttle around 2014 or 2015.

According to Wikipedia that didn't happen due to the cancellation of the Constellations program. However work on the spacecraft is still in progress.

>Both the International Linear Collider and ITER may be completed during the latter half of the decade.

Unfortunately ITER hasn't been completed yet. And work on the ILC is still in progress.

>The Gotthard Base Tunnel, then the world's longest railway tunnel, will be completed in 2017 or 2018.

Indeed this tunnel is being used now.

>Supercomputers are projected to reach exaflop scale in 2019.

This prediction is vague. If one combines the computational power of all TOP500 supercomputers the prediction is indeed true. But no single supercomputer is currently capable of such speed.

>With the Altair spacecraft, NASA plans another series of manned landings on the moon beginning in 2019.

The Constellations program was cancelled. Thus the Altair spacecraft has never been built. So far humanity hasn't returned to the moon.

&#x200B;

After looking at these predictions I noticed that predictions about artificial intelligence hadn't been made at all. And even the [current version of the 2010s-article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010s) only briefly mentions AI in one sentence:

>Some researchers contend that a deep learning ""revolution"" occurred around 2012, transforming the artificial intelligence industry; it bolstered speech recognition and computer vision development and allowed for the fruition of technologies such as Deepfakes."|understanding0|False|https://redd.it/ei6fa4|19|0.91|0|2|1|futurology

Another society regulating dopamine juicer inspired by porn and its influence on media,medicine and science|"Firstly, focus! What are the most joy-inducing(hormone stimulating) things a human being can do? It’s reproduction, removal of feces and wastes from our body, gratification achievement, breathing, energy resources fulfillment(eat&drink). For every area of these commercial stimulators exist, for example: 
Reproduction - p0rn, escort.. 
Breathing - smoking..
Gratification - Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and other social media in lesser extent..
Energy resources - all kinds of stimulators, alcohol, drugs, junk food&drink, caffeine..

So, this pooping/pissing/metabolism niche is free for now. New chemical formulas capable of influence on these processes may be discovered one day!!  Advertised “healthy”(just as masturbation and porn nowadays) on media, dominating the researches(paying/bribing scientists), this wonderful metabolism booster may capture the market. Following the steps of added sugar, alcohol, smoking and p0rn, it is known and easy to persuade people that good effects overweight the bad ones. It would even be more attractive if introduced as healthy  food additive, similar to sugar. The effects would alter the biorhythms and all natural body rhythms unlike caffeine. Sure they would be negative effects too, but bribing and promoting in modern capitalistic society is not an obstacle. 

Tl;DR  Metabolism enhancer additive/pill/substance would create massive profit by creating another “hidden” addiction that society has to discover itself.

However, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria and Sudan are already being assessed for their readiness to embark on a nuclear energy program. And Algeria, Tunisia, Uganda and Zambia are also considering the power source.

Sector experts said that, without significantly increasing the use of nuclear power, it will be difficult for African countries to produce adequate electricity for industries and reduce carbon emissions.

Africa has nearly 20% of the world’s uranium resources. About thirty countries on the continent have reserves of Uranium and some, such as Niger, with currently less than 10% of world production or to a lesser extent South Africa and Namibia, are on the list of the most important deposits World. Reserves have been recently updated in other countries in southern and eastern Africa and evidence of nuclear prospects in Africa, a dozen countries have recently expressed their intentions to develop this raw material to satisfy their growing electricity needs, particularly through the civilian nuclear industry, which is increasingly less expensive and above all less polluting.

[Three Chinese state-backed firms](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/1933488/chinas-nuclear-plant-makers-seek-new-markets-along-ancient-silk) are actively pursuing opportunities to export their reactor construction expertise, especially in developing nations that do not have their own construction capabilities.

“The export of nuclear reactors will become one of the key pillars for executing China’s one belt, one road strategy,” Zheshang Securities analyst Zheng Dandan said.

Beijing-based projects developer China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC) chairman Sun Qin was quoted by state media China News Service last month as saying that 80 per cent of the up to 300 new reactors projected to be built by 2030 globally could be in ‘one belt, one road’ nations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin recently spoke at a Russia-Africa summit in Sochi, Russia, in late October—attended by heads of state and government representatives from 55 countries—and said his government is also ready to provide its nuclear power technology to more of Africa.

“Rosatom [the Russian nuclear company] is prepared to help our African partners in creating a nuclear industry,” Putin said, with “the construction of research centers based on multifunctional reactors.” Rosatom already is building a $29 billion nuclear plant for Egypt, and the company is also helping Nigeria, Uganda, the Republic of Congo, and Rwanda establish nuclear facilities. The El Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant in Egypt will have four VVER-1200 reactors, or water-water energetic reactors, which are Russian-designed Generation III+ reactors. Russia is financing 85% of the project with a loan of about $25 billion to Egypt, and Egypt is paying the remaining 15% over a period of 13 years. 

Training is currently ongoing in different African countries in preparation for operation of the nuclear plants.

Michael Gatari, associate professor of nuclear sciences applications at the University of Nairobi's Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology, said nuclear energy is the only stable power option that can better serve Africa.

A key is nuclear safety, and reactor accidents may cause a lot of trauma. But Gatari said very few accidents have taken place because of thoroughness during the construction period.

""The radioactive waste disposal is another public concern because people don't understand that the nuclear power generation installation facility is highly protected, well-guarded and ethically driven,"" he said."|Surur|False|https://redd.it/ei4yzm|13|0.75|0|4|1|futurology

I'm optimistic however that great advances in new lightweight high strength materials (think carbon nanotubes and graphene) will give us the ability to enclose entire cities.

The benefits of this would be fantastic. At a constant 70 degree temperature inside, the people would be free, no matter what season or weather outside, to walk, bicycle, and do other ""outdoor"" activities. The cost of snow removal would be eliminated and with some sort of on site power plant, there would never be any outages. 

Where this will come in handy are in the places that are currently so cold that mass human habitation is undesirable, places like Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. Most of the year, people would get to enjoy the beautiful scenery of those places and when the temperature plunges to well below freezing, life can continue inside the dome as normal."|kernals12|False|https://redd.it/eidj96|0|0.4|0|4|1|futurology

But from many perspectives our technology is really shit compared to what the natural world accomplishes accross it's entire product line. For example, if human technology was as sophisticated as the natural world, then all of our products could

* attain all their energy directly or indirectly from the sun
* self replicate
* be self-directed in it's main functions
* be self feeding
* to some extent self repairing
* and be completely 100% recyclable back into the core production system when self-repair is no longer possible, to be used by not only other products like itself, but in fact any of the natural world's products. 

Maybe this isn't the case but it seems to me that humanity in general looks upon mankinds shiny new inventions and thinks they are far more sophisticated than anything in the natural world, when exactly the opposite is true. I can't think of a single human invention that is capable of a single one of the above technological capabilities, and yet I never hear of those capabilities listed above as being a goal for our technologies. 

My question is: is there already a branch of economics or technology that strives to attain these abilities? Is there a name for this type of techonology, or economic system, or society?"|arobint|False|https://redd.it/ehxhiq|3|0.56|0|30|1|futurology

Here's some stuff to make you a little more hopeful for the future and maybe a little more eager to push to make sure the future we get is the fun one.

3 versions -
The one we can start having now, the amazing one 5-50 years away and the crazy one 50+ years away.
If it's simply too long just go down to ""Who wants to be a trillionaire"" to have your mind blown before you move on. Do the second link that is timestamped.

----------------------------------------------------------

##The one we can start having right away (some cities are already doing it)

Hempcrete = Improved air quality in homes, a lower power bill, and more!

Sustainable Urban Development brings too many benefits to list

In broad terms, improved health, more spare time, lower cost of living with a higher quality of life, and that's just to start.

Kite Wind Power Systems

Inexpensive, reliable, and almost here.

It was a factory assembly line that was in the final stages of it's design/construction phase. It was basically a bunch of mechanical arms with hands that could be programmed on the fly to manufacture or assembly completely different things.

First things first - I know this is really long with an overwhelming amount of links. It could have been a lot longer, but I know my audience and did what I could to keep it as concise as possible.

But it's still overwhelming. So just bookmark it and try not to lose it like you do all your other saved-for-later bookmarks.

Also you don't need to memorize this. One solid scan through, pick a few of the sections/items you're most interested in, make a pit-stop at ""What Can I Do?"" on your way out. That's plenty. I'm trying to ""change the discourse"" not give you homework.

#The Silver Bullet Solution ""my"" roadmap

""My"" Roadmap is essentially the easiest of the top solutions from other plans. It's the stuff I think we have a real chance of pulling off sooner than later. They are also solutions that the average joe can be apart of.



My favorite solutions are the ones with economic benefits, the more obvious and immediate the benefit the better. They are easy to pitch. You like money? Oh wow that's so crazy I like money too. weshouldhangoutidiocracy.gif


The idea is not to redistribute the wealth, however. It's to create new wealth (and decrease pressure) primarily targetted at the bottom 20-50% of the population. These are consumers, these are not wealth hoarders. They will spend the vast majority of whatever new wealth comes there way, which grows the economy. Hopefully that in turn gives room for more public spending where we want it. Hey, I said hopefully.

##Regenerative Agriculture
Video - Regenerative Agriculture -- a solution to climate change

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp1i8_JFsao

This is 9:45 of pure gold. Watch it. 


The largest takeaway is that Agriculture has MASSIVE potential for reversing Climate Change and those methods have side effect bonuses such as water retention in the soil, just for a start.


https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/e86ugj/in_areas_with_low_literacy_rates_showing_videos/

The top comments in this reddit post point out that using/spreading videos demonstrating agricultural techniques may be effective for more than just areas with low literacy rates.


Think about it from the Farmer's perspective. They spend every hour of every day working on their fields, equipment, and business. They have NO time to sit down and research improvements and new ideas.

They aren't searching Youtube or watching TED Talks, the government as per usual is slow to take their roll in spreading information (I mean you'd think food security would fall under the governments roll...)

##Food. There are 3 components I like to keep in mind for myself.

##Beef is bad.
You should know removing beef from your diet could reduce your own footprint by as much as 80% of someone going vegetarian. Beef is super, super bad for the environment.

##Meat Reduction Diet
Even just reducing your meat consumption by 20% (and hopefully convincing others to do the same) is a big start.
I actually like this one because people often don't realize they are very well eating too much meat as it is. So they reduce by 20% and they start to feel better and their brain goes ""well, shit if I feel better maybe I should try to reduce even more?"".

You're basically just letting them find out for themselves.

Afterall asking someone for 50% sounds like a lot but 10-20% isn't so bad.
For example: I aimed for 20% meat reduction and I landed at AT LEAST 50% while also eliminating beef entirely.

##Meat ""alternatives""
Although Artificial Meat has advanced surprisingly quickly it's still a bit away.
If you were one of the people who tried a Beyond Meat burger when they came out, didn't like it and haven't tried another.... go try another. I swear they must have tweaked the recipe. First one I tried I couldn't finish, it was pretty bad. I tried it again about a month ago got one at an A&W and ended up having a make out session with the burger in my car in the parking lot. Sure hope THAT wasn't recorded by someone with their phone out...

My point is that if you only gave the meatless meat options a try once before, try it again.

##JUST. DO. IT.

#Top Goals:
Push for Sustainable Urban Development locally wherever you are
Change the Discourse essentially from ""give up everything"" to ""we can actually have it even better if we do it right""

For a long time I've been a lurker. I've read many times people say they would do more, but they don't know what more is. 
They bike to work, try to eat less meat, try to keep their power usage down, what more can even be done?
So here's some information on what you can do to be a real part of the solution.

This is already too long so I am going to try to keep a lid on the motivational speeches but I just have to say:
I don't really get how people can give up.

It's just that I do risk vs. reward scenario's a lot I guess and it's like this:
On the Rewards side we have:
So many benefits this would be a wall of text just to list them all.
On the Risks side we have:
Nothing. As far as I can tell there are no risks to trying.

##Alright let's talk action.

Politicians need to be flooded with normal toned, well considered, concise emails.
Literally all they get is the absolute extremes on both end, giving them a messed up view of their constituents. Normal people don't email their representatives. This is both a good and a bad thing. The bad news is we need to change that. The good news is, is that since so few people do it your messages actually carry considerable weight and it doesn't take everyone to be doing this.

https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change

While changing our habits is definitely a good thing it's going to take a lot more than just that.
This is the kind of thing I am thinking of when I talk about MEANINGFUL Individual Actions and REAL solutions. Telling people to they can just stop driving their cars isn't a bad idea at all, I can't wait to ditch mine. But without public transportation, walkable urban environments and sustainable urban infrastructure and designing all that ""ditch the car"" stuff is kinda BS.

------------------------------------------------

#Project Mobilization's Mobilizations :


##Round One


""Zurawski takes some comfort in what he see's as an increased will to act on climate change. Zurawski and Rik Logenberg, a municipal councillor from Nelson, B.C., talked extensively about climate change and then reached out to elected officials across the country. Now, 300 municipal officials meet every two weeks to discuss online what their municipalities are doing and not doing and what they can learn from each other.""

That is a quote taken from my local newspaper.

Simply put, if we can get some like Sustainable Urban Development principles brought to one city, it can proliferate very quickly.

So after coordinating with r/Urbanplanning and r/SocialEngineering I will coordinate with others in r/HLFX to see what we can do to bring these ideas to Halifax, Nova Scotia.


Begin Changing Public Discourse

We don't need to give our lifestyles up we can actually have it better if we do it.

This little Reddit campaign is my first shot at it.


I am not sure WHAT I am going to work on with u/ILikeNeurons but I'm hoping there's something. Maybe we can find some people to be his/her apprentices so they can help out with all that weight they've been carrying!

eh56r3|2019-12-29 11:59:03|Do you believe Musk will successfully reach his goals regarding space exploration?|"To be completely honest I don't believe so... Only if he has some sort of Mega government investment and probably most importantly if he doesn't ""spin-off""'s SpaceX initial and principal philosophy. He is a extremely dedicated and passionated person in respect of space but a bit inconsistent (I say this mostly because of the Tesla Pick-up which is completely against Tesla's philosophy).
What do you think?

On the other side he already inspired a LOT of people and resurrected the love for space exploration which for me might be one of his biggest life accomplishments.
