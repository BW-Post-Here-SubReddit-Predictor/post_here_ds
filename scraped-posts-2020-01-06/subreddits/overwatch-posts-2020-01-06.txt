ejs47j|2020-01-04 05:06:29|Weekly Role Discussion Thread: Support - January 04, 2020|"In this weekly thread you can discuss the **Support** roles of Overwatch to your heart's delight. What are the characteristics of those heroes?

>The objective of support is to heal, buff and provide utility. Support heroes boost the overall performance of their team by increasing their survivability, speed, and damage output. They are generally the worst duelists and are best when surrounded by teammates.

— [Overwatch Wikia](http://overwatch.wikia.com/wiki/Role)

You can find a list of the current supportive heroes on the [Overwatch Hero Overview](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/#support).

Share guides and strategies that are valuable to a Support Overwatch Hero or other tips and tricks that helped you to get better. You can also propose ideas why a certain hero is bad in your eyes and how to make it better. Please do so in a constructive way!"|AutoModerator|False|https://redd.it/ejs47j|25|0.83|0|132|1|overwatch

B is average.  C is niche.  D and F are bad.  Double shield is still meta.  Orisa/Sigma, sometimes Rein.   Since the shields were nerfed, shieldbreak is more viable (which is why Zenyatta/Baptiste is an optimal support combo).

el0z4h|2020-01-06 21:50:55|Seriously, what the hell is wrong with compete placement?|So, season 20 has started and I've tried one more time to place in tanks. Season 19 was a bit strange for me: I got silver both in heals and dps, but bronze in tanks for some reason. Obviously, it's hard to up a rank in compete, especially if you don't play everyday. But in bronze it's like a freaking lottery, you either smash your opponents or get the team that gets the smashing. And back to now. I go through the placements. 5 games, 5 wins. I won't say that I was the sole reason of our victories, it's not true. But I did help. Got two POTG (when I pushed two guys with Orisa's attractor into the river in Rialto was especially  pleasing) and plenty of gold medals. And what have I got? Some f\*\*king 1464 SR and bronze. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT'S THE POINT? Just leave my points from the previous seasons if placements are so useless|adc34|False|https://redd.it/el0z4h|6|0.87|0|6|1|overwatch

The shield nerf patch was significant, but I don't think it did enough to shake up the meta and now I just feel the game is getting dull fast. 

I get that Overwatch 2 is early in development, and I've always been a proponent of Blizzard's ""commitment to quality"" mentality to ensure their signature polish, but even a season estimate of its release would go a long way. ex. Summer 2021. 

Don't get me wrong, Role Queue and While You Wait were two of the best additions to the game it's ever had, but I don't think they're going to be enough keep people engaged for months on end until the next piece of content. 

*Something* to look forward to would also be nice, even if that's just a hero/map teaser. It's been about 5 months since the last hero release and 8 for the last map. 

Let's face it, the seasonal events are boring. Is anyone really looking forward to the Lunar New Year event *again*? The archives event was one of the things I looked forward to the most throughout the year, and now that's cancelled in preparation for OW2. 

With the scheduled hero and map releases of years previous, staying engaged with it was easy. Now Blizzard is just going dark until they have news about OW2? Are we really just on autopilot mode until then?"|MethixYo|False|https://redd.it/ekfz45|105|0.85|0|37|1|overwatch

But he did it as a group and, as a result, 5 other people( me included) got 30 min ban for Comp and lost 50 SR. 

This is ridiculous. Group leader shouldn't be able to leave from a competitive match with the whole group. Now, instead of losing 20 SR and starting another fun game of OW, I write the post with slight hope, that some people will see it, that issue will get some attention and it will be fixed in future."|art_master_99|False|https://redd.it/ekc36y|101|0.93|0|8|1|overwatch

eky2ig|2020-01-06 18:30:06|I need your guys help on a argument i have with my friend|"My friend and I keep debating as to who is the better player. I know it may seem petty, but when I queue with his friends, they always say how bad I am at the game. 

For some context, I have two accounts that I play on. My first account was made the year the game came out. Overwatch was my first shooter game, so I was not the best. I did not take the game seriously at all,  but I still had a blast playing. We would play everyday and we eventually hit level 25 and went straight into comp. After finishing our placements, my friend got placed in plat (around 2500) and I hit gold (around 2300). Because he hit platinum before me, he still insists to this day that he is the better player. He did all his placements with his friends who are high silver and low gold. He is now in gold ranging around low 2200 from when I last checked. I have yet to finish my placements on that account so I am not sure what my rank will be. 

My second account, is a new smurf account that I made fairly recently. I made this account because I felt like I have improved much more from the first year I have played. This is my account that I have played with none of my friends, and is my account that I never queued with anyone. I made this account so I could have a feel as to what my real rank as a player is. I hit diamond, which has been a goal for me ever since I started playing the game. I play comp every day, and I maintain my rank as a diamond player. The highest I have hit was 3200

TL;DR -My friend stills thinks he is better than me because he hit platnium before me, which was over 2 years ago. He is now low gold, and I am diamond. Is his reasoning correct? I could be wrong so feel free to roast me in the comments. Thanks!"|CnstrnCone|False|https://redd.it/eky2ig|0|0.33|0|7|1|overwatch

ekp8br|2020-01-06 05:06:30|Matchmaking definitely takes level into account *theory*|"So, this is something I've surmised for quite some time, but now am fully believing to be true. That who you get matched with is not only your SR range but takes your level into account as well. Part of this evidence is anecdotal, by looking at games from my gold border account (and how often I get gold borders in those games) with 3 other accounts I own as well (That are newer, and get paired with other lower level accounts). The same observations are true of many friends that I play with since we're all veterans.

But the real kicker that has me thinking it now, is that two accounts are at the same SR (2850-2950) but one account is level 2000 the other is level 800. My level 800 account has a queue time of <5 minutes, the level 2000 account has a queue time of >10 minutes.

How. How do two accounts (I logged back in and out within 30 seconds to check twice) at the same SR have such a vastly different time estimate, if for no other reason than the level difference. 

My hunch is the level 2000 account is taking longer because there's less high level accounts to pair it with, despite the fact that my other account with the same SR has a <5 wait time."|Willster328|False|https://redd.it/ekp8br|2|1.0|0|12|1|overwatch

ekiksj|2020-01-05 20:28:15|Arcade Mode idea: 6v6 Mirror Match|"The basic concept of this mode is each map would have 6 characters (2 of each role) locked before the game starts. These could be pre-determined per map, or completely random for each game. Seeing as it’s an Arcade mode, random would probably be more interesting. It’d be like Mystery Heroes but each team has the same comp.

For instance, let’s say the map is Volskaya Industries. As the character select screen pops up, you see that the randomized comp is D.Va, Ball, McCree, Reaper, Zenyatta and Mercy. There may not be much synergy but since both teams are stuck with the same comp it becomes a battle to see who can perform best within the limitations.

I like this idea because it takes players out of their comfort zone and brings in characters who don’t get a lot of love depending on the current meta. Thoughts?"|PhoustPhoustPhoust|False|https://redd.it/ekiksj|7|0.79|0|4|1|overwatch

ektztd|2020-01-06 13:13:54|Newer Boring maps are surviving, interesting/challenging maps are being removed?|"Removed -

Illios - I'm going to assume It was probably due to all of the times you could get knocked off the map, and I could understand why this would annoy people - But the same could be said of lijang tower, and that still exists!! Lijang tower you've constantly got teams of Wrecking ball and lucio etc charging forward trying to get boops! 

For me, Illios at least had somewhat of an interesting design, and I think the panic of the well and the point near the edge actually added to the excitement, it was something to think about, and this is probably why it was hated -  The complexity and anxiety it added, but that was part of the fun for me.

Now what do we have to replace Illios? Busan! - Compared to Illios it's ""safer"" in the sense that there's less environmental concern, but the map is just completely boring and bland. 

Numbani? I literally have no idea how people can be for getting rid of Numbani, but for keeping the likes of Havana? Numbani had character to it and again had interesting use of tiers of cover, each point could be incredibly challenging to attack or defend. A much more interesting an versatile map than the newer maps that have survived. It is much better than Havana!!! Which is bland and boring.

Horizon Lunar colony - Not my favourite map - But at least it adds something new with the way it is designed - low gravity battles, and if people think this shouldn't be in competitive, we can easily have the same map but remove the low gravity aspect to that part of the map.

HLC had character to it's design, it had an ambience to it. It was enjoyable to play and challenging in it's own way, and it wasn't poorly designed. Sure, the low gravity corridor was questionable I suppose, but not enough to remove it in favour of the more bland newer maps.

What do we have now? Busan, Havana and Paris - Boring, bland and easily forgettable maps!!!!

Does anyone on this forum really love any of these new maps?

Why do people seem to favour maps that are less challenging? Ones that re boring and bland? Can someone explain their love for Paris/Havana or busan? I fail to see their appeal over the removed maps which are far more challenging to play!"|b3lial666|False|https://redd.it/ektztd|0|0.36|0|6|1|overwatch

ekj8ww|2020-01-05 21:20:03|Will my competitive games eventually even out for me? (Massive loss streaks)|For context, I’ve been playing Overwatch since early 2017 and the only seasons I played competitive on were seasons 4 and 7. I decided since season 20 started recently that I would get into the competitive scene and give it a go. Placement matches for tank and support turned out ok and I got placed in high silver (right on the edge of becoming gold). I grinded my support up to around 2100 SR and was happy that I settled into a gold support placement and was having fun. Up until yesterday. I was ready to have fun in competitive but for the life of me no matter how much I healed people and tried to help out the team I just couldnt get a win. I lost 8 matches in a row and didnt win one game. I now have 7 wins and 18 losses in this competitive season and its a real blower. And for the record I am a solo player so I didnt expect a huge placement such as platinum or diamond, im happy where I am but all of those losses were a huge blower and I am now around 1700 SR now in support because those losses took a HUGE dip on my SR. Just wondering if it gets any better and my SR will eventually level off to give me a 50/50 chance at winning matches. I also would like to think im a decent support as moira and try to heal everyone when they are low and dont try to play a DPS moira like some people do.

ekn0yr|2020-01-06 02:04:16|How does ths ranking system work?|Generally I don't bother too much with competitive play. I play my matches and whatever rank I get is whatever. This time around, I decide to actually try and see where I place. This is where my confusion comes in. When I do my placements, I do support first, thank second, and damage last since it takes so long. Out of the five support matches, I get 3 wins, one loss, and a draw which placed me at 1477 SR (bronze rank). Seems odd to me but whatever. I do Tank next, get 1 less and 4 wins which gives me a 1671 SR. Seems even stranger to me but then the kicker. I do my Damage placements, get 4 wins and only got 1579 SR which has to be a mistake. How does winning all 5 of my games, with 4 of the matches ended with me have 3 gold medals give me less than the Tank where I had roughly the same amount of medals and a loss? Is there something I'm just not seeing or is the competitive ranking off for everyone? I'm not expecting to be diamond tier or anything but I'm just scratching my head trying to figure this out. If the answer is super obvious and I'm just overlooking this, I'll remove the post but I'm kind of irritated that I actually tried this season and got jack for it.|ADWinri|False|https://redd.it/ekn0yr|1|0.6|0|2|1|overwatch

ekl96y|2020-01-05 23:50:10|New and have a question about how competitive works|"Hi I've been playing overwatch a while but never really tried competitive. 

My girlfriend just got the game an we've been playing together, but are both really bad so quick play amd arcade is usually just us dying over and over.

She finally hit level 25 so she could get into competitive, and we thought that at least then it would rank us with other bad players.

So she tried getting ranked for her tank earlier and somehow landed gold tier. We are baffled because we can both agree that's just way too high of a rank lol. And her games are still super frustrating because she is constantly dying the entire time and her teammates are always telling her she sucks. 

Firstly, why would she get ranked so high when she cant contribute to her team at all at that level?

So then I figured we could try a different role and see what happens, but when we group up, it wont let me pick the support role. She is unranked in damage and support. I am unranked in tank and damage. I am bronze 900 in support.

When we group up it wont allow me to pick support no matter what because of our group skill rating range. Even though she is picking support too which she is unranked in.

I dont understand how any of this works, but online it says we should be able to play within a 1000 rank of each other. If I'm rank 900 and she is unranked, why cant we both be support together?"|Electro226|False|https://redd.it/ekl96y|1|0.57|0|4|1|overwatch

I'm not some silver/plat level average player. I've hit GM on every single role and haven't placed below Masters ever (rank 70 in S1). These aren't suspicious snaps that I'm talking about. It's enemy DPS using wallhacks where they randomly scope in on an area I am going to without any reason to suspect I would be heading there and without sonar/widowmaker ult. Most of these cheaters have awful positioning and use ultimates incorrectly but are rocking a 60% scoped crit accuracy. They make it to high masters before their cheats aren't enough to push them to GM, but it still makes the game not enjoyable. 

The main reason I used to play Overwatch is because it was cheater free. I play TPP in PUBG and it's littered with cheaters. Blizzard used to have such a strong anti-cheat for this game.

Whilst I am very greatful for programs like 'Queue Popper' which drops a notification to your phone when you're in a game; I'd love there to be an actual feature on desktop which notifies you once you've found a game. 

The While you Wait feature is awesome, and at least gives us something to do (optionally) whilst in queue, sometimes however - I'll boot up Photoshop and do something in that instead or watch a YouTube video. Currently, I don't believe there's any way for me to know that I've found a game without tabbing back into it (which is something I do actively, but would rather not) - why doesn't Overwatch alert you the same way Siege does for example?

If it was 3-2-1 or 3-1-1+a flex or maybe even 3-2-2 think of how much easier it would be to find a game. More people would get to play the role they want and it could even create  new ways  to play. Not only would this help with wait times it would help with not having lower or higher level players in your game.

In this game, I played soldier, reaper, and pharah. The video is mostly from the perspective of the streamer (CarloCarlone) and I believe he is a mid masters player in 2 roles. He played doomfist in the first round and mei in the second round, while I played soldier, then reaper, then pharah.

ekjvzm|2020-01-05 22:13:35|Role Queue Idea|"I love the new role queue system (proceed with down votes) as I mainly play tank, and it makes my queue times almost non-existent compared to the previous system.  What I don't like however, is that whenever I want to practice DPS I'm stuck with an 8+ minute wait to get into a game where my team gets wrecked an I get a whole 2 minutes of practice.  What I want here is shorter queue times for DPS and here is my solution!

Instead of the ""loot box"" or ""credits"" rewards you get sometimes for queuing as tank/healer, give a ""reduce DPS queue time"" reward that you can spend to hop to the front of the DPS queue line.  Maybe make this an optional reward in case those queuing for tank/heals want their loot box/credits instead.  This would incentive players to play tank/heals more often so that they can get some rewards to save up and use when they want to practice DPS.  I think you only get the rewards when you win anyways, so people shouldn't be queuing as heals/tank just for the reward and then throwing games or afk'ing.   Would be nice to be rewarded for all the hard work players put in being a tank/healer!"|hugcub|False|https://redd.it/ekjvzm|0|0.25|0|61|1|overwatch

ekb902|2020-01-05 10:11:42|Hanzo Discussion|"No, this is not a rant, but a way to initiate debate and discussion to further expand ideas on hero balance.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be honest, I'm a little apprehensive posting something like this on here, but I feel like it needs to be done. On this post, I will be discussing an issue I currently have with Hanzo, and what I see when I watch high level players play. Discussion isn't limited on just Hanzo, either; you could also talk about how Genji needs balancing or whatever needs balancing. **This a base for respectful discussion and debate; not all people have to agree with your opinion.** So please, don't be a dick.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hanzo is great at a lot of things.

Yes, he should have decent mobility like wall climb, but not an ability that allows him to escape death every five seconds. I believe that if someone closes the distance on Hanzo (like Doomfist, Tracer, Winston, etc.), then Hanzo either dies or gives up that ground or gets a skillful flick on their head to kill them. The Doomfist, Tracer, or Winston shouldn't have half their health taken away, while the Hanzo gets away with free ult charge and little to no damage done to him. Maybe he deals half the Winston's health with a fully charged arrow, but he takes a significant amount of damage while escaping? A trade-off, if you will.

If an enemy gets close to Hanzo, then he should suffer the consequences. I'm not saying that Hanzo should die every time a flanker gets close, but what I am saying is he shouldn't be able to avoid them with such incredible ***ease***\*\*.\*\*

Storm arrow is also a really big problem when it comes to something like this.

I believe that, as a sniper, Hanzo should be good at dealing damage at long and medium ranges. Not only is he good at dealing incredible damage at medium to long ranges, but he can deal seventy damage per shot up close with storm arrow and can deal even more than that if he gets a head shot.

I also believe that Hanzo should be limited to his capabilities of one shotting squishies, since he sometimes doesn't even need to use storm arrow to dismantle someone that is close to him. Just an arrow that doesn't even need to be fully charged can easily deal enough damage with a head shot to scare off an enemy flanker.

So Hanzo has insane survivability, has fantastic short, medium, and long range capabilities, and his only weakness is...what? I can't find one. Health, maybe?

So, what do we do about this? Well, here's a list:

1. To allow squishies to not feel as oppressed by Hanzo, we lower his fully charged arrow rate from every 0.75 seconds, to every 1 second. This gives squishies time to react and to adjust against him, but still allows Hanzo to take full advantage of the ability to prep. a fully charged arrow behind a wall, climb up the wall, and shoot the fully charged arrow.
2. We can try not allowing his arrows that are not fully charged to head shot. Fully charged arrows do the same damage on a body shot and a head shot, but arrows that are just barely not full charge don't instantly kill a squishy. This allows for more counter-play options like Tracer and Doomfist that enjoy getting in Hanzo's face but can't quite follow up, because the Hanzo scares them off with a head shot that wasn't fully charged.
3. The arrows storm arrow should be reduced from six, to three or four. The damage should be reduced from seventy to forty or forty-five, and this ability should not be able to head shot. The ability could then have a seven or six second cool down. This sounds harsh, but bear with me. I believe Hanzo's damage should stay the same: 125 body shot fully charged arrow and over 300 upon head shot. But, if he's going to be good at medium to long range, then his short range should be useless. I believe storm arrow should be used as a finisher, like Widow's sub-machine gun. Maybe you've got this Mccree at one health, and you just can't connect that last arrow. Well, storm arrows has your back, but you have to be precise; you don't have that many arrows.
4. Erase lunge all together, or increase cool down to seven seconds to increase counter-play. This nerf would force Hanzo to play more passively and with the team if there are counters on the enemy team. And if one of his counters is in his face, then he can only use lunge once in that 1v1 instead of twice.
5. Remember, it doesn't have to be all of these; it could only require one or two (or all if you'd prefer).

Again, **this is not a rant** but merely ideas that I would like for people to see, consider, discuss, criticize, add to, and debate. The current patch we have is great, but now we need to discuss and debate what we can do in this current state of the game so we can improve the game's balance even further."|DucksonQuack069|False|https://redd.it/ekb902|1|0.53|0|14|1|overwatch

Having to peel for myself even when I'm with my team has become a nightmare. I feel like a helpless pray animal at times. 

As a tank I can absorb way more damage. In the case of snipers if I get hit I usually have enough time to reposition. Also, Hog and Hammond are fat dps' that, if uncontested, can be just as effective as any dps it seems. There are other tanks that have awesome abilities that make self peeling much easier too.

ekaaf3|2020-01-05 08:16:59|Putting smurfs against smurfs would fix the issue|"It's quite obvious and I bet even more obvious to Blizzard internally who is on a smurf account. Let's be real; if you are a sub-level100 account in Masters+, this isn't your first account.

If a system was implemented that forced smurf mirroring - i.e. a smurf would have to be matched against a smurf in the same role in any given competitive game - we'd fix the issue.

1) Smurfs would get longer queue times, discouraging the practice.

2) Smurfs wouldn't get free reign to stomp games, as there would be an opposing smurf in the same role to counteract them.

I used to not care too much about smurfing but it just really, REALLY is a problem. These past few days, *every single match* has been decided by who has more smurfs. 

**It's just not fun.**

Look, I get that people ""having alts"" is supposed to be a legitimate thing and that they ""get placed appropriately"" but we know that's absolutely not true. There is no such thing as placing GM on a new account. Therefore by nature every single GM player who makes an alt is smurfing. They know what they're doing, and even if it's not technically against the rules, it's still wrong in my opinion."|O2M|False|https://redd.it/ekaaf3|0|0.43|0|8|1|overwatch

I find this weird because I used to play competitive Call of Duty and won multiple online tournaments across different Call of Duty titles and I never got anxious playing that.

I'm at 3450 SR right now and I know I can climb higher, but after 3 games or so, my anxiety always gets the best of me and I tell myself to stop while I'm ahead, even though it still sounds really fun.

It's now gotten to the point where we're both considering never going into voice at all because at least then it's only text chat and not people yelling into our ears half the game.

No idea why they would make it like a different day thing, maybe to encourage people to play more, because hey you if you lose... surely you are on for a win soon? But just when you been winning enough suddenly... nobody is in voice chat... you got these one tricks who refuse to switch. At your most pivitol game you get given your worst team, its like you would take **Any** team you have been with previously over these guys for your Rank up or Season high game.

I was listening to a streamer talk about it with his 4300SR account and he was just saying 'Well the other team is stacked, this will be a loss, but the SR for this account is too high so it wants it to go back down'.

When streamers who are GM are predicting their losses from spawn.... well you know this game isn't honest with how it matches teams.

Originally when blizzard was only shipping them from the US, I remember I paid 150 dollars for the Reaper and Tracer statue. After a while, they finally opened the EU shop and the prices where the same in Euro's (which is already more expensive). After some more time, they raised the prices for EU towards 175 EUR.

Today I checked the website again, all the 'normal size' statues are raised to 215 EUR's a piece, Doomfist is 330 EURs now from 300 before, and [D.VA](https://D.VA) is 530 EUR's now, coming from 450 originally..

How can blizzard justify making them more and more expensive? They only have production costs, they should be going down in price..

Furthermore is both the statue of Mei and Lucio not available on the EU store.

ejllq1|2020-01-03 20:55:39|Mystery Heroes Suggestion|"**PREFACE:** This may be more of a niche improvement, but if you are anything like me, you enjoy playing Mystery Heroes. I think it is fun, and it forces me to learn many of the characters I am not quite so good at that I would be unlikely to choose in an actual game.

Simply put, the issue at hand is that when you play Mystery Heroes, you are at the hand of RNG. Sometimes you get lots of healers and no tanks. Sometimes all tanks and one dps. Or Some variation of the mix. Obviously though, that literally is what Mystery Heroes is meant to be.

**MY SUGGESTION:** In the spirit of Blizzard pushing 2-2-2, I would like to see a system put in place where it DOES NOT force 2-2-2 in Mystery Heroes, but STRONGLY ENCOURAGES it.

*For example, there would be a 33% greater chance when you die that the next hero you play will be that of the missing role.*

I have not experimented with different inputs and values, but I am curious what thoughts you all have on something like this. Also, the same would apply if you have too many of a single type, where it becomes less likely you will get the role, while not guaranteeing you won't. I really have no idea how Blizzard currently sets up Mystery Heroes, but I imagine it's worth talking about.  


Edit: An idea I like, as suggested by IzzInks, a soft, hidden 1-1-1 might be a better idea. That way no matter what, there's always at least one healer, one tank, one dps, while still being in favour of being random/mystery. 

**WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT:** Not immediately related, but since we're already here, what's the deal with Mystery Heroes only offering a small selection of heroes to play per game? Clearly it's not truly mystery, because you will often re-roll the same exact character several times, while other characters won't show up at all. Is there a reason it's not open up to play any of the 21 characters for any single game? If Blizzard were to implement my former suggestion, I would also suggest making all characters available to be played rather than what feels like less than half of them per game.

Thoughts? Good idea? Bad? Let me know what you think! Thanks for reading."|ourcommonfear|False|https://redd.it/ejllq1|23|0.81|0|12|1|overwatch

ejuxo3|2020-01-04 10:09:14|Is it just me or is there actually a problem with smurfing and Alt accounts in competitive?|"I may be wrong to say this but I have an inmate dislike for people who derank on Alt accounts or even those who use more than one competitive account at a time. Let me explain.

For people who derank on Alt accounts in competitive: imagine being new to the game and being put into bronze, you’re trying your best to do what you can and maybe you need to learn your hero better a little bit but you just can’t seem to get to silver. I can only imagine the frustration when a normally plat (or higher) Hanzo main joins the game on the enemy team and your entire team gets shut down because of it. It’s frustrating and is really bad for people who just want to learn and get better at the game. But the big kicker: THIS PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM ENJOYING THE GAME. This ruins fun for the low tier players and is why they don’t play it much and even encourage new people not to play the game. 

For people who use second accounts on competitive: I get it you’re comp point hungry, but do you really need to be acknowledged that much? I find this especially bad for people that are trying to rank up. Why is it so hard to rank to the top? Obviously it requires a lot of game time played, which not many people have, but even then the top spots seem to be taken up by people who have multiple accounts. I feel like I’ve seen on many occasions in players that are in the top 500, it’s not so much to them about how high they are ranked in T500 but more so about how many accounts they can have that are in T500, this pushes people down to lower tiers and basically tells the top players that if they want to buy multiple accounts and have them sit at GM while others are trying to grind up through diamond or masters, that’s completely fine.

Basically, I feel like competitive would be actually more competitive if you got rid of Alternate accounts altogether. I’m not sure how this would be implemented but if it could be, I’m sure it would fix so many issues that exist in comp games."|domaverme|False|https://redd.it/ejuxo3|3|0.58|0|33|1|overwatch

Those tanks never communicate, and they play as DPS (running flanks, chasing after enemy squishies, not occupying space or escorting payload/holding the point).

It's annoying, but of course you can only control what you play and not others. When playing DPS, I maximise use of cover and play less aggressively as there's less safe space to push into.

Shouldn’t there be a progress cutoff for when a match will be cancelled when someone leaves, i.e. if you capture a point the match doesn’t get cancelled? I can understand if someone just AFKs from the start of the game so it cancels the match because it’s 6v5 but in this match everyone was active. It seems absurd that if a team crushes an opponent and captures a point that someone on the enemy team has the power to nullify all of that teamwork. The team that is dominating is essentially getting penalized for playing so well. Not to mention the fact that DPS queues are 15+ minutes for most of us.

So far this season, my stack of tanks and supports are *always* the last ones alive in a teamfight, but facing up a 4v6 all the time doesn't get us anywhere without a great amount of luck. We feel like we're being held down so hard by DPS that are refusing to cooperate, and I get the impression that the other team always stacks with DPS, and communicates correctly. I don't think this is a case of the enemy being any better or worse than us, but just our solo-stacking DPS constantly refusing to play.

I just don't know what more we can do when we run a high-mobility comp, only for the solo-DPS to choose Bastion (Happened twice so far this season). That puts us in a position of just letting the Bastion handle himself (and die) or completely switch up out comp to be more Bunker, which really isn't what we're too good with.

Before I do any reporting; is picking one character, refusing to switch when being countered and asked by the team, refusing communication, and lone-wolfing it a reportable offence? 

I watch all my matches back between our 'chill-out' breaks before concidering to report, heat-of-the-moment isn't the best time to be reporting anyone."|44414E|False|https://redd.it/ejoq0c|2|0.75|0|8|1|overwatch

ejpxzc|2020-01-04 02:12:05|I just lost over 100 SR because of leavers.|"Can someone explain what's going on? I've had leavers in the last 5-6 games I've played. I don't know if it's because it's low Plat or what, but it's extremely frustrating. Most of the time they're very winnable scenarios too. For example:

-First round on defense on Temple of Anubis, we lose the first point. Someone quits immediately. 

-Attack on Havana, we just have to get the payload to the goal and we win. We're basically .5 meters away with 3 minutes left. Someone quits. 

-Volskaya 4th round on attack. We just have to get the first tick on the second point and we've already won the first. We have 2 minutes to do this with most of our ultimates. Someone quits. 

-Busan 2nd round we just need to regain control of the point to secure the win as we're at 99%. Someone quits. 

-Attack 2nd round on King's Row. We just have to stop the payload from getting to the goal. We have them stalled at first choke. Someone quits. 

These five games all happened right in a row. And of course we got slammed right after the quitting. On top of that, I've noticed people in Plat react way too quickly and just do stuff without even thinking. They move fast, but 90% of the time, I'm convinced they're button smashing. 

I thought Gold was bad and seemed impossible to get out, but Plat is awful. People leave or throw because they don't get their way, they waste ultimates because they get tilted or they don't try to even be aware of what the other team has or is doing, Anas and Mercys pocketing tanks and leaving their other healers and DPS to die, people dying to Junkrat spam and turrets because they have blinders on and 0 awareness. If you showed me clips of some of these games and told me it was Bronze, I'd believe you. 

I'm not saying I'm perfect. Obviously I'm in the same rank. I definitely mess up, get out off position, and make hasty moves. But people just seem to get this mentality that they don't belong in their rank or they're actually better than everyone when that's not true. If you're better then you'd climb out. Part of the enjoyment of this game, at least for me, comes from learning new things and experiencing new challenges as I level. 

It's just frustrating when you're playing the game you love and other people get salty and ruin the experience. 

EDIT: Apparently I need to clarify what I expect out of this post. Please also share your experiences with leavers and how they affected you. How do you think we can change this? Is it possible? Let me know your thoughts and opinions. 

tl;dr Plat is toxic and it makes me sadface"|toews-me|False|https://redd.it/ejpxzc|0|0.44|0|11|1|overwatch
