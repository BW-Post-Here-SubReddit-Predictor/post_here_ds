**Topic: New Year's Pok√©resolutions!**

Happy new year, folks! With the new year comes a tradition many partake in: New Year's Resolutions! These are often used for providing extra encouragement to do stuff one meant to do in the previous year, but never got around to.

So with that in mind, are there any Pok√©mon-related resolutions you want to try to accomplish in the new year? Perhaps a Battle Tower/Facility in a certain game you want to beat? Catching up on the anime? Let us know what Pok√©mon-related feats you wish to accomplish in the new year!"|SnowPhoenix9999|False|https://redd.it/eie9pf|46|0.95|0|96|1|pokemon

el1vpt|2020-01-06 22:54:09|Why don't they reveal or tease new, next-gen Pok√©mon in the anime anymore? Or the movies, cards, merchandise, or spin-off games? Or literally anywhere outside of the main-series?|"Seriously, what happened to that?  The transition from Gen 1 to Gen 2 was HYPE thanks in part to all the ""leaked"" Johto Pok√©mon that appeared in the anime and movies well before they had any business doing so.  

Ho-oh was shown off in the *very first episode* of the anime, Togepi had an entire subplot w/ Misty carrying its egg for several episodes, and Marrill eventually appeared as a member of Tracy's team.  The first two things definitely happened *before* Gold and Silver were even released and IIRC the last one might have too.  Then there's the Lugia movie which came out shortly *before* the games if you lived in Japan and - through its marketing - revealed several Johto Pokemon early including Lugia (duh), Elekid, Bellossom, Snubbull, and Marill again.

By the time Gold and Silver actually came out we had seen these Pokemon in action and the anticipation made us *want* to encounter them in the games and *want* catch them.  It was kind-sorta done again between Gen 2 - 3 but then dropped off completely.  

I know they have been legit leaks from other merchandise since then (like Mareanie being shown early on a TCG box) but it's not the same and isn't intentional.  Nowadays it seems like either Game Freak or Nintendo have become overprotective of new Pok√©mon reveals and only allow them to happen as part of scheduled hype cycles in official trailers.

**TLDR**;  New species of Pok√©mon used to be teased to us in the anime months or years before there was any game for us to catch them in.  Ho-oh, Togepi, and Marill are excellent examples.  It was really cool and they should start doing it again."|Ageman20XX|False|https://redd.it/el1vpt|5|0.86|0|4|1|pokemon

It gave me the usual dry battery message, so I tried to replace it, but still no luck. Fast forward to today, I try again with new batteries I just got and still not working. The odd thing is that the first time I booted it up after replacing it is that it never gave me the dry battery error, but the second time I tried it did.

My solder skills aren't amazing, but I don't think I did anything too fucky. 

Anyone know if there's anything else that causes this error?

ekxe3p|2020-01-06 17:41:23|Okay, Sword & Shield did ONE thing right...|"I feel like for all the crap SwSh get, I have to give them this: they push for the usage of all Pok√©mon. If I‚Äôm being honest, I don‚Äôt know if this was intentional. But as soon as I got the Pok√©mon Box Link, I was excited. Every time I play a Pok√©mon game, I catch a Pok√©mon I really like but they‚Äôre too under leveled for me to bother training them. Or maybe I‚Äôll feel like the trip from a route to a town and then training for hours is a waste of time when I already have a Pok√©mon of that type on my team. With SwSh, I feel like I can just pop open the Link Box, fight a few high level Pok√©mon and rely on the exp share to use this new team member. Or I can do a raid battle, stock up on exp candies, and feed them to my new buddy. 

No longer do I have to use only six of the Pok√©mon from the game anymore. I can actually use them all without restrictions. (Minus dexit but you get my vibe.) I‚Äôm glad that I can find out that the next gym is gonna be fire type and I can actually base my team around it. Instead of just powering through with my one water type or ground type. I can go out and catch water types, train them and use them without leaving the wild area.

 The diversity in teams that I have for every gym battle is fun and exciting. I still have my faves on my team and Pok√©mon I like more than others, (Bellossom gang where you at?) but at least they‚Äôre making use of the all the Pok√©mon they kept. I appreciate that they knew that if they were gonna cut half the Pok√©mon, they were gonna make the half the kept used well. 

TL;DR, I really like that I can use whatever Pok√©mon I want minutes after catching them without spending hours training them. 

((And the move tutor and name guy in every Pok√©Center really helps with my case. If you catch a new Pok√©mon you might want to reteach it a move from before you caught it.))"|cakieepop|False|https://redd.it/ekxe3p|8|0.74|0|26|1|pokemon
eksx51|2020-01-06 11:29:18|Anyone else just HATE when a pokemon doesn't learn any STAB moves on their own?|"Like, it's just the dumbest thing and I don't understand why GF does this.

I'm playing platinum for the  first time and I'm all stoked at using Gliscor on my journey, only to realize looking on his movelist on bulbapedia that this dude doesn't learn a single offensive STAB on his own, instead having to rely on TMs/tutoring/breeding. Admittedly it's turning me off from using him but I'm puzzled that they went through the work of giving gligar a shiny new evo in 4th gen only to have him learn no flying or ground moves on his own. Honestly I don't get why gliscor can't learn earthquake on its own. And all this lore about how it can glide around the world on a single wind yet can't learn any flying moves by itself., smh.

I remember in gen 1 rhyhorn had a similar problem where it learned no rock or ground moves. Bug types had this issue too but in their defense there were like no good bug moves in gen 1.

But in gen 4? Gligar/gliscor had no such excuse. Thankfully gen 5 fixed this somewhat and gave them acrobatics but I don't get why they thought this was okay for 3 straight games."|StridentHawk|False|https://redd.it/eksx51|27|0.89|0|18|1|pokemon

To speed things up, I used the day skipping raid den glitch. I set the day on my system to before the event happened. When I checked the poke job, it said it had ?4 hours left. Seeing this, I realized things got glitchy and I reset the game. I have a box with a line level 60 rhyperior in the second slot. He is normal, nothing weird here. HOWEVER, 8 boxes to the right, I found a rhypyrior which was identical in every way. It was even found in the same location on the same day. It was also in the same spot in that box that rhyperior was in on the other box. So, has anyone else seen anything similar to this happen? Is this new, and is my save file going to corrupt?

After getting the den to have the desired pokemon is it frowned upon to then go online and host a raid so others who're more hesitant about doing the exploit have an opportunity to actually catch some of these guys? Like I don't want to ruin anyone's game experience, but I just think the game doesn't give a fair chance to players to catch them and I really appreciated when other lovely players hosted their g-max raids since it gave me a chance to actually catch a non-event g-max.

ekkcuf|2020-01-05 22:46:22|Trade evolutions are dumb and they should have been removed generations ago|"One of the most disappointing parts of the new Generation for me is that trade evolutions are still a thing - and worse - trade evolutions where you have to hold an item.

This comea of the back of some great changes to location specific evolutions simply requiring a stone now, like Glaceon, Leafeon, Vikavolt etc.

Similarly, a couple of new Pokemon like Applin and Sinnestea only need to be given an item to evolve - great!

However, if I want a Slurpuff, why in God's name do I have to give it an item, trade it to a friend (which for me is a random person online which I haven't had any issues with but still) and then have them trade it back to me.

If I want to evolve my Machoke, can't there be an easier option, such as teach it a move to evolve it or have it hold an item amd level up.

Also, they don't even make sense. Why would all these Pokemon evolve just cos they were traded? It makes more sense for a Dusclops to evolve because it made 50 Pokemon faint in battle than giving it a bit of cloth and sending it into the cloud for a couple of seconds.

We haven't had a new trade evo introduced since XY so it seems that GameFreak know they suck, so why not just get rid of them entirely?

el0vby|2020-01-06 21:43:47|"[Pokemon Sword] Having some trouble with the ""strong-looking Pokemon"" mechanic and capturing Pokemon in general - am I doing something wrong?"|"Just beat the Rock-type gym in my playthrough, and I thought I might try to get some diversity in my team as I level everyone up to face the next gym. Been riding around the Wild Area for awhile, and I keep running into ""strong-looking"" Pokemon that I can't catch (at this point my highest is 47). 

My question is, when does the game stop throwing ""strong-looking"" Pokemon at me, and exactly how does the mechanic work in terms of what kinds of Pokemon appear? 

There's a ""strong-looking"" Doublade that's been hanging around for a awhile, and no matter how much I run around, it seems like anything lower level than the ""strong"" one won't spawn. Same with some Eevees, Noivern, and a few others. 

I'm getting a bit discouraged trying to build the team I want because it seems like I'm completely locked out of obtaining certain Pokemon until I beat the game, seeing as the levels keep scaling higher every time I think I've hit the right threshold to start capturing the ""strong"" Pokemon. I don't *think* I'm trying to go after anything super rare, but just assume that anything on the Lake of Outrage (that isn't one of the more common Pokemon where there's always 40 of them at any time)  is off limits to me.

My other issue is the fact that some Pokemon just....kind of refuse to be caught? I read that the level of your current Pokemon matters, but it doesn't seem to matter for some Pokemon how high my battler is. I've been trying to capture a Mantine for days now and any time I attempt a catch, even with the thing's health in the red, it just breaks out of the Pokeballs on the first try. They aren't strong-looking and my team is always at least a few levels above them. Yet they go through 10+ Ultra balls and 20+ Great Balls every time. I had this happen with a Liepard as well, which is why I don't have one. Same with a Morgrem.

I've just kind of felt like I hit a wall trying to move forward, as if the game is forcing me to just level my current team without trying to diversify beyond the ""standard"" Pokemon. The hell am I doing wrong here?"|QuantumDrej|False|https://redd.it/el0vby|0|0.33|0|2|1|pokemon

I also really liked Barry because I thought he was funny, but Paul was by far one of the coolest rivals. People can argue that Alain was really strong as well, but I think that Paul was better than Alain, at least to me. I also might be a bit biased because the Diamond and Pearl series was my favorite, but I just really enjoyed Paul. Another one of my favorites was Drew from the Ruby and Sapphire series(plus battle frontier), especially since I support the MayxDrew ship, but i also think he was a really cool character as well.

Then I noticed in battle the shadows for the Pokemon became static and would jump around. I thought it was just lag from being online and didn't think anything of it.

But after the battle I noticed the shadows for the previous battle were following me. So I had the shadow of  my traineee,my Noivern, and a Pancham in the distance. 

While I was trying to get a good screenshot, I encountered a few battles. Each battle added a new set of static shadows on the ground, but it didn't add any shadows to the overworld map. 
After one battle, the game went black and gave me a screen that said the game had encountered an error and needed to close. 

I am mostly just sharing an interesting story. Has anyone else encountered an error like this? I thought I saw a post recently of a guy who could see his bikes shadow behind him. A very odd error, am wondering if it's lag from being online or just a glitch."|RampagingElks|False|https://redd.it/ekq5o8|7|0.85|0|3|1|pokemon
ekp9h1|2020-01-06 05:09:24|Just beat my first nuzlocke!|"This was my first attempt at a pok√©mon challange, i really liked using this team, they were:

Onion, the Venusaur

Big Pete, the Fearow

Thomas, the Snorlax

Harry, the Sandslash

Frank, the Jolteon

and last but not least

Mark, the Lapras

it was super fun, and I really liked this team, I even tried adding an extra challenge by leaving my pokemon at a lower level and not training them a lot before the elite four, unfortunately, I lost Mark on the battle against Agatha and the only survivors of the fight against blue were Onion and Thomas, but it was still a lot of fun and I think I'll start another nuzlocke run but this time on Pok√©mon Ruby, if you are getting kind of bored with pok√©mon games I definetly recommend giving a try on a nuzlocke challange, it is lots of fun to do!

ekhxce|2020-01-05 19:43:47|The undebatable reason why Ash‚Äôs Charizard disobeyed him|"Someone on YouTube named Ryan commented this on a theory video and everyone agreed:

‚ÄúCharmander was an abandoned and neglected Pokemon who was left compromised and vulnerable until rescued by Ash, its loyalty to it's previous trainer almost cost it its life. That's bound to have a fundamental effect on its perception of people and any new trainer. As a Charmander Ash was its safety net but I don't think it's a stretch to consider that it even then harbored ill feelings for people.

The turning point was evolving into Charmeleon and becoming much stronger and as such not needing a caregiver any longer and evolving again into Charizard only exaggerates those feelings, I believe the subtext of the relationship between Charizard and Ash is that Ash loves Charizard but Charizard is unwilling to accept that bond for fear that it might someday be abandoned again so what does it do? It distances itself from Ash and refuses to listen and it is so over confident in its own power that it chooses to fight only when confronted with a foe it sees as worthy and even then ignores the commands it is given, Charizards wants to prove its strength for itself so that it knows it won't ever again have to be that vulnerable Charmander left alone when it isn't strong enough for its trainer.

It was never about badges or being an experienced trainer, that wasn't important to Charizard. The reason their relationship changes is because when Charizards once again finds itself compromised after the battle with Poliwrath Ash stays with it and nurses its injuries until his hands are raw, the situation it always feared plays out and Ash rises to the occasion with an act of care and compassion that allows Charizard to to see the heart of its trainer. The love and respect that it was too afraid to reciprocate for fear of eventual rejection is finally realized and the unbreakable bond between trainer and Pokemon is forged through literal fire and ice.

Ultimately Charizard is able to realize its true strength by fighting with Ash and for Ash, the collaboration makes them a better team and better friends. I know it's cliche but as far as I'm concerned it is proof of unwavering love that brings Charizard the ability to trust in its trainer and reach its potential.‚Äù

ekprk3|2020-01-06 05:56:35|TIL: Satoshi Tajiri was a freelance writer and game reviewer before he founded Game Freak and created Pokemon.|"[https://yomuka.wordpress.com/2011/12/18/mother-1-review-by-pokemon-creator-satoshi-tajiri/](https://yomuka.wordpress.com/2011/12/18/mother-1-review-by-pokemon-creator-satoshi-tajiri/)

Back in the late 80s, he wrote a review for MOTHER in Famitsu Hisshou Hon's October 20, 1989 issue.

&#x200B;

> I went to the movies recently for the first time in forever. Lately the only movie-watching I do is through rental videos, but this time around I just knew I had to see it on the big screen: *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade*.  
>  
>It was a genuinely cinematic movie that thoroughly entertained me and lived up to everything I hoped it would be. Sometimes I‚Äôll be watching a video on my 14-inch TV set at home and catch a scene that makes me really disappointed for not having seen it on the jumbo theater screen. But *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* was *made* for watching in a movie theater; seeing it on a TV screen isn‚Äôt going to get across the full impact of the action-packed adventure.  
>  
>You can‚Äôt properly experience the fun and enjoyment of a movie on a TV. Within it are dreams and lies that can only form within the special confines of movie. The same goes for video games. Shigesato Itoi‚Äôs MOTHER is an RPG with storytelling reminiscent of Spielberg. Of course there‚Äôs a handful of cinematic methods scattered throughout the game, but I‚Äôd rather avoid explaining them in detail‚Äîit‚Äôd be rude of me to spoil the game for those who haven‚Äôt played yet.  
>  
>The draw of MOTHER is in its sense of cinematic camerawork, its music, and the scenarios Itoi put so much thought into. However, the game itself‚Äîthe game design, I mean‚Äîpresents several flimsy areas.  
>  
>Take, for example, the oversized map. The map is realistically proportionate with the size of the main characters, and it apparently dazzled a lot of people. In my opinion, a video game is not something that should make its player uncomfortable. There‚Äôs no doubt that Itoi intended to portray the towns and forests realistically, but it was so spread out that people found it hard to navigate. If there‚Äôs a chance it places a meaningless burden on the player, realism needs to be toned down into a caricature. ¬†That‚Äôs one lie that‚Äôs forgiven in video games.  
>  
>Another problem is the balance of enemy range. There‚Äôs a hierarchy to the ecosystem of animals, and the law of nature states that, in general, small creatures are weak and large creatures are strong. We instinctively understand things in this manner, so when a little pile of slime shows up on the screen, we assume it‚Äôs weak. When an enormous demon shows up, we stagger back at how strong it looks. In MOTHER, it might be due to the game‚Äôs setting in modern America, but the hierarchy of enemies isn‚Äôt that clear. The smaller-sized rope enemy is stronger than the Mad Car or Psycho Car, and the Mad Truck and Psycho Truck aren‚Äôt as strong as the smaller-sized bear, etc. That makes the map feel as if it has a relatively disorganized distribution.  
>  
>Then there‚Äôs the inadequacy of the information the game provides to the player. Dialogue in an RPG consists of two things: Hints to aid progress in the game, or entertaining lines that add to the game‚Äôs color. I hear that the developers ran out of memory halfway through production, so lots of the colorful lines were spared while they chipped despairingly at the hinting ones. Throwing away the hints and keeping the entertainment was Itoi‚Äôs clear decision‚Äîit makes the game stand out, but without them we‚Äôre left with a game that is, in reality, simply not very kind.  
>  
>These are the kinds of things that bothered me. The scenario is obviously the work of a professional writer, but I feel MOTHER might be better suited for a novel or a movie. When it comes to these difficult issues in game design, though, Itoi doesn‚Äôt seem to regard them as critical. He stated it himself: ‚ÄúI dared to break the ten commandments of video game design.‚Äù  
>  
>It‚Äôs not very believable, though, that modern video games contain whatever ten commandments Itoi was referring to. If you look at all the games on the market today, there‚Äôs a huge disparity between good games and bad games. Even with the unique production know-how of each maker, there are no apparent common traits across the spectrum.  
>  
>Before makers were understanding and following the ten commandments of game design, there *were* no ten commandments. Not even ten years have passed since video game culture brought up the new concept, so that‚Äôs basically a given. The ten commandments have yet to be created. You cannot break something that does not yet exist; it‚Äôs something we‚Äôll make from here on out.  
>  
>But the fact that games don‚Äôt have ten commandments might actually be a wonderful thing. We‚Äôre still in a happenstance of witnessing the genesis of chaotic video game culture. Isn‚Äôt it exciting to think about the future of video games and all the limitless opportunities they hold with each new development?"|RadDudesman|False|https://redd.it/ekprk3|4|0.79|0|2|1|pokemon

Back then I was obsessed with pokemon. I memorized every pokemon and their types as well as their moves and knew every gym inside and out. Now that I'm back.... I have no idea what I'm doing. I've been trying to plan what to use for SwSh and I'm finding that I don't really know how anymore. I don't know what a lot of moves do anymore, I'm not really sure how to take advantage of abilities, and I just generally don't know how to build a team.

So I'm looking for some tips on how to build a good team. I'm not looking for anything competitive, just something I can get through the game with. How do you go about choosing your pokemon? How do you cut down to only 6 when there are so many cool new ones to try? And is there a website go to post their teams and explain why they made their choices? I've tried looking up some of these things on YouTube and there seems to be a significant lack of people sharing teams.

Anything anyone can tell me about how to make choices without spending endless hours researching ahead of time would be great. I don't have the time for it like I did when I was a kid."|Lunarskies92|False|https://redd.it/ekuahh|1|1.0|0|8|1|pokemon

ekncb8|2020-01-06 02:29:12|What I would like to see improved upon for the next pokemon game|"I'm going to discuss what I think needs to be improved upon from Sword/Shield for the future installments of Pokemon

1. Bring Back the National Dex

I think this should be priority number 1 for the team. They don't need every pokemon but I would like to see at least 700+ of them or 2/3rds of all the unique pokemon that exist to make a return 

2. Route improvements

The paths in Pokemon sword and shield weren't that very good. They often felt a little too short and needed more pokemon in them. They also felt very easy and there were hardly any unique or non-straightish paths. I would like to see the return of more of a complex route system and make the town locations feel more spread out from one another so you have to be on the paths more, especially with the addition of camping

3. Better rivals

The rivals in Sword/Shield are pretty bad. I would like to see the rivals appear less but when they do appear they 're stronger and actually a challenge. 

4. An open world game/ less linear gameplay

Pokemon did something right with the addition of the wild area however I would like the whole game to be as that open as the wild area. You should be able to choose to go to different gyms more freely and what routes to take. A good idea would be to section off the gyms into groups of 3 with the final gym being unlocked when you defeated all other 9 gyms. I would also have each section not be accessible until you defeat all 3 gyms in that section. However, you would be able to choose which paths to take to go to each of the gym in the section and which gym you go to first in each chunk of game. 

5. More gyms

I think it's time for Pokemon to up from 8 gyms to 10 gyms. Also, make the gym leaders harder. 

6. Better story

The story in Sword and Shield could be better and I hope that game freak decides to invest more energy into the story. I know it's hard to ask for that and a less linear game style however I feel like it can be done

7. More to do in towns

I feel like Pokemon needs more quests similar to what you can do in games like Majora's mask. The towns feel pretty barren and I feel like adding quests or more to do in each town will make the town experience more appealing

8. Hard mode

I feel like Pokemon needs a hard mode once you beat the game so pro and returning pokemon fans can go back and play through a harder version of the game since the new games have gotten pretty easy. I would expect there to be harder gym leaders and trainer fights."|jakenimbo|False|https://redd.it/ekncb8|7|0.88|0|5|1|pokemon

The fact they actually added a free roam fly to travel rather than just some points to click on a map shows how much these games shined. I hope that if we do get the Gen 4 remake, we get ORAS stuff as well as SwSh built into it. Either bring back Megas or build upon Dynamaxing like ORAS did with megas. 

Side note: megas are the best ‚Äúnew mechanic‚Äù to be added. Z Moves felt generic and didn‚Äôt add much lore to the game and Dynamaxing seems to have similar lore value as megas and do have special properties like Megas (i.e gigamaxing) but also has a generic thing that all Pokemon can use. 

Also, removing 50% of the Pokemon isn‚Äôt something that is to much of a fuss right now but is still pretty bad. If we get a gen 4 remake and there is still a 50% cut then there will be a massive problem

Mine has always flip-flopped between Jolteon and Articuno. 

Jolteon was one of the most powerful gen 1 Pokemon when the game came out. In Pokemon stadium the base lvl 50 Jolteon rental could beat the rental Zapdos 9/10 times. With the 10th having a critical hit for Zapdos. Going thru the elite 4, with a party of 6, Jolteon could carry my team thru to Bruno on its own. Also my first ever play thru my rival had a Blastoise and guess who came.in handy? 


Articuno on the other hand was my first lvl 100 Pokemon. Ice type Pokemon were key in beating Lance, who in my opinion was always more difficult than Gary. A flying ice Pokemon tho was perfect for me. Articuno was the most elegant of the legendary Birds. Although it is considered the weakest after 7 more generations, in the beginning when dragon and psychic ruled Articuno could always be counted on."|mcguirehite|False|https://redd.it/ekqz83|2|0.76|0|19|1|pokemon

ekceoy|2020-01-05 12:26:52|Given that Pokemon Go, a 3 year old game, has made 1.4 billion in 2019 alone, is there a chance that TPC will shift their strategies towards more mobile/online gaming?|"https://www.superdataresearch.com/2019-year-in-review/ 


This amount is simply staggering, and is no where near what a main series game will ever hit. To put the numbers in perspective, it's like SwSh selling over 20 million copies at its $60 box price - and it's not even a 3 year old game.  

Given the amount of time and effort put into developing a main series game, compared to the trickling content that Niantic barely puts effort into, is it not a possible concern that TPC might move towards the development of games that cater more to the casual crowd?


Not only do these casual mobile games help expand the reach of Pokemon (my family/aunts/uncles play only Pokemon Go, and yet we watch the movie and buy plushes), they are proving to be a cash cow that keeps giving. 


Any thoughts on this? I wouldn't be surprised if TPC goes down this path, given what we see from a steadily declining production value in the main series games. Casual mobile games might be Pokemon's future."|WhereAreTheMonsters|False|https://redd.it/ekceoy|58|0.87|0|25|1|pokemon

ekm2qd|2020-01-06 00:51:04|IF I HAD A IRL POKEMON DRAFT LEAGUE|"This is a concept for an irl pokemon draft league. Tell me if you wish this was a real thing. Besides that enjoy. If don't feel like reading then watch the video. (https://youtu.be/2YcCCqpwiAw)

First we are going to start with the Basic Rules 

This League will have 12 teams. 

We will have 2 divisions

A season will consist of 60  games. The best teams go to the playoffs but we will discuss that later.

When it comes to Pok√©mon each roster will contain a maximum of 17 pokemon and a minimum of 11. No two Pokemon can be on the same team.

A team can have a minimum of 2 coaches and a maximum of 8. So teams consist of 2-8 people. 

Each team has a draft pick for each round for each year. They can trade these draft picks. 



If this league was in real life all teams would fight in actual stadiums or arenas. This sounds simple but is actually complicated. Since rosters consist of 2-8 people it is a bit obvious they cannot battle all at once. So each team picks a dedicated battler. They are allowed to call a certain number of timeouts if they want to talk things over with their team. For the stadium itself there will be a main stage where the players sit on. Below this is where the audience is. In between them is a big screen. This league would not show Pokemon showdown or 3ds/ Switch footage I have something different in mind.

My thought is the player use a program where all they see is switch and attack. The program also tells them past moves, which moves are super effective and the current Pokemon on the field. On the Screen I would use something like a Pokemon battle revolution simulator. Or Pokemon Showdown but with Pokemon Battle Revolution graphics. Not only the sprites of the Pokemon but I‚Äôm talking about the whole game, backgrounds, health bars, and move animations. 

Now we are getting into teams and playoffs. Honestly the teams can be from anywhere. Since I live in the United States teams would probably be based on locations from there. However If we were to go World Wide I definitely have in mind what the teams would be. 




New York
Los Angeles both in the US
London in the UK 
Toronto in Canada  

Sydney in Australia  
Paris 
Beijieng
Brazil 

Mexico 
Rome  
Germany 
You can decide the last one 

If we were just in the United States then 

NY 
Boston 
Chicago
Indiana 

LA
Memphis 
Texas 
Phoenix 

Detroit 
Seattle 
Las Vegas 
And You Can decide the LAst one 

For Playoffs we have two division only two teams per division  make it. However there is something like a wild card or bonus game. This is for two teams that were close but did not qualify. Those two teams play a best of one series and the winner moves on. There is a bonus game for each division Then winners play the 2nd best teams in a best of 3 series. Then the last two teams in each division play in a best of five series. Then the last two teams play in a best of 7 to decide the championship. Thye win a cool trophy or something like that. 

Lastly I want to discuss the display or scoreboard most sports have when on tv. This one has one side for each team. There are six dots. Each dot has a yellow ring.If the ring is not filled in it means the Pokemon has not been sent out. If it is filed then the Pokemon has been sent out. If it is blue the Pokemon has some type of status. If it is grey the pokemon has been knocked out. Also it will have the current Pokemon in battle and some info about it.

Like how well-designed each town is, what the Gyms are like and what the Gym Leader's/Elite Four's/Champion's/etc personality is like - I always find it fascinating to see all these little individual elements play out in the story.

Now I know the overall story of Pokemon is super-simplistic, just beat 8 people and then beat a Champion - but it's that simplicity that makes the games really easy to just relax into in my personal opinion - Pokemon just wouldn't work with those super-""dark"", super-""complex"" stories some older fans want to see in it IMO."|sexytime102|False|https://redd.it/ekjbbi|10|0.85|0|15|1|pokemon

I will say I have the tendency to not be impressed by Regional Dex completions as National/Living Dex completions, but that's more because I grew up with GSC where the National Dex was also the Regional Dex and any Regional Dex is like a ""Part 1"" of that goal. Never realized that some fans are truly intimidated with 800+ Pokemon until recently, when I thought everyone loved the fact the family just keeps growing.

It's natural being impressed to see someone actually ""catch them all"", but I guess it's more like pro sportsmen compared to amateurs -- some people don't have the time and resources to go full time doing it.

Seeing that understandably not everyone has the time and patience to finish a National/do a Living Dex, were fans very unsupportive when they only say filling a Regional Dex is fine for them?

ekk5o4|2020-01-05 22:32:33|My thoughts after beating Sword as a casual pokemon fan.|"I'm pretty casual as far as pokemon fans go. I havent played all the games (only emerald, pearl, x, let's go, sword and the gamecube games), I dont know a good chunk of the pokemon names after gen 4, and the only shiney pokemon I have ever caught in any pokemon related content ever (including go) was last week for the shiney magikarp event. 

I have seen a lot of debate on the quality of the new pokemon games and I have seen some valid complaints but I thought I would just throw in my 2 cents after beating Sword this morning.

Things I liked: 

I thought most of the new pokemon were really cool. Rillaboom is my guy. I thought the story was good enough and even though some people complained it was too short I beat it in about 30 hours after spending a bunch of time just wandering around the wild area which is just fine for me. I like some if the new animations like that one scorebunny's evolved form does where he kicks up the rock and sends it flying like a ball. I like how easy it is to get all kinds of balls. In the other games I have played I feel like it's pretty much just great balls and ultra balls. I also really like the wild area.


Things I didnt like:

While I really liked some of the animations, some could have been a lot better. I wish they had taken a little bit more time to just make the rest of them awesome. I'm not a big fan of the framedrops in the wild area when you go online but it doesnt completely ruin it for me. 

Things I'm neutral on:
Dexit. I never moved my pokemon up anyways and I would usually only use new pokemon in my team. I can see how it would upset some, but for me it actually makes me want to try to fill out the pokedex more when it's only 400 pokemon and not 1000+. I'm neutral on gameplay because I dont play pokemon a ton so it kind of felt nostalgic to me more than ""same old same old"". Another complaint I see is a lack of end game content, but as a casual player I think wandering around the wild area and maybe playing online will be good enough for me. I'm going to put dynamaxing here too because I dont think it's quite as cool as mega evolutions from x but I do like it that any pokemon can do it instead of just a few.

Overall I really liked the game. Though I have played other games this is the first pokemon game I have finished since pearl. I would recommend it to friends if they like pokemon.


Final conclusion: I think the game is great, but I see where it could have been even better as well. 8/10 as a casual player."|J-PlusPlus|False|https://redd.it/ekk5o4|4|0.63|0|3|1|pokemon

ekg23a|2020-01-05 17:32:43|Let's imagine a canonical MissingNo.|"The way I'd imagine it would have something to do with pokemon boxes. Since things like Porygon can exist It's not out of the question that something can happen in the game's digital realm. This could be a post-game activity.

\-Trainers start to report their pokemon going missing in boxes and some losing access altogether.

\-The reason for the disappearances is found to be tied to an anomaly present in boxes that have a few specific pokemon. (Those pokemon are basically gen 2 pokemon that can be found in the region and the ones that if originally transferred through the time capsule exploit result in a MissingNo.)

\-Since you're the MC you get roped into this. Enlisted by whoever's the pokemon professor or in charge of the pokemon storage system in the region. Maybe even Bill gets mentioned. 

\-You are sent out to ""lure"" it out by catching a list of said gen 2 pokemon and placing them in a proxy/trap box.

\-The bait pokemon are safely released when MissingNo. appears in the box.

The MissingNo. fight is triggered the moment you take it out of your pokemon box, since it doesn't have a pokeball it just pops out and you start the fight. 

It's flying normal type and knows only water gun (twice) and sky attack. Same as in gen1.  The fight is not too terribly difficult as it's just level 1.  It doesn't appear as it's iconic glitch form but rather as either a slightly visually mangled Kabutops or Aerodactlyl periodically switching in-between turns. If defeated it dissipates never to be seen again. It can only be captured in a standard pokeball (pokeball, great ball, ultra ball and master ball). If captured it's registered in the pokedex after the legendary but still retains it's name. If defeated it's not present in the pokedex at all. It is not necessary for dex completion. It is not shiny locked. It's shiny is just a desaturated verion of it and it's forms.

How it would function in battle:

It can switch forms. It's initial form is that iconic one but with a little more mass and maybe a visible square core with slightly altered textures of various gen 2 pokemon (again the ones that trigger it) that constantly shift around. Maybe even a callback to the surf sprite from the gameboy games. However having different pokemon in your first slot in the party can alter it's appearance. Pokemon like Cubone or Marowak giving it the ghost form, Pikachu the default form in the yellow version and the pokemon from the time capsule exploit corresponding to the Kabutops or Aerodactyl form. (as well as the ghost, yellow and regular forms.) It's different forms mainly just change up it's stats quite a lot and power up moves of certain types."|Pinguistrash|False|https://redd.it/ekg23a|9|0.81|0|2|1|pokemon

Team:

- RAPIDASH, LVL ~77

- TORTERRA, LVL ~77

- STARAPTOR, LVL ~69

- LONTRA (Floatzel), LVL ~92 (Yes, 92. The elite four is so weak, my floatzel can destroy more than half of it. That's why he's overleveled. Also I gave him 2 rare candies)

- LUXRAY, LVL ~70

- GIRATINA, LVL ~69

This is my platinum playthrough and even though the elite four is still at level 1, I find it really easy because my team is balanced for it and when I unlock the second level no pokemon's gonna change for them, they'll just have a higher level but again I do it like a speedrun I know their pattern already and I have almost a million pokedollars.

EDIT: Sorry, I need to clarify something. First of all, as I said in the post, floatzel is overleveled because it destroys more than half of the elite four, and COULD beat almost half of cynthia because of its moveset... Garchomp is a √ó4 to ice beam, roselia is √ó2 to ice beam (or I could use rapidash there, no big change), and uhhh yeah, Milotic is kinda hard to beat but with one charge and a thunder from luxray it becomes a 1 hit k.o... and yes. It's also because of its bad AI which I get an advantage from... Milotic SOMETIMES uses that psychic move that gets hit 1 time and explodes double the damage n stuff, so I take that turn to use charge and then thunder because luxray is faster and it becomes a 1 hit. Spiritomb, well, I just need to spam the shit out of earthquake. Togekiss is either beatable by luxray or torterra with a rock move. Not a big deal. Lucario isn't a big deal either. I could use staraptor, luxray with his √ó1s because he's kinna strong or rapidash with a fire move.

I'm fully aware that I'm only grinding the first level, but the second level isn't changed at all.. it's just more levels.

ekeuqo|2020-01-05 16:06:26|10 hours into Shield, from the perspective of a first timer.|"So, I've got 10 hours in Shield so far. It's my first main series pokemon game, and while there are a few faults I'm really enjoying it. 

Pros:

- Most of the new pokemon designs are great
- There are some very well-defined characters, even some of the random trainers you meet on the routes have defined personalities
- The game can look quite beautiful at times
- The gameplay is very smooth and fun
- Everything pertaining to gameplay is functional and polished, I haven't encountered any major glitches or anomalies
- Overall I'm really enioying myself playing this game

Cons:

- Characters like Leon are underutilized and not really developed - as a whole, the story is weak
- Interior areas and towns look great but some parts of the wild area have crusty or blurry textures, mainly the trees and ground
- There should not be this much pop-in, especially in smaller areas
- There are not enough shadows, especially noticable when catching pokemon
- The game is overall very easy, which some people will get turned off by, but this isn't a con for me - I'm having fun, so I'm not bothered by difficulty

Overall, most of the issues I have are strictly graphical. The dex cuts have not bothered me one bit so far, and the game is a lot of fun. It's not perfect, no game is, but right now I would give this game a solid 7.5 out of 10.

ek9okm|2020-01-05 07:09:31|My thoughts on Pokemon Shield|"Ive been a Pokemon fan for years, but still i'm fairly young. My first game was X and Y, and I've also played Sun and Moon. After beating Shield a few days ago I felt like it was...missing something from the games I've played?

When it comes to story, I really wasn't that engaged from the start so yes there is bias there. I felt like it was somewhat uninteresting. I know that in all pokemon games the main goal is becoming champion, but it never was just that as they all had other elements. I just feel like becoming champion was your only big goal throughout and it's understandable as the villain is only officially revealed at the very end. Even then his reasoning felt, shoved in as I don't recall Galar's energy being a problem that was established? There's a major chance I've missed a bunch as my run is around 24 hours and I haven't played any after game content.

The characters really did make up for the story however. I really love Hop and his little arc he has. I really like the rivals in general, but still the other characters are kinda meh. Leon especially was someone I didn't really like. Ironically, I think in general the game is very beautiful to look at, and the different environments and color schemes are super nice. The animations are very fluid as well.

But of course the overlying problem I do have is the pokemon selection, and pokemon in the game in general. To me, it just felt like Pokemon were not as important as they have in other games. I always have a list of pokemon I try to include in all my teams, that being Absol, Salamence, and Sylveon. So of course hearing that I could only get Sylveon was a major disappointment. Although it's a very pretty game, I'd take a national dex over good graphics any day. Pokemon should always be the focus in my opinion so sacrificing that is a major thing.

Overall I enjoyed it, but not as much as Sun and Moon. To be fair it's such a different game, and it had major changes like the lack of a real elite four and gyms but they pulled it off. Not every game as to follow the same rules, but certain things shouldn't be changed you know? I kinda wanna know what other people feel about this, if you share my opinions or not and if I missed out on anything that would change my name otherwise."|Fehkoala911|False|https://redd.it/ek9okm|16|0.68|0|14|1|pokemon

ekjeyv|2020-01-05 21:37:13|Pokemon: Disappointment Version|"(Disclaimer: My brother bought a copy of Sword. I warned him not to do it, but he didn't listen. Which is fine. If people want to buy the game, that's their choice. However, I stuck to my boycott. He ended up not liking the game, so I asked to borrow it. This is my mini review.)

Pokemon Sword is overall a disappointment. More disappointing than I expected.

Let me start out with the pros. I only have two.

1 I like the camp mechanic. Hope it's expanded upon in the future. (Let's be honest. It won't be.)

2 I like many of the new Pokemon designs.

Now for the cons:

Constant handholding. Worse than Sun/Moon in that regard.

Pokemon wild area level restriction. Why can't I catch the high level Pokemon in the wild area? Balance? Lol like balance exists when every single action gives your entire team EXP.

Pokemon don't follow you even though we see them walking around in the wild area.

Too easy. Pokemon has always been easy. However not like this. And it's because of the EXP share, and the fact that almost everything awards EXP. And why is there no hard mode by now? Gen 5 had one. Gen 5 had an easy mode, a hard mode, and a normal mode. All 3 were more challenging than this.

Nat Dex cut. My second biggest issue with the game. It needs no explanation.

And my number one issue with the game is:

The forced EXP share. There's absolutely no reason this shouldn't be a optional. None whatsoever. Combined with the fact that catching Pokemon awards EXP... It's ridiculous.

These games are a mess. More disappointing than I expected. And I expected disappointment...

I never thought I'd see such a successful franchise be handled so poorly. Never thought I'd see a franchise this huge take so many steps backwards. And on new hardware too.

These could've been great if the creators cared. They should've been great. Look at Mario, and Zelda for example. Look at the leaps they made. I wasn't asking for something as great as those. Although that would be nice. I just wanted these games to be at the very least as good as Sun/Moon. (Which are both pretty low on my personal ranking of the series.)

ekitpx|2020-01-05 20:45:29|I've seemingly regained some interest in the anime after losing it.|"# SPOILER ALERT!

&#x200B;

I was a fan of the anime, watching AG, DP, and BW (back when it came out and before I rewatched it, I actually liked it), but of all the seasons I've watched, I like nothing more than I liked XYZ (maybe a more detailed explanation later on). Just a season full of the best character development, shortest filler, and the culmination of almost three years of anime. I tuned out of it after Kalos ended. I mean, I still remember that there was a huge amount of backlash to what happened in the Kalos League (I still hear fucking ""Burasto Ban"" and Brock's famous ""fire beats water"" in my damn nightmares) and then poor Sun and Moon's art style. I remember that Sun and Moon was received with tons of hostility. The end of XY received 5.2 (*after* the backlash) and first of SM received 3.6, which is a pretty bad fall, ngl.

Moving from the objectively better art style of previous seasons to a much less mature, less angular design was really a bad move in terms of how fast they did it and at what time they did it. XYZers like myself were just walloped by the league and we kind of sort of vented it off on Sun and Moon, which I think now was a bit unfair. But at the time, it felt like the best we could do to stave off the disappointment, desolation, and despondency by venting it off on another series which looked extremely inferior in comparison. Although I still think the art style was utterly inferior, I apologize for the actions of myself and my comrades. I wasn't as mature then as I am now.

I'm still a bit salty about him losing in Kalos, though the raw pain has abated since then (I say, as the injustice begins to well up in my heart and the XYZ theme starts intensifying).  In any case, I abandoned the series after that and after Serena left ~~who is the best girl, fite me in showdown rn, skrubs~~. Something I forgot to mention is that airport scene at the end cooled me a bit. I absolutely freakin' loved it and it served as a proper conclusion to the romance subplot. Likewise, I ""hope and assume"" that they get together in the future. Without that, I think that I would have been gone for good, especially after that damn league (DORAGON CRO! BURASTO BAN!).

Three years later, I've found myself leaping into anime overall and...actually getting back into Pokemon a bit. But I just can't watch Sun and Moon, I don't know why, I just can't, no matter what. Maybe it's just the fact that *it* was what replaced XYZ and that it was meant to serve as a continuation after changing so much of what made XYZ great for me. And because of that, I feel a bit let down by Ash's win in the Alola league as opposed to Kalos, where it looked like he had everything going for him, even the hype train.

But, anyways, I've been getting a bit interested by the new series, which seems to want to combine the XY and SM art styles into something I find a bit more appealing. I don't think it's as good as XY, but for me, it's watchable. The pain of not having my best girl is still there, but since the anime is just beginning and looks to have something a bit more refreshing, I think I want to try and give it a shot. Hopefully, it gets more serious in the later episodes and seasons. I want another XYZ-esque serious season, just Ash being epic all around and getting the love and development he did there. This might just be me not watching Sun and Moon, but I don't think it ever reached XYZ levels of seriousness, though I've heard from others that there have been moments that are close to it.

The latest Hoenn episode did pique my interest. He was shown beating Houji with his two Pokemon team and he seems to be more a ""mentor figure"" to Gou than legitimately being an inexperienced trainer who's travelling around Galar (**cough** BW **cough**). Houji looked to be a bit incompetent, sending out a Hariyama to fight a Mr. Mime, but, as we all know, the anime doesn't follow game rules (Electric attacks on a ground type Pokemon? Fire beating water?). And Pikachu beat that Mightyena, which was pretty cool. It's shaping up to be better than Sun and Moon, but not close to better than XY or XYZ yet. It's only 7 episodes in, though. That could all change after a while. So, yeah, Ash seemed a bit more competent here than he was in SM or BW's beginnings, so this is giving me some hope.

Next episode seems to be running to Sinnoh, then the next transitions on to Johto? Idk, it feels a bit too fast for me. And they have that Piplup and Croagunk in the next episode (really subtle, guys, really, *really* subtle). It seems more like fanservice for me, like returning to Kanto for two freaking episodes. I really wanted a few more episodes, but it was instead just used to get at people who love Gen One and just overall grab at nostalgia. They could be removed and replaced with regular episodes set in Alola or even another region we haven't seen in a while, like Hoenn or Sinnoh, maybe, to get the same point across. It was just there for the sake of nostalgia, which I dislike immensely. Fanservice *just* for the sake of fanservice isn't something I usually like.

What's your opinion on this? Are these episodes just there for fanservice or is there something more important behind it? Is it necessary and do you think it was a good or bad idea?

But overall, this series still got me interested, even though it's practically just filler right now.

tl;dr I was turned off by Sun and Moon and am getting interested by the new series.

ek1oyy|2020-01-04 20:09:02|I like Alola|"Yeah that's what this post is about. I've always loved gen 7 (Sun and Moon, Ultra Sun and Moon). The characters and story in the original sun and moon are great. I know many are put off by the emphasis on story but I honestly love it. I can see why people would dislike it though and is probably why gen 7 is hated(at least from what I've seen). The alola region is a very fun region to explore and is very unique. Totem battles were challenging and interesting battles. The new pokemon are great(Rowlet might be my favorite pokemon of all time). The music is great in this gen too. Post game content is obviously not as big as other games which is a legitimate criticism. Sun and moon still had some stuff to do though such as:Exploring more of Poni Island, catching the tapus, Ultra beast sidequests, catching necrozma, and doing some post game battles(such as guzma and faba). USUM had even more content with ultra wormhole riding and team rainbow rocket. I will admit it isn't the best post game but isn't the worst either. Their are problems with it:First island drags, USUM ruins the original Sun and moon's story, and Z moves are lame. But man did I enjoy gen 7 even when it first came out.

In my opinion they‚Äôre a highlight of the game in some cases, with an exception of Sun and Moon where they seem like an afterthought but are still a part of the game that contributes. If you were to remove Team Yell from the game completely and replace them with random NPCs doing the stuff they were doing, then the game would not change in a massively noticeable way, and any changes would be for the better.

They‚Äôre just a time waster. They‚Äôre not even a mild challenge- they all have 1-2 Pokemon, I think the most I can remember one having was 3. There‚Äôs not even a leader of Team Yell. I guess you could say Marnie is the leader but she isn‚Äôt *really* affiliated with them in any sense other than that they are *her* supporters. She asks them to do something one time that I can remember and it‚Äôs for *your bloody benefit*.

At the beginning of the game they seemed promising, like they would go to great, evil lengths to keep other participants from entering the Gym Challenge. But after the first time they say that, they never even bring it up again once that I could remember.

ekfzll|2020-01-05 17:27:53|If Pokemon was hard rebooted, what would you change, what would you keep?|"Things like the battle system, story progression, acquisition of items/mons, etc.

Personally, I would make the following changes:

**Combat** \- I would straight up take a system kind of like SMT4 or the Digimon World games for DS and apply that. You would have 3 party members and up to 5 backup members. Encounters would be anywhere between 1-5 pokemon at a time ,trainers would have the same limitations as the player. Positioning of party members would be a thing as there would be 5 horizontal spaces on each side, moves would affect different spaces. An example of the battlefield would be something like below

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | (Back, enemy)



| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | (Front, player)

**Progression** \- Instead of adhering to having an aim of 'beat the gyms/trials, challenge the League' with the stronger plot elements generally acting as interruptions, have an actual story, with what you do being generally centered around it, like a traditional RPG. I really liked the concept of Totem bosses, so I would apply this in the way of having groups of suped-up pokemon, either wild or trainer battles, as boss battles, with Legendaries mostly being superbosses for post game, not being involved a lot, if at all with the story. The bosses would have higher stats and different move pools, making them unique encounters.

**Acquisition** \- Pokemon can still be caught with balls, and you would be able to catch pokemon in wild encounters regardless of how many pokemon are still fighting. Items could be given out as battle rewards, with evolutionary items dropping from pokemon of that type as rare drops (eg. water stone from water types, metal coat from steel types)."|OhDearGodItBurns|False|https://redd.it/ekfzll|2|0.56|0|11|1|pokemon

ek7yk9|2020-01-05 04:22:57|Do we still need all these Gender Differences?|"With the newest game cutting a large number of Pokemon in theory to save on room in the game and model-making, I have to wonder... can we just  safely wipe away most of the gender differences between Pokemon appearances? It was a cool idea when it debuted in Gen 4, but it seems like even GameFreak realizes it was a dumb idea because almost nothing in later gens have them. 

Now, I'm not saying we should cut out all the gender differences, certainly. The Gen V+ ones like Pyroar and Unfeazent are real alternate appearances that matter,  and even some of the older ones like female Venusaur's seed, female Pikachu's heart tail, and Wobbuffet's ridiculous lipstick are cool, but most of them are so minor you have to be looking for them to notice them, and some of them are so small that even when you ARE looking it's hard to tell.

Many female pokemon, for example, have a smaller horn or tusks than their male counterpart. The thing is, with the exception of Donphan, none of them are really a big enough difference to notice without directly comparing a male and female. While this is fine and realistic, it does mean that the game is holding two models for a lot of pokemon that really aren't benefiting from it. 

I propose that nearly all gender differences be either exaggerated or scrubbed, depending on the specific.  Female Butterfree has small spots? Screw that- female butterfree has a different wing pattern, or looks the same as male butterfree. Female ALakazam has smaller whiskers? How about just no whiskers?  Female Rhyhorn/Rhydon/Rhyperior has a smaller horn? How about instead, males have the two horns and females only have the nose horn but not the forehead horn? And we add the forehead horn to male Rhyhorns? 


I know some people are going to like the gender differences and all that, and I'd be happy to haggle on which ones should stay and which ones should go and which ones should be modified, but I'll be honestly surprised if anyone here can both tell me the difference between a male and female Ursaring without looking it up and, when shown a picture of a single Ursaring, identify if it's male or female. And this goes for... most pokemon with gender differences.




On a side note, now that Meowstic and Indeedee prove that it's possible, can we just erase the extra Nidoran from the pokedex going forward?"|BardicLasher|False|https://redd.it/ek7yk9|13|0.67|0|21|1|pokemon

ekjb18|2020-01-05 21:25:49|A Pokemon game with all the regions|So I've been thinking about this for awhile now and after beating sword/shield I think that the newer Pokemon games are a bit too short. So i think that with the jump to the switch it would be possible (yet unlikely)  to have a game with all the regions. Each region would be about the length of Galar (witch i beat in 12 hrs). Pokemon balancing would be difficult (especially with raids) so what I would do is change the level cap from 100 to 200 allowing for Pokemon to level up through out the game. you would chose your starting region from 3 options Kanto, Johto, and Galar or Kalos (depending on version). the levels of Pokemon would change based on the order that you go to the regions. I think that you would be able to got to the regions in any order as long as Alola is last because its environment is so different from the other regions (and its far away). furthermore eveywhere would be walkable (or surfable/water bikeable) there would be fast travel but it is not necessary (ala Xenoblade). Megas and Dynamaxing would be present but not Z-Moves (they didn't add much other than cut scenes) you would unlock Megas in Kalos and Dynamaxing in Galar. There would be a wild area in each region (where the safari zone is if that region has one. In Alola a under water volcano erupts to create a new island for the wild area.).

ekhi0t|2020-01-05 19:13:44|Generation Theory: The pattern of gen and remake releases.|"Forgive me if this has been discussed or theorized before. A quick search had revealed theories kinda similar but not similar enough. Anyway:

I've noticed a pattern with Pokemon core game and remake releases.

Each core generation came out on each iteration of Nintendo's handhelds and each remake came out on each generation of Nintendo's handhelds. 

Gen 1 - Game Boy
Gen 2 - Game Boy Color (a half step)
Gen 3 - Game Boy Advanced
Gen 4 - Nintendo DS
Gen 5 - Nintendo DSi (another half step)
Gen 6 - Nintendo 3DS
Gen 7 - ""New"" Nintendo 3DS (half step)
Gen 8 - Nintendo Switch

And the remakes:

Gen 1 - Gameboy Advance
Gen 2 - Nintendo DS
Gen 3 - Nintendo 3DS

So with this information, we should expect Gen 4 remakes on the Switch, Gen 9 on Switch Pro (if that exists), Gen 10 on Switch 2 (or whatever it'll be called) as well as the Gen 5 remakes.

Now, granted, I know it wasn‚Äôt the studios ‚Äúmain‚Äù focus during development, as they had their ‚ÄúA team‚Äù working on other projects, but the amount of love and reverence packed into this game is astounding.

From all the unique little models to the way they interact with each other, I can feel the developers really cared that players get the personality of each mon at just a glance. Speaking of the mons, I like how not all evolve in the same way! Having to fulfill specific requirements to get some to finally evolve is a rewarding experience in and of itself. And being able to ride them on occasion is just a treat.

I‚Äôve been with the series since I was a kid, and every call back they made felt like it was earned and made with care and love. Seeing old favorites pop up all over the place really got my nostalgia muscles twinging. Sure, you can say that they‚Äôre just pandering to the fan base with some inclusions and highlights, but I say the more the merrier!

Now, I know it‚Äôs not as graphically polished as some of their older games or even games from the same system, but it has a certain delectable charm.

Third is Spook, which makes it so that, when hit by a super effective move, the Pok√©mon loses all weaknesses, but gains one for Normal- and Fighting-Type moves.

The last of the current four is Cannibalise, which only appears on Gowwend, and has only a five percent chance of appearing. When the opposing Pok√©mon‚Äôs ability is triggered, one Pok√©mon in your party faints, and Gowwend loses all weaknesses, but gains one for Ghost-Type moves, essentially making it 4x weak to Ghost-Type moves."|FreezeShot|False|https://redd.it/ekbykh|1|0.58|0|4|1|pokemon

ek7yy2|2020-01-05 04:23:59|My opinion on Sword and Shield! I know I know I'm late =) I'm sorry about it.|"The games have been out for about 2 months and I was finally able to play them Christmas day.

I had intentionally been one of the ones who said they wouldn't spend money on it until it was used or the price went down or something. But my sister bought me the dual pack. I kinda panicked???? After seeing all the backlash and everything I was debating on telling her to take it back, but I couldn't because I wasn't even supposed to know about the gift.


So I took a deep breath and decided to just try to play it as if I never heard the reviews and pretended Dexit was nonexistant. I had time to decide what I wanted to do with the games and how I wanted to enjoy it.

So like pretty much most of the pokemon fandom I've been playing since before gen 6. I started in gen 2 on the original Gold in 2004 and bought Emerald either in '05 or 6. Emerald brought me into the series and I've played every game since; with my two favorites being Emerald and the Ranger series ‚ô°.

Dexit is a very hard pill for me to swallow still. I miss Dragonite and Jigglypuff ( super angry over the fact they picked Clefairy over Jiggly =/ ) and all my other beauties that got cut. But honestly it's not a bad game.

Yes I get it. I could do without the long ass story and fucking Hop being a little b**ch but it wasn't bad! What people fail to realize and also forget about is that even though most of us have been playing since the original games, it's still a game that's aimed for kids.

That being said, a lot of people would argue that they played Blue or Gold or whatever the game as a child and they did just fine. There was no need to "" dumb "" it down. I get it and I agree but I also see their side to it. I played Gold and Emerald when I was 5 & 7. I remember choosing Chikorita and Mudkip and thinking that they were just such amazing pokemon that people would quake with fear when they saw me and that they'd be able to beat anyone. I never trained any other pokemon besides my starter and would cry super hard and everything when I couldn't beat it or got stuck. I'd either reset the whole game or harass my sisters to beat it for me. Coming from that perspective, kids can know literally just use their starters and still have the rest of their team level up and I appreciate that. Going back as an adult and playing through gen 1 and gen 3 and even gen 2 for that matter, I know now to train more than just my starter. 

The boss bases were extremely hard for me as a kid. I would get really bored and end up dying before reaching Archie or Giovanni. I'd get lost in them and then Victory road in gen 3 ( going back now its freaking easy ) fucken killed me. Gen 4 to get to Palkia was fucken hard and then CYNTHIA. MAN THAT'S HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE ELITE 4 LEADER BECAUSE SHE WOULD ANNIHILATE ME. I remember even going back and playing pearl she was still super hard to beat even with training and being older with more experience.

Seeing that, I understand why they've done what they've done with the newer gens. Even with dexit. Like it was pointed out to me; over 800+ mons are in the series. For people who have all the games and for people who've been playing for eons, it's really overwhelming. Those who've completed their dex and even have a living ( I've done it twice and it's terrible ) it's super hard to do so I understand why they did what they did even though its sucks donkey balls that some of my favorites got axed.

The games themselves are fun! I love the wild area and for as long as I can remember I know I always wanted the opportunity to play pokemon on TV. Since I couldn't afford Pokemon Box or anything the first game I ever played in TV was Let's Go Eevee and I was ecstatic even though they were just more Kanto remakes. 
I was even more excited though to have an actual main series game that wasn't a remake or spinoff to play on the TV. So that helped me get hyped for Christmas.

The true blessing in the game though is not having to train those damn gen 5 pokemon all the way up to get their evos üò©. Let's face it, everyone whose ever played gen 5 knows of the struggles of training those stupid things to 40 or 50 even 64 ( looking at you Hydrogen -_- ). You can literally catch almost every evo in the wild area.

I loved the Gym Missions. Way better than just walking into the gym leader and going through little passages and whatever the case. I even like all the gym leaders =) Piers being my favorite ‚ô°. The ice gym mission was such a blessing in my opinion because I didn't have to step on those stupid squares and get all of them and try not to fall in. IT LITERALLY TOOK ME THREE HOURS TO GET THROUGH FREAKING WALLACE BECAUSE OF THAT. I kept falling and ugh just super irritating =I

Everything aside though, all in all it could have been a worse game. In my opinion it was better than gen 4 story wise ( I absolutely hate gen 4 though so any game is better than it)( But I loved Cynthia ). But was it the best? No. I dunno if its maybe my internet or what but my game lags in the wild area on internet, which is okay I guess just a bit annoying. I could do without Hop being basically like Bianca and freaking Shauna; whining over not being able to win and how they feel inadequate because of it. I mean it's something we've seen in game  before and it just gets annoying. Though I am happy with how his story ended up though it more or less ends up being like Bianca. He's literally like Shauna with the whining and Bianca with the end of his story.

I miss the days when rivals were actual rivals v.v . 
And I could have done without 50% of the story. It was just way too long. But all in all besides for that the only complaint I really have is post game, but I like shiny breeding and this gen brought around a lot of cute mons so that has me occupied right now =). Otherwise there's kinda not much to do and I'm okay with that. Gives me time to go back to pokemon Crystal and hit lugia's shiny up and everything =)

I would recommend buying it. Just be aware that it is easy and that there are changes in the game. But its not a bad game. Again not the best; but not the worst either. About a 6 maybe a solid 7? 
To those of you who throughly enjoyed it, I'm glad that you enjoyed your experience =) everyone deserves to have fun during pokemon. And that's one other thing to keep in mind! It's just a game! Have fun with it! If you think you'll have fun with it; buy it!

I'm glad my sister got me the games. I enjoyed them. Would I ever play it more than twice( only to get a living dex )? No. But I'm glad I got to have this experience and I don't regret it at all =)."|Tothemangawhore|False|https://redd.it/ek7yy2|4|0.61|0|6|1|pokemon

ek52mo|2020-01-05 00:20:31|A Suggestion/Rant Regarding Pok√©mon Animations|I believe GF should use walking/running animations in battles and not just overworld (like have them walk around the 3D arena dynamically, that'd be pretty cool too) and increase camera manipulation too. For example, with Boltund and the move Crunch, GF should move the camera in front of Boltund where Boltund runs up towards it and then cut to the opponent Pokemon with the Crunch animation. Manipulating the camera in this way would be really cool, as well as using those walking/running animations more often (I just find them really underused, in my opinion).  I noticed it in Colosseum and I found that really cool. Just my opinion though ahaha, thank you for reading my small rant.|Da_Lyricman|False|https://redd.it/ek52mo|5|0.87|0|0|1|pokemon

ek4nza|2020-01-04 23:48:13|I think Falinks might be a Doctor Who reference|"So, as we know, Galar is based off England, and Doctor Who is a very big part of British culture, so naturally there should be a reference or two in Seord and Shield. I think that reference may be the pokemon Falinks






https://imgur.com/gallery/5mA1pSV
This is a picture of shiny Falinks






https://imgur.com/gallery/50gtTYb
And this is a picture of a Dalek from Doctor who





I think they have a similar colour scheme on their armour, brown bodies with brighter yellowish highlights. Both of them also have blue eyes.


Their sword pokedex entry and their signature move, no retreat, seem to be a thematic reference to the daleks. They take orders, which are absolute. No retreat prevents them from leaving battle and boosts every stat, which is similar to how the daleks never retreat until they've won.

They're found in the wild zone at the lake of outrage. This could be a reference to a point constantly brought up in Doctor Who that Daleks only feel rage and hate. They're also found at route 8, a desert-like area, which may be a reference to the barren landscape of Skaro, the planet the Daleks come from.





I know it might see like a bit of a stretch, but I feel like there's enough evidence that it may actually be intentional. Let me know what you think, and remember that this theory is completely speculation on my part.

EDIT: I've realised its abilities may also be references to the Daleks. Battle armour could be a reference to Dalek armour being ridiculously strong and Defiant could be a reference to the Dalek's incredible offensive abilities"|Dafatdude1|False|https://redd.it/ek4nza|5|0.66|0|9|1|pokemon
ek8283|2020-01-05 04:31:48|Shinies Everywhere|"So I've been playing Pok√©mon for almost 20 years now and I had never come across a shiny in the wild. Statistically, you would think I would've gotten at least one shiny in the hundreds of hours I've played these games. The only game where I completed my dex to get the shiny charm was Let's Go Pikachu, and thus far, nothing.

Flash forward to Sword/Shield and it's like the universe is balancing itself out. I don't even have the shiny charm and I have gotten two shinies‚Äîno chaining, no breeding, just completely random encounters. My shiny Goldeen and Shiftry don't look too different from their normal forms, but it's OK, I'm just stoked to finally have shinies! Plus I got a shiny Magikarp from the raid event a few days ago.

ejvj8w|2020-01-04 11:21:38|My one real complaint about Pokemon Sword and Shield|"I really did enjoy playing Sword, despite the dex cut. It was never as bad as during Let's Go when I was like 'oh I want to use this Pokemon but they cut the bloody evolution out'. There were enough pokemon with no cut evolutions for me to enjoy it without the cut looming on me. Sure I'd love to play with the Giratina I raised in Ultra Moon from level 1 (HGSS event) but I can do that in Sinnoh remakes probably.

My real problem with the game is actually nothing to do with the Pokemon themselves, or Hop although I hear people get pissy over him. Lillie and Hau never bothered me in Sun and Moon because despite them being a huge part of the plot you could do things, save the world, it was still your story in a way. 

However in this game the actual plot was all shoved into the last few hours, you really did nothing apart from fight Team Yell and the typical league stuff. There was so much hinting of things going wrong, Leon was actually doing his job as a champion but I wish we hadn't been left out of the action until literally after the 8th badge. 

I wish we could have seen and actively participated in these things because even in X and Y you actually did things in the story although it was rehashed stuff. The story of Sword and Shield is perhaps because of this actually my least favourite because they were so many missed opportunities. They could have kept the adult characters competent whilst letting us get involved in things before the very end of the game"|LouisCyphre6|False|https://redd.it/ejvj8w|49|0.8|0|25|1|pokemon

ek7hi4|2020-01-05 03:40:49|Question about catch rates for pokemon black1|"This is my first time playing a Pokemon game beyond first and second gen. I've played emerald before so maybe gen three as well. Those games, catching mon was really simple, never had trouble. In Black, I'm finding a good number so far decently annoying to catch. I struggled with Woobat until I realized a dusk ball would be best for it. I tried like fifteen times with normal pokeballs and got him on the first try with the dusk ball. (Playing emulator so I didn't waste that many balls, kept re-loading on each failure to catch) 

Now I'm trying to catch a Blitzle. It's my first time seeing it so I have no clue if it's super common or not, I'm wondering if there is a certain pokeball to use for *this* mon? I looked up what ball to use for it but the graph seemed wrong or I read it wrong. It said the regular pokeball has a 100% catch rate if the HP is low. The HP is in the red, another hit and it will faint. 

Tl;dr: what pokeball should I use to catch a level 10 blitzle with red/low HP?

ek0yce|2020-01-04 19:14:14|How did You get into Pokemon?|"I think this is a nice thing to talk about.

The first thing I can remember about Pokemon is when I was watching the DP anime at 4. I wasn't hardcore but I certainly enjoyed it.

For the next 5 years I would watch other parts of the anime including B/W, Advanced and X/Y. I knew at this point the games existed but didn't know much about  them as I only got a Wii at 7 and a Wii U at 9.

In February 2016 I was browsing the E-shop when I saw announcements for Sun and Moon. I was intrigued so I watched MunchingOrange's playthrough of X/Y.

**I loved it.**

From then on I followed all the trailers for Sumo and I anticipated the day I'd get a 3DS to play X and eventually Sun. On my 10th birthday I got X with a New 3DS XL and for Christmas I got Sun. Now I have played almost every region and I'm waiting to finish Dragon Quest XI so I can play Leaf-Green and White 2.

ek5llk|2020-01-05 01:03:21|Predictions for the next Pok√©mon game:|"First Reddit Post so let‚Äôs try this out

So I‚Äôve been wondering what the new Pok√©mon game will be like and I‚Äôve made a few predictions! Comment any predictions you have!

We all know/hope that it will be a diamond and pearl game right? So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna go off of.
They most likely will bring Gigantamax back, due to mega evolution being brought to the previous remake when it was a big mechanic.

They most likely will be Dexit-ing again, but the sinnoh Pok√©dex of 106 (plus pre and after evolutions making it 146) will most likely be there.

Each Gym Leader has a signature Pok√©mon by the anime or the Black and a White 2 tournament, so we can kind of pinpoint the Gigantamax forms.
Rock type Gym Leader Rorark- Rampardos (for a future battle not in the original gym battle.)
Grass type Gym Leader- Gardenia- Roserade
Fighting type Gym Leader- Maylene- Lucario (he was going to get one anyways)
Water type Gym Leader- Crasher Wake- Floatzel
Ghost type Gym Leader- Fantina- Mismagius
Steel type Gym Leader- Byron- Bastiodon (giving the fossils both Gigantamax forms) 
Ice type Gym Leader- Candice- This is a hard dedication between Abomasnow and Frosslass but I‚Äôm going to go with Frosslass as the former has a mega already and the most weaknesses of all Pok√©mon.
Electric Type Gym Leader- Volkner- Luxray
So that gives us 8 of a possible estimated 21-25 Gigantamax Forms (estimate is in comparison to mega evolutions from x and y to oras and swsh to a future game)

So in Diamond and Pearl the threat is much more realized than Alola or Galar. Team Galatic is one of the most powerful/menacing teams in Pok√©mon history.  There are no predictions to how it would be different, but it‚Äôs just going to be different than it‚Äôs counterparts in previous games.

I think that dialga and palkia will get Gigantamax forms or just new forms because they need to change it a bit since a lot of people joined in at generation 4, and they already know the story aspect. OrAs‚Äôs story got changed because of the primal forms and it was successful. So I think they are going to do that to Diamond and Pearl.

They stopped with events that have a actual gameplay aspect with the legendaries (Darkrai and the dream island and Arceus and the special item)
So nobody knows which legendaries will be actually accessible besides Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina. It‚Äôs super hard to guess, but I‚Äôd be sure that they would include Arceus in SOMETHING. The literal god of Pok√©mon doesn‚Äôt seem to get much attention in games. The only time he has been physically in the game was the one event from the Sinnoh games. Cresscelia and Heatran would only be in the game for a tiny side mission. These two although being great Pok√©mon get overshadowed by the rest of the ensemble of legendaries. Darkrai and Arceus to me seem like two post game Pok√©mon. Darkrai accidentally reaving havoc among Sinnoh residents with its nightmares eventually leading up to a climax that you need Arceus to defeat. Obviously it‚Äôs not going to be that but just something to think about.

Cynthia is no doubt the best Champion (Steven being a close second)  and Pok√©mon knows it.  Her main Pok√©mon is a Garchomp, so her Garchomp will probably get a Gigantamax form. It will probably get a lot of effort in its design due to Cynthias reputation. (Like Leon‚Äôs Charizard) 

The Elite Four will make a triumphant return as it is a remake.
Lucian is a Psychic Type Trainer and his Gigantamax Pok√©mon is a weird one, but I thought his would be Girrafirig. I mean come on, think of the designs! A tall giraffe with a giant face on its tail. The possibilities are endless! 
Bertha is a Ground Type Trainer and her Gigantamax Pok√©mon I think would be Hippowodon. A total underrated Pok√©mon that deserves some attention. 
Aaron is a Bug Type Trainer and even though it wasn‚Äôt a Bug type it basically is, Drapion would be the Gigantamax Pokemon on his team. It‚Äôs previous evolution is a bug type and it‚Äôs his signature Pok√©mon so Wynaut?
And then there is Flint... yeah that guy. He‚Äôs a Fire Trainer but let‚Äôs be honest his team would have to be heavily modified since there were only two fire types on his team. Magmortar is his signature but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Gigantamax material. Rapidash just got some attention from the Galarian Form. I think that they would have to bring in a Pok√©mon from a different region. And just the one that comes to mind is Chandelure. Maybe a kind of chandelier at a fancy table with floating chairs and plates? 
And with that there are 13 forms out of my estimate 21-25.
There also is a strong chance that the three starter Pok√©mon will get special forms too! There have been some amazing fan arts of Gigantamax Torterra! Look them up! 
16/21-25
From here on are less evidenced forms.
Vespiqueen also seems dripping with possibilities, also Lopunny is a likely candidate!
This is just a hope- but I really hope Crobat gets a Gigantamax form! Favorite Pok√©mon and it could be a fun vampire bat form with a coffin and everything and a Dracula cloak! 
Luminneon I think is a very very very underrated Pok√©mon. It is admittedly not the best Pok√©mon but a Gigantamax form could change that!
Staraptor is the regional bird so there‚Äôs a chance of a new form.
Last but not least there is Milotic, which is a very famous Pok√©mon. It‚Äôs litterally the Beauty Pokemon or something like that. 

They might not even do Gigantamax, which kinda would make sense since it has something to do with the land of Galar but even so the Pok√©mon team has to notice that new forms make fans the most hype. And even if they don‚Äôt G-max these Pok√©mon I think have a high chance of getting a new form or something. Comment down any Pok√©mon you think needs or you want to have a new form!

The best places to protest would be at game stores. GameStop is your best bet.

The second best would be in an area with lots of people. Like parks, conventions(mostly pokemon and anime ones. Including E3 and the Nintendo Store. When game freak announces a new game, is is when you all give them hell.), etc.

You all should continuously do them to show how outraged you all are with every single flaw in the game.

But, there is a clear difference between playing the rival and getting your starter in Platinum versus Shield. I enjoy Shield as a stand alone, but this is not currently better... does this feeling change, can I expect improvements beyond it being 3D?|yogabbagabbayoself|False|https://redd.it/ek7yyt|1|0.54|0|6|1|pokemon

ejwzj8|2020-01-04 14:04:54|Pokeball ideas.|"**Aero-ball:** The higher the speed stat the better the catch rate is.

**Sturdy-ball:** The higher the defense stat the better the catch rate is.

**Gold-Ball:** which serves no purpose but to show off.

**Pokeball Transfer:** In Pokemon Centers there could be a machine that if you select a Pokemon and  the ball you wanna use it switches the ball but breaks the previous ball (no infinite master balls for you rip.)

**Bringing back Apricorns:** It'd be great if the next region has Apricorns, very unlikely."|TapWaterYum|False|https://redd.it/ejwzj8|13|0.76|0|3|1|pokemon

I‚Äôve never been into breeding or competitive. .. until now. I had no idea how much of a side game breeding was and I can‚Äôt seem to get enough of it. 

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve bred so far and I‚Äôm trying to build a solid six man team. Any and all help would be much appreciated!

Tyranitar 

Mimikyu

Dragapult

Darmanitan

Corviknight 

Dracovish

Gyarados 

Hydreigon

Toxtricity

Grimmsnarl 

Which six would be ideal as a team? Or should I look for 1-2 more Pok√©mon to help round out the selection?

Thank you for all advice and tips!

ejtu4b|2020-01-04 07:58:07|Link trade sucks|Compared to the GTS, link trade sucks ass. With the GTS you'd put a Pok√©mon up for trade and say what Pok√©mon you want in return and eventually you'd get that Pok√©mon if you were lucky. With link trade it's a shitty game of cat and mouse, trying to figure out what the other person wants while also praying they figure out what you want as well. Link trade would be better if you could at least specify what pokemon you want. Sure GTS had it's problems (mainly people asking for level 1-10 3rd stage Pok√©mon or unobtainable legendaries) but other than that it worked just fine. Another thing that sucks is if you're looking for a specific Pok√©mon you can't just go browse the listings for it, you have to either use the clusterfuck that is the link trade system or you have to surprise trade a box full of fucking skwovets hoping you eventually get the Pok√©mon you want but it never happens because nobody is dumb enough to put that specific Pok√©mon up for surprise trade because they know they're gonna get a skwovet or some other route 1 pokemon. Sorry for the long rant but jfc this new trading system is frustrating if you're actually looking for a specific Pok√©mon to complete your Pok√©dex|YangsterSupreme|False|https://redd.it/ejtu4b|34|0.9|0|11|1|pokemon
