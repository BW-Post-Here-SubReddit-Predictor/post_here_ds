ejdi50|2020-01-03 10:09:53|Are our phones always listening?|"So, this question has been asked more than a few times. I clicked through some and read the answers on those other threads but the overwhelming answer is no, they do not. And the ads you get you probably.searched for one way or another.

Well I wanted to post because a few weeks ago I was joking about putting my mother in a nursing home. She doesn't actually need to be in one, and I've never searched for nursing homes. We don't even live in the same area. I got ads a few hours later for nursing homes in my area. 

That still didn't convince me 100%, I'm not sure why but I questioned my sanity. Maybe I'm making things up and I didn't really make that joke lol. I did but you get the point. 

So earlier tonight, I work in a hospital. I walked out to my car and an uber pulled up in front of the ER to pick up a patient. The patient walked out and said ""hey are you uber? I have to fit my wheelchair in the back"" I was about 5 feet from the guy. Phone was in my hand. I thought how is that guy going to fit his wheelchair in that car lol.

Well, a few hours later I have an add on my phone for wheelchair accessible uber's. I do not use uber, and I don't have a wheelchair or search anything wheelchair related on the interwebz. 

There is absolutely no way our phones do not listen to us and analyze for add words in real time. Do people still disagree? Am I crazy?"|Plsblowme14|False|https://redd.it/ejdi50|8|0.57|0|43|1|technology

I'm purposefully deleting / deactivating all social media as a way to force me out in to the real world to meet new people. I've been going through a lot of big life changes lately and this just feels right.

But I'm definitely addicted. I have the addictive personality gene. Recovering alcoholic to boot. I know how to abuse things.

So to everyone out there who doesn't use social media in their life — what advice can you give me or anyone else reading this to go live a fulfilled life? I've pretty much kicked everything cold turkey just fine but mannn I am addicted to instagram.
