ekkw6v|2020-01-05 23:24:08|"For seven years, I've been developing a spiritual successor to Minecraft and MMORPGs, called ""Lost Existence"". It launched recently on Steam. AMA!"|"###Introduction

Hey Reddit! I'm Sean Egan, lead developer for the small indie game studio ""Lurid Spectre Games"". For the last seven years, we've been creating the First-Person Voxel Action-RPG ""Lost Existence"" in Java. We launched the game on Steam in Early Access on November 21st.

You can view the store page, trailers, and more information about the game here:

[STORE/TRAILERS/INFO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1129730/Lost_Existence/)

------------------

###What is Lost Existence?

Lost Existence is a game about exploring an ancient planet full of ruins and secrets, fighting for survival, and forging your own unique character class. It also features incredibly smooth multiplayer, optional pvp teams, and support for player-made dungeons.

Lost Existence is run in its own original engine based in Java and supported by LWJGL. All code and engines are new, it is not a mod.

------------------

###About Us

I've been working alongside Scott Rogers, who made all of the graphical assets, and Sam Gossner, who created all of the sound. I also have to thank our dozen or so alpha testers, we couldn't have done it without them.

My work consists of all of the game design and coding, as well as creating the background systems to support the content. For the entire duration of development, and even up to this day, I've been working full time refining the engine and fixing bugs; it's an endless job.

ekwboc|2020-01-06 16:25:07|We are The Hosts From Live Rescue, Matt Iseman, Capt. Garon Mosby of St. Louis FD and Paramedic ＆ Nurse Dan Flynn, Ask Us Anything!|"Hosted by Matt Iseman with analysis from Captain Garon Mosby of the St. Louis Fire Department and Dan Flynn, a Registered Paramedic and Registered Nurse, “Live Rescue” airs on A＆E on Monday nights at 9pm ET/PT.  “Live Rescue” follows America’s first responders as they bravely put their lives on the line answering emergency rescue calls across the country.  Tonight at 9PM is the premiere of season 2 which will have a commercial free hour. 

Matt Iseman is Host of A＆E’s live documentary series, “Live Rescue.”  He is perhaps best known as the host of the four time Emmy-nominated “American Ninja Warrior.”  The Boston Globe has said of him, “The best part about American Ninja Warrior, hands down, is when bro-host Matt Iseman roars the show’s title.” He also helms the latest spinoff, American Ninja Warrior Junior, on Universal Kids (it’s their highest rated show ever) and he headed up the spinoff, “ANW: Ninja vs. Ninja” on the USA Network. Matt hosted Evel Live  and Evel Live 2 on History, the highest rated cable specials of 2018  and 2019 respectively, and makes regular visits to the Today Show.  He is a licensed physician with a medical degree from Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.  “Life is short, do what makes you happy.” That’s the advice that Matt got from his Dad, a world renowned physician, when Matt quit medicine to pursue stand up comedy. 

Garon Mosby has twenty-five years of service to the citizens of St. Louis City: twenty years with the St. Louis Fire Department and five years with the St. Louis Police Department. Mosby currently serves as the Captain and Public information Officer. In addition to serving as the traditional liaison between the media and the fire service, Captain Mosby proactively utilizes various social media platforms to create a direct portal from the fire service to the stakeholder, thereby creating the ultimate vision of transparency.  Captain Mosby also mentors at Peabody Elementary. He serves on the Board of the Missouri Critical Incident Stress Management Team, the Communication Board for the St. Louis American Red Cross, and is the Public Information Officer for the International Association Of Black Professional Firefighters.

Dan Flynn is a Nationally Registered Paramedic and Registered Nurse in New Orleans, Louisiana.  He has been working in the Emergency Medical Services since 2001, starting in a Fire-based service in Mandeville, LA working as a Firefighter/Paramedic. He joined New Orleans EMS in 2003 and remains a current active employee as a Field Training Officer.  Dan holds multiple other certifications, including NRP, ACLS, PALS, and HAZMAT Technician. He is a member of NAEMT and the Emergency Nursing Association. His career achievements include working as a Paramedic/Firefighter during and following Hurricane Katrina.  He was featured on the A＆E documentary series, “Nightwatch,” and the A＆E digital series, “First Responders.”

ejz5l4|2020-01-04 17:04:17|I am a self taught app developer, who learned through coding a little bit everyday for the last three years. Today I am launching my first application to help others do the same. AMA|"Hi my name is Shing So and I have been following a No Zero Days mentality for the last three years and have taught myself how to develop phone apps. [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/Aaj75R7)

**Background**

Three years ago I ran into a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) about a system called No Zero Days. The idea was to do something everyday, no matter the size, towards your goal. No having much direction or knowledge, I decided that I wanted to learn how to code. When I first started I bought a online course and tackled one video lesson a day. Starting off, I learned very slowly. I took several beginner coding courses as I wasn't picking up a lot of the key concepts. Eventually I went towards application development and began coding, 1-2 hours, on simple applications everyday.

A big leap forward in my learning journey came from another reddit post, which talked about Learning How to Learn. Learning How To Learn gave insight on why I procrastinated so much.  After applying several of the methods learned for learning, I was understanding material much quicker. Through applying these learning methods, I learned how to use AWS and deployed my own servers so I could utilize a backend for my apps. Learning How to Learn is a free course on which you can find [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).

**What have I learned?**

The most important lesson that I have learned through my journey is that difficult problems and concepts generally take more than one look to solve or understand. A tendency that I used to have was to give up at the first sign of difficultly. Its scary when something doesn't click in your head and you have to face the idea that maybe you never under figure it out.

There were many times when I was developing an application where I would run into a problem I thought was impossible for me to solve. I would be dealing with the same problem for weeks, not making any progress towards a solution. Although there were many times I doubted my own ability to solve a problem, there wasn't a single time were a didn't eventually find a solution.

Another lesson is that habits work better than motivation. Motivation is very good at burst of actions but don't really help when times get difficult. Achieving goals and getting good at something requires consistent action and a long term commitment. Habits take between three month to a year to form depending on what you are to do. I believe that building good habits is the best investment you can make.

Also when starting something new, it's best to take slow small steps. It's more important to form long term habits than to go hard and eventually give up.

**Whats the app?**

The application I am launching today is called Steps - Action Inspires. It's a social media application crossed between a habit tracker. You set Todos, which is an action you plan to do consistently throughout the week. Whenever you complete a Todo, it shows up on your followers feeds. Your media feed is comprised of actions of the people you follow.

Tracking your progress is crucial when you attempting something new and challenging . A huge motivating factor for me was seeing the growth and improvement I was making. I believe that by seeing what others are doing towards their goals and the effort it takes to become successful is inspirational and provides additional motivation

**Moving Forward**

As coding everyday is a strong habit of mine, I will continue to work on coding and improving Steps everyday. There are still many aspects which will be improved on such as design. You can follow me on my app, my username is im\_so\_shing. I'll definitely follow you back as I am excited to see the progress and actions people will take.

I've made a simple website to showcase the application at [stepsactioninspires.com](https://stepsactioninspires.com) and if you would like to start your Steps today you can download it on [IOS (apple store page)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steps-action-inspires/id1491714172?ls=1) and [Android (google play page)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stepsdebugv2)

EDIT: There are currently some issues on typing on some IOS phones. I will be looking into these issues as well as implementing a way to delete Todos shortly. 

EDIT: I have deployed a patch for IOS and Android which fixed several bugs which should be active on 1/6

EDIT: Thank you all taking interest my my journey and application. I will check this thread in awhile for any remaining questions, but I will no longer be actively answering questions. Thank you all again!"|NoImNotJustAsian|False|https://redd.it/ejz5l4|7653|0.84|5|386|1|iama

I take charge of the cannabis  advertisers of TrafficJunky--that being said, any ad regarding cannabis  to be put on these sites goes through me, in countries such as Canada, USA, UK and EU!

 What's awesome about advertising on adult sites is that it covers a very large audience without being restricted. **Especially when you want to advertise cannabis related products.**

I don't have many physical abilities anymore. I'm also a YouTuber and Graphic Design student. Please AMA!|"Hey everyone!

Some of you may remember the AMA I did a little over a year ago. I got an overwhelming response last time so I thought it was time I did another one.

If you don’t, I was born with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and have dealt with many things related to it. Most people don't feel comfortable asking about disabilities even though they might be curious and just assume things. As I'm getting older, I've been advocating and informing a lot. My goal is to leave a lasting impact and I hope someone will learn something new from this.

Some background about me:

* I lost the ability to walk about 14 years ago when I was 9.
* I really have no arm strength. Just enough hand and wrist strength to control my power wheelchair and use a computer mouse and use a customized PS4 controller.
* I have lost a cousin and uncle to DMD.
* I use Non-invasive ventilation which is using a ventilator to take deeper breathes using a mouthpiece during the day as needed and a mask at night
* Started a YouTube channel about 1 1/2 years about different adaptions in my life and things I enjoy. [https://www.youtube.com/c/MilanPatel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MilanPatel)
* I have developed a photography hobby in the last year.

ejmp7u|2020-01-03 22:12:44|I breed pigeons that are bred and trained to steal other pigeons. AMA|"Posted this in /r/ama yesterday, but thought maybe I'd get more traction here, if anyone was interested. Example of one of my thief pouters [here](https://v.redd.it/b2pt9v0cbe841).

Little background: Thief pouters have been around for centuries. In the beginning, they were used to steal racing pigeons from others as the birds returned home. 

This practice was eventually outlawed, naturally, since no one likes having their stuff stolen. That's when thief breeders turned on each other and started (sometimes not so) friendly competitions to see who could capture whose birds. If someone else's thief caught your thief, they got to keep it. Those are the rules of the game.

As the hobby spread out to other countries/continents, there were fewer people to compete with, so breeders started practicing what is called ""zuritero"" - which is where they compete to see who can catch the most feral pigeons. 

While catching ferals lacks some of the excitement of trying to steal other thieves, it does present its own challenges. Ferals are much more wary of people and pigeon lofts than a domestic pigeon would be, so it can be hard for the thieves to actually lure them into the loft. 

AMA about pigeons, thief pouters, or whatever you want to ask me - related or not.

Edit: [Here's](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2017/06/doo-pigeons-flying-scotland/) an article National Geographic did on the hobby in Scotland. It's pretty big over there.

Edit x3: It's late now, the questions are slowing down, and the wife is demanding I get off this ole machine and pay her some attention.

Although our backgrounds and experiences all differ greatly, many of us were former employees from the largest debt settlement/debt relief companies around today. We grew tired of seeing people burdened by credit card debt being taking advantage of so we formed what is now The Debt Relief Company. Some of us are former certified financial advisors, experts in mortgage modifications, financial consultants, negotiation specialists, financial planners, etc. We are all qualified financial consultants and we all have a tremendous amount of experience helping people burdened with credit card debt and unsecured debt. Not to sound overly altruistic but we formed out of a desire to provide Americans with legitimate and honest help and provide free financial advice whenever possible. We charge no up-front fees and most of the time we postpone client fees for months to years so long as it helps their bottom-line and helps them get their life back on track. We like to think that customer service and people come first, not profits. The inspiration and idea for our company came about over a decade ago during the financial crisis when our co-founders began helping an aunt with a debt negotiation plan and another family member with a mortgage modification.

Many of our clients today have been carrying credit card debt for quite some time and we created this AMA today to help people avoid needing our services in the future (as crazy as that may sound). We constantly receive questions like “I wish I knew more about debt and credit before opening all these accounts”, “How exactly does interest work?”, or “I got a summons, what do I do now?”.

We pride ourselves on being able to educate and empower our clients with financial know-how but also have a desire to provide financial literacy for the general public in the US. 

Feel free to ask us anything related to debt, credit, interest, budgeting, financial planning, etc.

I am a husband, father, Marine Veteran, teacher, business consultant, host of The Sharpe Way Show, and 2018 Libertarian Candidate for Governor of NY.

During my campaign, I held over 300 live, public events, including at least one in each of New York's 62 counties (a #fullsharpe). In 2019, I completed another #fullsharpe, of over 100 live, public events, including at least one in each of New York's 62 counties. People ask me often why I am spending this much of my personal time meeting and talking with voters across New York State, even when I'm not running for office. It's because it still matters. In fact the longer we remain in highest in the nation for all the wrong reasons, the more liberty concepts and innovative ideas to solve problems matter.

I am looking forward to answering your questions today. During the campaign, our conversations focused mostly on topics specific to New Yorkers, including repealing the SAFE Act, innovative education options, eliminating the state income tax, facilitating innovative non-taxpayer funding, eliminating tolls, localizing more government decisions, transparent government, relieving over-regulated farmers, saving Main Street, criminal justice reform, family court reform, supporting newer industries that NYS is crushing, and stopping the population exodus from NY.

Since the election, conversations often cover topics affecting the nation or the world. In all cases, the goal is to change the culture of governance from one of bribery and punishment to one of innovation and choices.

ej5wwp|2020-01-02 22:59:51|I am a 92 year old German born Jew who grew up in the Hitler youth and was forced to fight in WW2 in the German anti-tank division. I deserted and became a POW in a British camp and eventually moved to Canada in 1955. Just recently, I published a memoir of my life. AMA|"I was born in 1927 in Herne, Germany. To quote from my memoir, ""I am a survivor of Nazi Germany during WW2. During my childhood I had to live 2 lives: a false public one as a loyal Nazi and my true one at home as a Jewish child in an anti-fascist family."" Though both of my legal parents were German citizens, by biological father was Jewish. My family was always very open and accepting of others, and did not support fascism (but did what they needed to to survive). During WW2, we kept my heritage a secret. As a result, I was raised in the Hitler youth and trained as an anti-aircraft soldier. I was quite tall and desirable to the SS, but I had no interest in becoming one of them, so I volunteered to be in the anti-tank division once I was old enough to enlist.

Though I fought as a German, I never believed in the war and waited for an opportunity to desert. When I was 17 a group of like-minded soldiers and I deserted and became POW in a British camp for 7 months.

When the war ended, I returned to the secret family business of smuggling. The economic depression post-WW2 created an opportunity for my family to make money by illegally importing goods from surrounding countries (e.g. women's stockings from France). During this time I married my wife and had my first daughter.

In 1955, my wife, daughter, and I moved to Montreal, Canada. I worked any job I could get, including work as a butcher (even though I was not trained as one), a gas station attendant, and a candy maker. In 1958 we moved to Thunder Bay where I worked in a factory, then as a logger. There I had 3 more children.

My family and I eventually moved to Thompson, Manitoba so I could work in the mine. We had a good standard of living there (my wife was quite happy). We had a brand new home and plenty of extra income, but I saw no future for my children there. I lied to my wife, saying I had secured a job at the Britannia Beach mine and moved the entire family across Canada to Squamish, BC. I did end up getting a job in the mine, where I worked for a few months (until they went on strike). After that I worked in a pulp and paper mill (Woodfibre) for 25 years until my retirement.

My wife passed away from cancer in 2001. Since then I have traveled extensively, remarried, and am living happily in BC. I recently wrote a book about my life and you can find it here: [https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr\_1\_4?keywords=fearless&qid=1578004297&sr=8-4](https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=fearless&qid=1578004297&sr=8-4)

Hello Reddit, I am Roberts grand-daughter. I will be helping him with this post, by asking him your questions and writing his responses. He would like to add that this post makes it sound like his life was a lot more smooth and pre-planned than it was. His life was a lot more 'by the seat of his pants' than this suggests.

Below we have attached some photos from his life

\*\*\* EDIT\*\*\*

Hello everyone, thanks for the overwhelming amount of responses. We are going to stop answering questions for now but we might try and answer some of the bigger ones in the next couple days, when I (grand-daughter) am able to get together with Robert again.

Also, to people wondering how someone who had a Jewish father, who was killed for being a Jew, could be alive (since the Germans would have killed the whole family). Simply put, Robert's biological father and legal father are two different people. His biological father was one of his neighbors and worked as a sales manager for the family.  Robert found out at 4 years old, but he was still raised to be his legal father's son."|fearless1927|False|https://redd.it/ej5wwp|70876|0.86|53|3891|1|iama

ejqbzg|2020-01-04 02:41:40|IAmAdora Bautista, an anonymous sex worker and amateur porn performer. AMA!|"Hey there, /r/IAmA! I go by Adora Bautista, and began my sex work career in 2011 when I was 19, after a friend convinced me to go work in a strip club to make some money for college. From there, **I forayed into camming, phone sex operating, panty selling, and more, all the while, hiding this part of my life from most of the people I know, especially my family.** Nowadays, I’m working on building my income through clip selling (ManyVids, Clips4Sale, Modelhub, etc.) and offering fan club subscriptions, currently through OnlyFans and AVN Stars. To help customers and lurkers sift through the content and services I offer, I just created a [new website](https://adorabautista.com). And I also have a [blog](https://blog.adorabautista.com)! It’s pretty bare-bones now, but I’m hoping it will appeal to many people, including fellow performers, customers, and especially for those curious about the industry.

I also have experience with sugaring and escorting (under a different name), although I am transitioning out of those. However, I’m still working those hustles (plus stripping) because they’re good for short-term income and I’m saving up to start a few businesses and nonprofits whose missions are near-and-dear to my heart - where my true passions lie.

So...now that you know a little bit about my adult career, what about my work, life, passions, etc. are you curious about? Ask Me Anything!

**TL;DR:** Started stripping in 2011, and have since gone into camming, phone sex, operating, panty selling, etc. Mostly work on selling clips and fan club subscriptions now. New website and blog up. Transitioning out of escorting, sugaring, and stripping, but still work those for short-term income and to save up for my true passions: starting businesses and nonprofits. All of this is being done without most of the people in my life, especially family, knowing. AMA!

ehupr3|2019-12-31 00:15:50|I'm a thin 24 year old and I recently had a heart attack. AMA|"I was closing up for work around 8:30 Saturday after scarfing down some Chinese food to the point I was stuffed beyond belief, that was about 10 minutes prior. As I was closing I started feeling a tight pain in my chest but it was towards my throat in the middle not the left side so I figured I ate too much (I'm prone to heartburn so I thought this was my first case of bad indigestion). I finished my close and served a few people while trying to act like I wasn't in any pain (as I figured it was my own fault and nothing serious). 9pm rolls by (closing) and I get my Uber and as soon as I sit down in it my arm goes numb and I start sweating, now I'm starting to get nervous and google heart attack symptoms. I get home about 9:15 and spend the next 20 minutes asking my friends if they think I could be having a heart attack and what they'd do and all just kinda laugh and say probably not but if you're worried go get it checked. So I called Telehealth (Canadian health line you should use for non serious conditions before wasting the hospital's time) and explained what happened and now this person is telling me I need to go NOW so Im kinda freaking now and call an Uber to the emergency. I get their to a completely packed waiting room and almost decide to turn around and go home (almost a huge mistake) but a friend tells me I should do it since I'm already there and leave if they don't think it's anything at the check in.so they hook me up to some wires for a chest scan which doesn't show anything and they do a blood test. Another half hour or so goes by its around 11ish and they tell me they need to redo the test and this time lead me back to the observation, now I'm really freaked because this is a step before being admitted. They continue to do blood tests every 2 hours and around 3:30 they come in and tell me I'm not going to be able to leave as I did in fact have a heart attack. As of now I'm in the hospital just waiting for an appointment at a heart institute.

Tldr: I thought I was having a heart attack and almost didn't go, and I was. Always go get checked with strange chest pain.


Edit: the doctor at the heart institute thinks he sees something in the tests sent over everyone else didn't and has cancelled the angiogram to do other tests. Here's hoping he's right, he thinks it's some sort of carditis.


Edit 2: The doctor at the heart institute thought it was a virus, but then his tests didn't show a virus so they did the original test and that showed nothing so they're just guessing it is a virus. I can't afford to sit in the hospital any longer and they aren't running any more tests so I'm discharging myself so I can get back to work tomorrow. Hopefully it doesn't happen again?

It was 2012 and we wanted to have a worthwhile New Year's Eve with our friends, so we've put together a few questions that would help us focus. The event was an absolute success, our idea resonated really well with others. We thought that this could be something useful and decided to make a booklet. Next year we made it public on the internet. We thought maybe we would have a couple hundred downloads and make a few people happy. Next thing we know – it went viral. Today the YearCompass booklet is available in 39 different languages (translated by volunteers) and had 1.200.000 downloads last year.

We believe in self-awareness. Self-recognition is one of the key things to become a better human – and we need a lot of awesome humans on this planet. The path is not easy and we enjoy helping anyone who needs help, this is why we created the booklet and the YearCompass movement.

I'm an American cop who is on a SWAT team. Prior to being a cop, I worked for an airline and prior to that I was in the Air Force.

I have been streaming on the internet for close to a decade. I started with streaming Pokemon Red and seeing how far I could get in the game without using a PokeCenter. I have since modernized and stream on Twitch at [Twitch.tv/pdchampagne](https://Twitch.tv/pdchampagne)where I play mostly FPS and MOBA games.

I am doing this AMA for a couple reasons. I'll start with the self serving one;

From now until June I am fundraising for the [Special Olympics](https://www.specialolympics.org/). All money my [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/pdchampagne)generates for the next 6 months will be donated and I will match the first $500.00

I run in the Special Olympics Torch Run every year and do fundraising until the actual run. I raised close to $1000.00 last year. If you want to donate directly, follow the Special Olympics link above. [Charitynavigator.org](https://Charitynavigator.org) gives the Special Olympics charity 90/100 overall as a reliable charity.

The second reason is I have seen an uptick in ""swatting"" calls. I know this happened a few years ago and I figured since it's happening again, I might be able to shed some light.

Feel free to ask my anything!

PROOF: I am verified on [r/LEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/LEO/). I've uploaded [this picture](https://imgur.com/2JewWqa), and you can cross-reference that with my Twitch! If mods need additional proof I'm a cop (which I hope they don't since I already sent my credentials on r/LEO) I can provide that as well.

I get asked fairly regularly on Reddit for advice on how best to get started, so I figure an AMA is as good an opportunity to clear up as many misconceptions as possible and collect all the advice I've got to give in one place for anyone who thinks it might be something they're interested in -- either as a potential career, or just as a hobby.

On account of it being my cakeday -- and because would it *really* be an AMA if I wasn't shilling something? -- I've released three of my books for free for the next five days:

* [***Reckless***](https://www.amazon.com/Reckless-Bad-Boy-Musicians-Novel-ebook/dp/B07CF8667D) is a novel about a Texas diner owner whose ex-boyfriend rolls back into town after a decade away -- now a famous musician, and eager to rekindle their romance.

* [***Smooth***](https://www.amazon.com/Smooth-Love-Romance-Novel-Musicians-ebook/dp/B07MNXK4TG/) is a novel about an uptight Chicago lawyer who, newly single after a break up with her fiancé, finds herself in New Orleans for her best friend's wedding -- only to find herself repeatedly crossing paths with a freewheeling jazz musician.

* [***Love at Christmas***](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Christmas-Four-Holiday-Romances-ebook/dp/B082FJ43V9/) is a collection of novellas about four single sisters who find a little Christmas romance waiting for them under the tree. (Not with each other, you perverts. With other people.) It's a soft little slice of festive romance.

You can also check out my website, [**HazelRedgate.com**](https://hazelredgate.com), where I release short erotica and romance for free, twice a week. (I also have [**a Patreon**](https://patreon.com/HazelRedgate), if that's your bag, or you can find me at [my subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/Portarossa).)

If there's anything you want to know about writing for a living, writing *smut* for a living, how to make your dialogue -- or your dirty talk -- really pop, what the deal is with airline food, how to go about getting your stuff noticed, what *Star Wars* has to do with structuring romantic fiction, or literally *anything else*, fire away!

In Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, a game I currently cannot touch, theres a section of Kashyyyk (the Shadowlands) full of plants that cannot be killed but can kill you. I absolutely hate it, it's my absolute worst nightmare. I'm waiting for a friend to come over and get me past it so I can continue.

eerw8i|2019-12-23 22:43:36|I’m Debra Meyerson, a stroke survivor. At age 53 I nearly lost my life, and did lose my speech, use of my right arm, and my professorship at Stanford. I began to ask, “Who am I now?” I’m here to talk about the psychological and emotional journey of rebuilding a rewarding life after trauma. AMA|"Hi All! I'm Debra Meyerson, a stroke survivor that is thrilled to be alive after a massive stroke in 2010. I want to share what I have learned over the last 9 years about the often forgotten emotional and psychological piece of recovering from traumatic injury such as stroke. My story is about stroke, but these lessons apply to other traumatic injury, life threatening illness, or even just adjusting to retirement or old age.

In 2010, I was a Stanford Professor, athlete, and mother to three. Then I had two strokes that nearly killed me and left me, even after three years of almost full time therapy, with significant speech and physical disabilities. Since then my life has been very different! I read every book I could get my hands on about how to physically recover from stroke. But none of them helped me understand how to cope with the emotional issues associated with my reduced capabilities. I didn't know who I was after my personal and professional life was so thoroughly upended. 

I wrote Identity Theft: Rediscovering Ourselves After Stroke to help those who have suffered from stroke handle the emotional trauma more gracefully. AMA!

Ask me anything!|"Hey, I’m Nick Thieme of the Atlanta Journal Constitution’s data team.

I used data from publicly available voter registration lists provided by the Georgia Secretary of State, economic data released by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Georgia General Assembly’s digital maps of voting precincts to estimate the number of people who didn't vote because of their distance to their polling place.

I looked at data before and after the Supreme Court’s Shelby v. Holder decision (which gutted an important part of the Voting Rights Act, protecting minorities in certain primarily Southern states from discriminatory electoral changes), finding that distance didn't really play a part before the decision, but played a large part after.

As Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in her dissenting opinion in that case, “throwing out preclearance \[the Voting Rights Act section ruled unconstitutional\] when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.” Our analysis measures the force of the rain.

ecupsk|2019-12-19 15:30:45|Less than 30% of CBD products are accurately labeled. IAMA neuroscientist using third party, independent lab testing to find high-quality CBD products. Let’s chat about what CBD is good for, what it’s not good for, and everything in between. AMA.|"What is CBD? Will CBD get me high? Is CBD addictive? How much CBD do I take? What is CBD good for? I answer these questions among others every day.

The CBD market has exploded. With the CBD boom, snake oil merchants armed with misinformation and lack of regulation have saturated the market of the popular cannabinoid. It can be confusing or even scary for people to find legitimate information and products. Not everyone knows that there are a lot of poor quality CBD products in the market. [A 2017 study published in JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2661569) suggests only about 30% of CBD products are labeled accurately. We have done our own 3rd party blind testing on close to 400 products and only about 20% have been labeled accurately, meaning they failed for being within 10%+/- of the labeled amount of cannabinoids, had ingredients they shouldn’t have, or didn’t have ingredients they claimed to have. 

Some people know a lot about CBD and other related compounds, but there are many people who still have basic questions. After presenting and getting some great questions during a CBD panel at the [AZ Plant Medicine Conference](https://plantmedicineconference.com/austin-flohrschutz/), we thought we could share in the holiday spirit of giving to disseminate quality information to the community. **I am Austin Flohrschutz AMA about CBD!**

**My education**: BS in Behavioral Neuroscience and MS in Neuroscience (recently decided to leave a PhD program in Neuroscience with an MS degree to become Director of Science for a science-led CBD company). As an undergraduate, I worked in a medicinal chemistry lab focused on extracting biologically active compounds from plants (Salvia divinorum), which were then purified and used to synthesize new potential drugs to treat pain without addictive properties. While in graduate school I worked in a neuropharmacology lab focused on pain, opioids, addiction, and cannabinoids. At my current organization we formed a board of some pre-eminent cannabinoid researchers who sit on our Science Advisory Board that I collaborate with, including:

**Todd Vanderah**, PhD in Pharmacology - Head and Professor of Pharmacology, and is a Professor in the Departments of Neurology and Anesthesiology at The University of Arizona, College of Medicine. His research interests include mechanisms of cancer pain, neuronal integration in pain pathways, neurochemical release during conditions of neuropathy, neuronal plasticity, addiction, cannabinoid & opioid receptor pharmacology, as well as the discovery of novel targets for new medications.

**Adam Friedman**, MD, FAAD is Professor and Interim Chair of Dermatology and serves as Residency Program Director, Director of Translational Research, and Director of the Supportive Oncodermatology Program in the Department of Dermatology at The George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences. Dr. Friedman is investigating novel nanotechnologies that allow for advanced delivery of a wide spectrum of medicinally relevant molecules, such as cannabinoids, with an emphasis on treating infectious diseases, accelerating wound healing, immune modulation, and correcting vascular dysfunction.

**Dr. Hope Jones** is Chief Scientific Officer of Emergent Cannabis Sciences -- an advising company driving scientific innovation within the cannabis industry -- and CEO and founder of Adivina Crop Science -- offering state of the art cannabis tissue culture and micropropagation services. Dr. Jones' previously worked as a Staff Scientist for NASA’s Life Sciences and Biosystems Engineering Program, where she was responsible for micropropagation production of crops, phytochemical research, and developing growing system technologies for deep space missions. 

Note: Our science advisory board is currently busy today with work and teaching, so they will help answer questions over the next 24 hours or so through this shared account.

The company I work for is called [TruPotency.com](https://www.trupotency.com/). I and the other science advisors joined this company because we’re philosophically aligned with their mission of blind 3rd party testing every product to ensure they’re properly labeled and safe for use. We also upload our lab results to every product page. Lastly, we display cannabinoid and terpene profiles on every product page in an easy way to digest. We sincerely hope you find this useful.

&#x200B;

Hello y'all, I'm a Taiwanese-Canadian with many interests, as seen in the title, in which I will now elaborate upon. :)

&#x200B;

**Instrument Maker:**

I specialize in making indigenous Taiwanese instruments, but I have also done some experimentation with other instruments from first-nations around the world. If you want so see some here's a [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa7fGThqnS_WdTdYPqUuHnb-EfzK48Qhf) (note: this does not include all the instruments I've made).

**Choral Singer:**

Proud singer in \[not gonna give away location that easily\], where I sing Bass (fun fact: a while back we got to sing on stage with [Dodie Clark](https://youtu.be/tyMfKuw0IQM)). I also sing in my school's concert choir & chamber choir where I sing Tenor.

**Instrumentalist:**

I'm a player of all of the aforementioned indigenous Taiwanese instruments, but I also play piano, oboe, ukulele, and I've also began to [learn guitar](https://youtu.be/-fAvs9HRS0M).

**Bowyer & Archer:**

I have 3 years of bow making experience (I've also in the past made atlatls), having made many bows out of bamboo, cedar, willow, and vine maple. I've just begun practicing shooting in the [style of the Siraya](https://youtu.be/epWc-4CT6EA) tribe from ancient times.

**Trapper:**

I've learned to build many [Indigenous Taiwanese traps](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa7fGThqnS_XCflzhXiik0mbNNMYaQND_) in order to catch the rats that eat crops from our garden.

**Beginner Songwriter:**

I've just begun to write my own songs, both in the Siraya language and English, so far I've not recorded any of the English songs I've written, but I have written a song in the Siraya language that we performed in school concert choir (I'm not allowed to upload that performance but I did a recording of the song while sick and stuck in my room [here](https://youtu.be/rbJrsXagjlg)).

**Siraya Language Student:**

I'm currently learning the Siraya language, an indigenous Taiwanese language that had been extinct for about 100 years, and has just recently been brought back from old texts left behind by the Dutch.

I’m also co-editor in chief of [Social History of Alcohol and Drugs: An Interdisciplinary Journal](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/shad/pr/180921) and author of a new book with the MIT Press called “[Break On Through](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262042827/),” which draws on archives and government documents, medical journals, and interviews, and interweaves references to pop (counter)culture to historicize the radical mental health practices in the 1960s and 70s. I published another book (“[Strange Trips](https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Trips-Regulation-McGill-Queens-Associated/dp/0773556370)”) earlier this year that focuses on the contentious relationship between scientific knowledge, cultural assumptions, and social concerns. My hope — particularly with “Break On Through” — is to promote the discussion of mental health by placing the histories of American mental health, pharmaceutical use, and intoxicant use in dialogue with one another, all within the context of mainstream and fringe therapies.

Over the past few years, I've written and taught about how and why we control and regulate drugs in CANADA and the US. And I've tried to understand the major swings and struggles in modern mental health care. I’m here from 1 – 3 PM EST — ask me anything! (if you can’t make it then, you can find me on Twitter [@LucRichert](https://twitter.com/lucrichert) and [@drughistory](https://twitter.com/drughistory).)

We are South Florida Sun Sentinel reporters. In the aftermath of Parkland, we’ve been investigating dangerous kids in Florida’s classrooms. Over the past 18 months, we discovered 100 court cases with chilling details of disturbed kids making deadly threats against teachers and classmates. Our reporting found that these emotionally disturbed children often have easy access to guns at home and are protected by state and federal disability laws. Ask us anything about today’s schools and a generation of children at risk.

Please take some time to read our stories.

I'm a self-taught gourmet chef and have been serving 6 to 16 - course dinners with courses that include things like:

* Chocolate mousse
* Pavlova
* Mentholated watermelon
* Beet and carrot meringue
* Potato fondant
* our distinctive caviar service
* and another 100 or so different dishes.

If I had to guess, I'd say we have had over 5,000 guests so far at the dinners.

What makes this dinner ""erotic"" is the interactive experience that guests enjoy. Not only do our playful, masked staff serve the food, they also tantalize the guests via flirting, light touch, and removal of clothing. All of our play remains above the waist, but guests leave with an unforgettable experience

The incumbent Republican received less than two-thirds of ballots cast, in a district where Stacey Abrams won by a significant margin.

I stepped up to run as an emergency write-in candidate, to ensure that the voters had a choice - after the democratic candidate ( unexpectedly) chose not file for the seat. I am running to ensure that our community has a representative that reflects its values, and will focus on the needs of the people.

I’m a 36- year-old mother of two children, and a mental health/addiction recovery specialist, who previously worked as a legislative coordinator and human rights lobbyist. I used my leadership role in a well-known progressive organization to secure a national focus on Gwinnett County’s state and local electoral races. I’m currently a leader in the Gwinnett County Democratic Party.

Georgia Republicans, including the incumbent Representative, continue to pursue a divisive and harmful path for our state and for Snellville, such as the six-week abortion ban.https://patch.com/georgia/snellville/candidate-leslie-condemns-brian-kemp-s-signing-hb-481 I will work to pass legislation that explicitly prohibits racial profiling by state, county, and local law enforcement agencies.

I will continue to advocate for people living with disabilities as well as healthcare for every Georgian and enhanced mental health and addiction recovery services. Peer-Run facilities need to have a presence in every city in Georgia. I support investing in transportation and infrastructure, including mass transit. I believe in strengthening our economy for the working and middle class, common sense gun reform, legalizing marijuana, clean energy--and voter protection and voting rights reforms that will ensure Georgians can have confidence in our elections.

We recently published two reports ([here](https://www.tampabay.com/special-reports/2019/12/08/an-autistic-child-melts-down-an-officer-makes-a-decision-a-family-suffers-the-consequences/) and [here](https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2019/12/10/floridas-flawed-baker-act-rips-thousands-of-kids-from-school/)) in our Powerless series on Florida's Baker Act. The law was meant to help people in mental health crises, but our investigations revealed glaring flaws in its use on kids. 

Nearly 100 children a day across Florida end up at mental health facilities, with more than 36,000 placed under the Baker Act last year. The state isn't even tracking its use at public schools, so we built a database. We found it's been applied at least 7,500 times in Tampa Bay's public schools since 2013, and probably far more. Most decisions were made by law enforcement with little training instead of mental health professionals. An expert says the Baker Act is abused statewide and used as a way to get kids out of school.

One disturbing aspect we learned: Parents and guardians often have no say. We spoke to families where autistic children ended up in police cruisers, despite their individualized education plans and no mental health diagnoses. Families say they were traumatized. Some facilities even put them in harm's way.

Ask us anything.

This Sunday, December 15th is the deadline to get health insurance for next year in most states, so if you live in the US and don’t get insurance through your job, parents, or something like the VA or Tricare, now would be a good time to sign up.

We are HealthSherpa, experts on the ACA / ""Obamacare"" and have helped 3 million people enroll since 2014. This year, 1 in 5 people signing up in [Healthcare.gov](https://Healthcare.gov) states are enrolling through our site - that's 1 million people since Nov. 1. Our site ([HealthSherpa.com](https://HealthSherpa.com)) shows all the same options at the same prices as the government site [Healthcare.gov](https://Healthcare.gov), with no biased sorting, upsells or other shenanigans. 

You can also submit a Medicaid application on our site if you are in one of the following states: AL, AK, AZ, AR, DE, FL, GA, HI, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MI, MS, MO, MT, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY. Note that Sunday's deadline doesn't apply if you are Medicaid eligible.

These states have later deadlines and their own state exchanges. If you are in one of these states, you should go directly to the state exchange linked below: 

* CA - 1/31: [CoveredCA](https://www.coveredca.com)
* CO - 1/15: [Connect for Health Colorado](https://www.connectforhealthco.com)

The following states still have individual mandates that mean if you go uninsured in 2020, you may pay a fine: 
CA, NJ, DC, MA, RI. There is no fine for not having health insurance in other states.

Anything we tell you about plans on our site is also true for plans on Healthcare.gov, so you should use whatever you are most comfortable with - what's important is that you don't miss the deadline!

Ask us anything!|"We are the [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)](https://maps.org/), a 501(c)(3) non-profit research and educational organization founded in 1986 that develops medical, legal, and cultural contexts for people to benefit from the careful uses of psychedelics and marijuana. For an introduction to our work, we invite you to watch MAPS Founder Rick Doblin, Ph.D., present the [first official TED Talk about psychedelics](https://www.ted.com/talks/rick_doblin_the_future_of_psychedelic_assisted_psychotherapy), filmed on the main stage at TED2019.

Our highest priority project is funding clinical trials of [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)](https://maps.org/research/mdma) as a tool to assist psychotherapy for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). [Preliminary studies have shown](https://maps.org/resources/papers) that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can help people overcome PTSD, and possibly other disorders such as anxiety associated with life-threatening illness and social anxiety in autistic adults. In MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, MDMA is only administered a few times, unlike most medications for mental illnesses which are often taken daily for years, and sometimes forever. We also [study the therapeutic potential](https://maps.org/research) of LSD, ayahuasca, ibogaine, and medical marijuana.

On July 28, 2017, MAPS and the FDA reached agreement on the Special Protocol Assessment for [Phase 3 clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy](https://maps.org/research/mdma/ptsd/phase3) for PTSD. Participants will be randomized to receive three day-long sessions of either MDMA or placebo in conjunction with psychotherapy over a 12-week treatment period, along with 12 associated 90-minute non-drug preparatory and integration sessions. On August 16, 2017, [the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to MDMA](https://maps.org/breakthrough) for the treatment of PTSD. We are currently seeking research volunteers for Phase 3 clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. For more information on study participation, please visit our website: [mdmaptsd.org](https://mdmaptsd.org/).

In addition to clinical research, we also sponsor the [Zendo Project](https://zendoproject.org/), a non-profit psychedelic peer support and harm reduction service that provides a supportive space with compassionate care for people undergoing difficult psychedelic experiences at festivals, concerts, and community events.

Now is a great time to become involved in supporting our work—[Donations to MAPS are currently being doubled $1-for-$1](https://www.razoo.com/us/story/Psychedelic-Dinners)!

I am Rob Sell, a search and rescue tracker, cybersecurity professional, and founder of TraceLabs.org, where volunteers compete to find clues to the whereabouts of missing people. AMA!|"Hi Reddit! I'm Robert Sell, an information-security professional and 10 year volunteer with Coquitlam Search & Rescue (SAR) in British Columbia, Canada where I specialize in tracking lost persons in the back country. This experience has allowed me to see first hand the impact missing persons has on society.

To put it in perspective: every day, over 2,500 Americans are reported missing. This includes both children and adults. This does not include Americans who have vanished in other countries, individuals who disappear and are never reported, or the homeless and their children.

In most jurisdictions, missing persons cases receive low priority. Authorities are already working homicides, robberies, rapes, assaults, traffic issues, and crime prevention.

In response to the lack of urgency, priority, and lack available resources to investigate these cases, I founded [TraceLabs.org](https://TraceLabs.org).

Trace Labs brings together computer experts and online sleuths to find clues to the whereabouts of missing people. We do this by hosting ""Capture the Flag"" style competitions at security conferences around the world like DEFCON and BSIDES, and through ongoing daily operations online.

Volunteers track down relevant publicly available information (otherwise known as Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT) for missing persons cases where the police have asked the public for help. We then turn over any information found to the police to aid in the investigations.

A recent Freethink video documenting our work has now been viewed over 3 million times: [https://www.freethink.com/videos/online-hackers-hunt-down-missing-people](https://www.freethink.com/videos/online-hackers-hunt-down-missing-people)

Ask me anything!|"Hi, I'm Rushan Abbas. I'm  one of the Uyghur People of central Asia, and the Chinese Government has locked up many of my friends and relatives in concentration camps. I'm trying to help bring the worlds attention to this issue, and to shine light on the horrific human rights abuses happening in Xinjiang. I'm the founder of the Campaign for Uyghurs, and I'm a full time activist who travels the world giving talks and connecting with other groups that have suffered from Chinese repression.

Today I'm being helped out by Uyghur Rally, a group of activists focused on demonstrations and campaigns around these issues in the United States. Ask Me Anything!

Since 2015, the Chinese Government has locked up millions of ethnic Uyghurs (and other Muslim minorities) in concentration camps, solely for their ethnic and religious identity. The ethnic homeland of the Uyghurs has become a hyper-militarized police state, with police stations on every block and millions of cameras. Cutting-edge technology is used to maximize the efficiency of this system, with facial recognition and biometric monitoring systems permeating every aspect of life in Xinjiang. This project is being orchestrated by the most senior officials in the Chinese government, and is nothing less than a full blown attempt to effectively eliminate the Uyghur people and culture from the face of the earth. This nightmare represents a profound violation of human rights on an industrial scale not seen since the second world war. They have gone to enormous lengths to hide the extent of this, but recent attention from investigative journalists and activists the eyes of the world have been turned on this atrocity.

UPDATE: 12/12: WOW! Front page. Thanks so much Reddit! Well, from Uyghur Rally’s end, we’d like to say a few things:

First of all, we are DEFINITELY not the CIA… we are just a group of activists that care a lot about something. Neither is Rushan. Working for the US government in the past doesn’t make you a spy, and neither does working to end human rights abuses. Fighting big wrongs requires allegiances between activists, nonprofits, and governments… that’s how change happens! So, for those of you who say we are the US government, you can believe that… but it’s not true. 

What is true is that something horrific is happening. There’s multiple ways of understanding it, and some details are hard to confirm, but there is overwhelming evidence of atrocities happening in XinJiang. This nightmare is real, no matter what the CCP says, and we feel that everyone in the world has a moral responsibility to do something about it. 

A lot of people have spoken about feeling helpless – so what can you do? Here’s a few things:

1) Donate to Uyghur activist organizations – Campaign For Uyghurs and others (https://campaignforuyghurs.org/). Support other organizations representing oppressed religious and ethnic minority groups, such as the Rohingya in Bangladesh. Support Free Hong Kong.

2) Follow us on social media - @UyghurRally, @Rushan614. Read and share media articles highlighting what’s going on in XinJiang. Western media has done a good job of covering this, but all over the world it is being highlighted.

3) Join our stickering campaign! “Google Uyghur”. You can print out stickers on our website (https://uyghurrally.org/) and distribute them!

4) Boycott Chinese goods manufactured in XinJiang, and avoid companies that do business there or support the technology of repression. Cotton from Xinjiang is a big one, as are Chinese facial recognition/AI companies.

5) Contact your government and ask them to do something about it! In the US, this is your senators and your congressmen. There are bills passed and being drafted can do something about this. Other countries around the world are also considering doing something about this, so look into local activist groups and movements within your government to stand up to Chinese oppression.

6) Stay active and watch out for propaganda – question everything! It’s nice to see such a robust discussion occur in the comments section here on Reddit. That couldn’t happen in China. 

Also, a last note. The Chinese government is not the Chinese people – sinophobia is a real problem in the world. This is one nightmare, and shouldn’t encourage further global divisions. The only way forward to find a way to be on the same page, and to support people everywhere all over the world. Freedom is a fundamental human right.

e9kc6w|2019-12-12 07:15:12|Hi Reddit, IamA wildlife photographer from Cape Town, South Africa, specializing in snakes, scorpions, and spiders - Ask Me Anything you've always wanted to know about snakes or other venomous animals.|"I have been a trained & permitted snake handler for a couple of years now, using my free time to relocate wild snakes people find in their homes or businesses back to nature.

A year ago I got my first real camera (Nikon P1000) and took up wildlife photography, you can see my favourite photos of 2019 here:

* Part 1/3: [https://imgur.com/gallery/sOFQeC7](https://imgur.com/gallery/sOFQeC7)

* Part 3/3: [https://imgur.com/gallery/G2DtA0D](https://imgur.com/gallery/G2DtA0D)
* Several of my photos and videos are also posted on my /r/SnakeRescue subreddit.

For me, photography is a way of capturing natural scenes that won't ever exist again - animals in a certain pose, or reacting to a certain situation. Since many of my subjects are snakes, scorpions, spiders, and the like, photography is also a way for me to show people who might never see these animals in real life, what they look like and how they behave.

I try to submit data about the things I see to various research projects, and it's nice to think that someday in the future the small contributions I make might help advance science in some tiny way.

My favourite way of spending a Saturday morning is getting up early, going for a hike in a new place, taking pictures of what I see, then afterwards researching the species I hadn't encountered before.

It's therapeutic - not just because I'm out in the fresh air, getting exercise, and learning - but also because I often get a glimpse into a hidden world that others might just pass by.

May God bless all of you with peace.

Signing off,

Lina++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are many reason why people suffer alone rather than seeing a therapist.  For example, they:

* may have been raised in a culture that frowns upon seeking help, or
* may not believe that mental health diagnoses are real, or
* lack trust in counseling/psychotherapy due to generations of abuse of power by the medical community, or
* think that people would be fine if they would put their trust in God to heal them, or
* have been told by others that they should just ""get over it"" and move on with their life, or
* they had a negative experience in counseling in the past and are scared to try again, or
* you just don't know how to find a counselor who would be a good fit for you.

As a therapist, I meet clients who suffered for years before coming to therapy.  Some of them used drugs or alcohol to manage their pain.  Some isolated themselves, and felt the walls closing in as their depression or anxiety grew worse.  Some used self-injurious behaviors or considered (or attempted) suicide when their pain became too much to manage.

I understand how difficult it can be to trust.  I had very disappointing experiences with therapists in the past, and even experienced some very unethical behavior by people I went to see.  Just like any other profession, ours has some duds.

So many times, I have sat down with a client for an initial intake appointment and heard the words, ""I really should have done this a long time ago"".  I always suggest that when people are calling a therapist for an appointment that they ask the person on the phone: ""Tell me a little about your approach to counseling.""  This allows you to hear the professional describe how they work with clients and gives you a chance to get a feel for the professional, before you decide to schedule your first appointment.

If you have struggled with anxiety, depression, panic, childhood trauma, military trauma, perfectionism, relationship problems, poor self-image, addictions, racial/sexual/gender/ability/religious discrimination, what has held you back from seeking counseling?

e9c3vl|2019-12-11 19:51:53|We are scientists at the UF Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research with 12 years of sea turtle biology and marine ecology experience between us. AMA!|"Hi Reddit!

We are Alexandra Gulick and Nerine Constant – PhD Candidates at the [Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research](https://accstr.ufl.edu/) and [Department of Biology](https://biology.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida. Through our studies, we've traveled across the world to study sea turtles in their nesting and foraging habits.  With sea turtle populations rebounding, we are now exploring the question of sea turtle impact on seagrass beds.

In August, we returned from a research expedition to the Sargasso Sea as part of [Greenpeace’s Pole to Pole Expedition](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/21690/greenpeace-launches-pole-to-pole-expedition-in-bid-for-global-ocean-treaty/) to study thermal properties of floating mats of *Sargassum* algae. *Sargassum* mats are important developmental habitat for sea turtles, providing a place to hide from predators, find food, and grow. We evaluated whether these mats also provide a warmer environment than the neighboring open water, potentially increasing sea turtle growth rates.

Creating detailed thermal profiles of *Sargassum* mats will improve our understanding of the importance of this habitat, and in light of climate change, may help predict potential impacts of increasing sea surface temperature on the suitability of this habitat for sea turtles and other species.

We also hope this study and our collaboration with Greenpeace will help raise awareness of the importance of protecting the Sargasso Sea from threats like climate change and plastic pollution.

This work and the Pole to Pole Expedition have been highlighted by multiple media sources, including:

*A bit more about us:*

Alexandra: I completed my BS in Biology with a Marine Biology Emphasis at Oregon State University in 2013. Since then, I have been fortunate to study sea turtles in their nesting and foraging habitats in Australia and the Caribbean. In the age of green turtle recovery and the global decline of seagrasses due to human-related threats, my PhD research focuses on the foraging and behavioral ecology of green turtles in seagrass ecosystems. I am currently evaluating the productivity of naturally grazed meadows and how seagrass ecology may influence grazing behavior. This work will provide valuable insight into the role and sustainability of increased grazing pressure on seagrass ecosystem function and develop ecosystem-based approaches to green turtle and seagrass conservation.

Nerine: I completed my BS in Biology at the University of Florida (2012) and my Master of Environmental Management with a Certificate in Geospatial Analysis at Duke University (2015). I have studied human impacts on sea turtle nesting beaches in Costa Rica and Cabo Verde, and more recently, effects of green turtles on seagrass ecosystem services. My PhD research focuses on responses of ecologically and economically important fish assemblages to green turtle grazing in Caribbean seagrass meadows. This work incorporates my broader interests, which include studying the roles of sea turtles in marine ecosystems and contributing to conservation efforts and sustainable management of coastal resources.

I'm Matthew Piscitelli, an archaeologist, National Geographic grantee, and digital media manager with SEARCH - the largest archaeology company in the U.S. I've been discovering the adventure of archaeology on land and underwater for nearly 15 years.
 
Inspired by Indiana Jones and impassioned by a love of museums, I was drawn to archaeology at an early age. It's the thrill of literally holding something that no one has touched in thousands of years that draws me to the field. I'm a National Geographic Explorer and Research Associate at the [Field Museum](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/) who's worked in Peru, Bolivia, Greece, and the U.S. The most rewarding aspect of my job at SEARCH is being able to share wonderful discoveries with everyone whether through social media (check us out on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/searcharchaeology/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/search_archaeology/)!) or through innovative technologies like VR.
Also take a look at my work on the latest chapter of National Geographic Explore VR where it takes viewers through [Machu Picchu](https://www.nationalgeographicpartners.com/blog/2019/11/new-nat-geo-oculus-machu-picchu/).

Hi, Reddit. I post sometimes in [r/wallstreetbets](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and was urged to share my quirky story here. 

I'm in my late 30s, unmarried. My job - I give mostly mid-to-large sized privately owned businesses guidance on their regulatory compliance, I come in and give an outsider's thoughts on what they are going currently and on what they can do better. A lot of the time I come in after an epic massive screw up that's cost people a ton of money and a their jobs, so that's always fun figuring out what exactly happened. So many times it boils down to outright carelessness or woefully unqualified people making decisions that they shouldn't be in the position to make. It's a non-practicing legal job.

The money - I got out of law school in the 2000s and started investing in the stock market in the years before the Great Recession happened, so I was deep in the red right off the bat. I moved home with mom out of school so I could peg my expenses as low as possible so I could pay my massive student loan debt in under a year. Once that was gone, I stayed frugal and saved a couple hundred thousand dollars. After the Fed enacted the TARP rescue program and I realized the government wasn't going to allow any more core banks to fail, I invested almost everything I had and kept doing it into what I now know is the greatest, longest market rally of my lifetime. I got lucky. If I came into my savings at any other point in recent history, I would still be doing well but not nearly this well. I am grateful.

My mom - I've always been close to her because of the Asian momma's boy stereotype being true in the case, also because her English isn't great so I always need to be reasonably close by to help her with bills or anything complicated. she is in her 60s and became disabled in recent years with nerve damage in her leg. She can walk, she just needs someone to hold on to sometimes and someone to always carry her heavy walker out of the car, so that's become me. She's largely stopped driving on her own as a result.

As to the secret, I mean she's not stupid, she knows I have had a nice job and live comfortably. I pay for her shopping most of the time and give her cash gifts of maybe 50 to 100 bucks at a time all the time, as well as larger cash gifts on Christmas, birthdays, and so forth. But she clearly is unaware of how much wealth it is because she asks for so little comparatively and still agonizes over any small purchase and feels so guilty taking anything from me. My bank and investment statements are all electronic, so she can't accidentally stumble on any paper proof, either.

I don't tell her because I have not told anyone IRL. I don't want people knowing because I see how people treat folks who claim to have money and I want no part of it. And I don't want to ever be that obnoxious 40/50yo guy bragging to IRL strangers to make friends/gfs (hypocritical given this thread, yes). I've met several and it is sad. And I know how much of an gossip she is with her lady friends, she tells them whenever I do something embarrassing or about any tiny achievement in my life, zero chance she would keep something like this secret. Within a day of me telling her, she would have a line of female strangers in my driveway ready for me to choose. No thanks."|Throwaway54275|False|https://redd.it/e8ro0b|239|0.79|0|174|1|iama

e8t96i|2019-12-10 16:58:30|IAmA dentist in Florida here to answer any dental related questions you have and to give one of you a new smile this Christmas. Ask me anything!|"Hello again, reddit! 

I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving! My name is Dan and I am a dentist in Florida and the founder of the [12 Arches of Christmas program](http://www.12arches.com), a pro bono program we created to find 6-12 unsuspecting individuals once a year around the holidays in need of dental work and gift them a 48-hour full-mouth reconstruction, complete with permanent dental implants and custom milled hybrid bridges designed specifically for their mouths, known as the Done In One procedure. 

For anyone just tuning in, we had a 21-year-old female suffering from amelogenesis imperfecta who made a post on r/IAmA a couple weeks ago. Unfortunately, with the two jobs she is juggling in order to support herself through college, she was forced to decline the offer. Personally, I admire her prioritization and the dedication she had shown in responding to nearly each and every post in that thread. I won't include her username again just in case she isn't keen on any further distraction but if you're already familiar with the post, maybe drop her a line and some well-wishes for the holidays. Having put myself through college, as I'm sure a lot of you have, we all know how trying that period of our lives can be. She's one of the good ones. 

Moving on: We still have an opening in our 12 Arches program and, as is tradition, it wouldn't be complete without a redditor filling that spot. I honestly have my own personal hesitance towards presenting this as some kind of giveaway and it being erroneously perceived as some kind of PR stunt, which is why I always reach out directly to a redditor I feel is a good candidate for the 12 Arches program. But time is running short, we *need* a redditor to continue the tradition, and let's be real: this is reddit, it's going to be seen as a r/hailcorporate post anyway. 🤷🏻‍♂️ What can I do? 

Here to help me answer any questions you all may have is last year's lucky redditor, u/mikeytruant850. Mike has began working with our company as a treatment coordinator and is unique in that he can answer any questions with regards to actually being in the chair and receiving the procedure. Here is [his 12 Arches story](https://vimeo.com/307088451) from last year. 

**Just to answer a few questions off the bat:**

**1**) *If you have DMed me (via chat or private message), your username is already in the hat. If you made a comment in the previous IAmA stating that you're in need, you are as well. You will not be overlooked, but feel free to comment in this post as well. You are free (encouraged even) to share your story here again if you'd like. Believe it or not, your stories provide solace to a lot of people who are realizing more and more that they are not alone.*

**2**) *There were hundreds of messages simply asking for more information. I apologize that I am unable to get back to each of you individually but this AmA is also to provide that very information - whether about our procedure, dentistry in general, our 12 Arches of Christmas program, or in regards to pineapple on pizza (absolutely). If you have questions regarding the steps you should be taking towards improving your smile, you can ask them here.*

**3**) *One horse-sized duck.*

The concept of the 12 Arches of Christmas program was basically born here on reddit so this is just my chance to give back to the community. You can check my account age, my post history... I'm just a redditor in a position to help a few of you guys out for Christmas. I appreciate all the kind words and well wishes you've all sent but it really is my pleasure to be in a position to help anyone who hasn't been smiling lately to do so this holiday season. 

**Lastly, this is kinda something I do on my own, outside of the company, for you guys. I'd like to keep this confined to us, so reaching out beyond this forum to inquire about the pro bono aspect isn't necessary and may even hamper my ability to offer this program every year. Let's keep this online.**

Okay reddit, ask away! 

[**PROOF**](https://imgur.com/a/Z6WMJFu)

**EDIT**: *Okay everyone, it's past my bedtime. These were some great questions and if any more arise, I'll do my best to get to them.

Countless aircrew and passengers have their health and livelihoods ruined by accidentally being in an OIL FUME EVENT or SLOWLY BEING POISONED over many years and face a challenging time - all the while feeling like a zombie.

Because survivors have a collection of mysterious symptoms which GP’s aren’t trained to recognise, they face the prospect of gross misdiagnosis and mistreatment – which turns their lives upside down even more….

All may look well on the outside, but with tremoring fingers – this is a sure sign of poisoning!

A year and a half later we did just that.

\~2.5 years of construction nearly broke us in every way imaginable but with each passing season of being open the nightmare that is building fades further and further into the distance.

It's been a wild ride with incredible highs and lows. From ""Holy shit, I can't believe this is our life!"" to getting the plunger to dislodge some stranger's shit from the toilet bowl. We've met tons of amazing and interesting people and a handful of people who aren't welcome back, haha.

When we made the original decision to take this leap we figured that it was at minimum a 10-year investment. We're not quite 10 years in (April 1 makes 9 years in Mexico) but at this point we're definitely ready to sign on for another decade - even if we'll likely one day sell and move on to another adventure, simply for the sake of adventure.

Ask me anything except for the exact investment amount. That always gets asked when I do these...but let's just say that it cost approximately what you'd pay for a 3-bedroom house in the suburbs of a major city in the US but not a super expensive one like Seattle, SF, NY, LA or similar.

Completely unrelated slash bizarre questions are welcomed and encouraged.

EDIT: I'll remove this add-on if requested by the mods but I'd like to share some of this Reddit love with another traveler slash entrepreneur in Vannes, Brittany. I met Julian on a Quetzaltrekkers hike between Xela and Lago Atitlan (highly recommended) over 5 years ago on my first real vacation we could afford after setting up shop here. We were just coming out of the throes of the challenges of getting a business off the ground and so when Julian told me that it was his dream to one day open up his own restaurant I said, ""You ever open your own restaurant and I'll come to France and eat there.""

He did.

And I ate there last summer (as part of a longer trip, of course).

He's a cool dude and a talented chef...and Vannes is a kick ass place to see if you want to do something in France that's not Paris...so if you find that you're in the neighborhood, book at table at [L'ardoise](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g196537-d17780603-Reviews-L_ardoise-Vannes_Morbihan_Brittany.html) and tell him Oaxaca Mike sent you.

We just released a report on what took place here:  [https://medium.com/@eddiekrassenstein/unraveling-the-apparent-plot-to-destroy-ilhan-omar-through-private-texts-and-extensive-evidence-4d742b0ae813](https://medium.com/@eddiekrassenstein/unraveling-the-apparent-plot-to-destroy-ilhan-omar-through-private-texts-and-extensive-evidence-4d742b0ae813)

The plot included a court case here in the US where the Emir of Qatar's brother was being sued by a man named Matthew Pittard.  Pittard claimed that the Emir's brother asked him to murder two American citizens.  Those plotting to attack Omar either hijacked this case in order to present a fraudulent deposition, or they worked directly with the plaintiff and their attorney .

I'm going to grab a couple hours shut eye, but I'll be checking in on this intermittently throughout the day, so please do ask away. 

Hello Reddit! 

I'm a British filmmaker, who left my commercial filming job to travel to Ukraine, to report on the war here. I was inspired to do this after finding it almost impossible to find reliable & consistent English-Speaking videos from the region. I travelled here alone, without any language skills or contacts, but have since formed a local team. We're not sponsored or funded by any external forces (relying on my savings and crowdfunding), which enables us to bring transparent and unbiased updates from the front. Over the past 9 months I've had a lot of experiences on and off the frontline, from firefights in the trenches, interviewing volunteer battalions, witnessing failed and successful disengagement’s, visiting abandoned war-torn villages, and much much more.. So please do Ask Me Anything! P.S- I’ll be revisiting this thread again on Friday afternoon GMT, to answer questions from our European friends who will be sleeping now.

Our key work to date: 

Ecology Documentary: https://youtu.be/ZGevOX4j64w Our Ecology documentary was well received on our original YT channel, and helped bring worldwide attention to one of Europe's most polluted cities. Through the doc we've been able to begin the process of linking US based NGO's to local activists here and through the use of satellites and sensors they'll be able to begin collecting accurate data on the pollution levels. While not a short term fix- this will allow for a stronger court case in 5 years when enough data has been collected. 

Internally Displaced People Documentary: https://youtu.be/kyhJfpfMarU 
Our IDP documentary was hard to make, thousands of people left homeless by the war currently struggle with poverty. Our documentary helped rally the local community and NGO's which has led them to be included in weekly food and money deliveries, and receive a large sum that was raised internationally. These are not long term solutions though, and work continues through the Ukrainian Deputy PM to provide proper government assistance.

e63xwa|2019-12-04 19:00:10|I spent 22 years in prison for a crime I didn’t commit. Ask me anything|"Ricky Kidd here. In 1997, I was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for double homicide -- a crime I didn’t commit. I had a rock-solid alibi for the day of the murders. Multiple people saw me that day and vouched on my behalf. I also knew who did it, and told this to the police. But I couldn’t afford a lawyer, and the public defender I was assigned didn’t have time or the resources to prove my innocence. I spent 22 years in prison trying to prove the things my public defender should have found in the first place. In August of this year, a judge ruled that I was innocent and released me.

And I’m Sean O’Brien, a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and a founding member of the Midwest Innocence Project (MIP). I was part of an MIP team that represented Ricky over the past 13 years and that eventually got him released this year. I’ve spent decades working to overturn wrongful convictions, especially for inmates on death row, and before that I was the chief public defender in Kansas City, Missouri, from 1985 through 1989.

Ricky’s story and how it illustrates the greater crisis in America’s public defender system is the subject of PBS NewsHour’s latest podcast, “Broken Justice.” It’s the story of how we built the public defender system and how we broke it.

I am Whitney Butcher, and I am an attorney with Whitley Law Firm. I'm here to discuss the mass tort cases involving JUUL, the e-cigarette company.

Last week, at least [five lawsuits](https://apnews.com/66d00389118549abac8b7961971bbf8e) were filed against JUUL for deceptive marketing, claiming the e-cigarette's maker's ""advertising campaigns target young people to use nicotine without knowing the associated risks by enticing them with flavor pods."" According to the CDC, 2 out of 3 JUUL users 15-24 years old do not know that JUUL pods always contain nicotine.

We ( /u/ScheisskopfFTW and I) are back again for another AMA about Lily, Lily's List, and our life and journey of having a medically fragile child and then subsequently how we went on to build our family.

If you would like to check out last years AMA here it is: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a0mrdg/my\_daughter\_died\_from\_zellweger\_syndrome\_my\_wife/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a0mrdg/my_daughter_died_from_zellweger_syndrome_my_wife/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Lily was diagnosed with Zellweger Spectrum disorder at 2 days old. She was missing a large portion of her brain, was blind, oxygen-dependent, and suffered from constant seizures.** We had NO idea that she was going to be born with this condition. We learned that day, she would not live longer than 6 months. We had a long, fulfilling, but stressful and exhausting 5 months with Lily.  After she died my husband and I felt purposeless, so we started Lily's List. Lily's List is a nonprofit organization that specializes in sending boxes of items to help families with medically fragile children organize their home lives. None of these items are covered by insurance but drastically change the quality of life for the children at home.

We also learned that this condition is genetic and autosomal recessive. Any future children of ours have a 25% chance of being affected by this disorder. Thus, my husband and I chose to pursue IVF with Pre-Genetic Testing to test to make sure we didn't have another child affected by Zellweger Syndrome. Since then we have welcomed a healthy baby girl into this world, who is a carrier (but not affected) by Zellweger syndrome.

&#x200B;

**Please ask us ANY questions. No question is off-limits. My husband and I are incredibly open about our life with lily and everything after.**

I waited until I had Philadelphia + Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia, and knew it was finally time. I could get the transplant I needed my whole life. 

Of course the doctors thought I was only doing it to cure my deadly cancer that they gave me a 15% shot of beating once it relapsed last December. But I knew better. Those damned bee’s wouldn’t strike fear into me any more. 

So here I am almost a year later, I no longer have a bee allergy and I am cancer free (which is ok too I guess.) 

I got a bone marrow transplant from my sister, so I now have her immune system, and her blood dna. 

If you have any questions about bee allergies, or even the transplant process, or leukemia please feel free to ask.

I've had some horrible traumas. But I keep the faith, and work with Jess and Kevin to help the homeless reunite with the people that love them, people at where I was at a few years ago.""

**Brian**: ""I've lived in the Tenderloin in San Francisco for many years. It's changed a lot. I've been on the streets. Now I'm a community ambassador with Miracle Messages, to make a difference because that's what I'm all about.""

**Kevin and Jess** are the leaders of Miracle Messages, **a nonprofit reunion service for our neighbors experiencing homelessness to reconnect with their loved ones.** Our approach is simple and effective: a person isolated by homelessness records a short video, audio, or written message to a family member or friend, often with the help of a local referral partner, trained outreach volunteer, or formerly homeless ambassador. Then, dozens of internet-savvy ""digital detectives"" attempt to locate the loved one, deliver the message, and facilitate a reunion.

We offer a humane way to help end homelessness: reconnect families, shatter stigmas, and empower local residents to get involved. To date, Miracle Messages has reunited 266 families, with an average time disconnected of 15 years, using our mobile app, online and paper-based forms, and 1-800-MISS-YOU hotline. 80% of delivered messages have been positively received, and dozens of reunions have resulted in getting a client off-the-streets, all at a fraction of the cost of other interventions.

We believe that everyone is someone's somebody. Our work has been featured in the New York Times, Brut, NowThis, on a billboard in Times Square, in a TED talk, and 600 other publications, receiving 100  million views. Founder Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Messages in honor of his uncle, who lived on-and-off the streets for 30 years. We are on a mission to end relational poverty on the streets and, in the process, inspire people everywhere to embrace their homeless neighbors not as problems to be solved, but as people to be loved.

e52r7u|2019-12-02 18:00:15|IamA Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia now trying a totally new social network concept WT.Social AMA!|"Hi, I'm Jimmy Wales the founder of Wikipedia and co-founder of Wikia (now renamed to Fandom.com).   And now I've launched https://WT.Social - a completely independent organization from Wikipedia or Wikia. https://WT.social is an outgrowth and continuation of the WikiTribune pilot project.

It is my belief that existing social media isn't good enough, and it isn't good enough for reasons that are very hard for the existing major companies to solve because their very business model drives them in a direction that is at the heart of the problems.

Advertising-only social media means that the only way to make money is to keep you clicking - and that means products that are designed to be addictive, optimized for time on site (number of ads you see), and as we have seen in recent times, this means content that is divisive, low quality, click bait, and all the rest.  It also means that your data is tracked and shared directly and indirectly with people who aren't just using it to send you more relevant ads (basically an ok thing) but also to undermine some of the fundamental values of democracy.

I have a different vision - social media with no ads and no paywall, where you only pay if you want to.  This changes my incentives immediately: you'll only pay if, in the long run, you think the site adds value to your life, to the lives of people you care about, and society in general. So rather than having a need to keep you clicking above all else, I have an incentive to do something that is meaningful to you.

Does that sound like a great business idea?  It doesn't to me, but there  you go, that's how I've done my career so far - bad business models!  I think it can work anyway, and so I'm trying.

TL;DR Social media companies suck, let's make something better.

e4wni0|2019-12-02 09:24:32|I am a victim of forced pornography by the company GirlsDoPorn.|"Hi,
the title pretty much says it all.
I obviously do not want to provide proof to the public that I am who I am for the sake of my own safety and hoping the people who run this page will allow that but I am a 21-year-old (F) who was one out of the many women that have been lied to, blackmailed, and scammed into exploitation by the company GirlsDoPorn.

For the past two years, I have debated on posting something like this here in hopes to connect to other individuals who have gone through or are going through the same thing. For a long, while I have held back out of fear of being condemned due to lack of proof and the herds of misogynistic humans who believe that any one person that has had their legs open are immediately deemed as whores, nothing more, and definitely not someone to be taken seriously. Now that the founders of the company of GDP are being brought to justice and possibly being faced with life in prison (Here are articles to refer to: 

[GFP founders face child pornography charges](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Owner-of-San-Diego-Porn-Website-Face-Child-Pornography-Charges-564629681.html%3famp=y)

[GDP, a group of people who trick amd lure young women into doing porn](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/16/men-behind-girlsdoporn-lured-young-women-with-modeling-jobs-then-tricked-them-into-porn-fbi-says/%3foutputType=amp) 

[GDP faces criminal lawsuit ](https://theappeal.org/girls-do-porn-police-reports/) 

I feel (and excuse my language) a FUCKTON more confident in speaking out about this. I was 18 years old when I was coerced into working with that God-forsaken company. EIGHTEEN years old. A year older from 17, practically a child. My brain was not fully developed then and at 21, it still isn't!!! Long ass story told in short; I was lied to, told that I would be flown out to San Diego from Washington over 1000 miles apart from where I resided at the time and back for free, I was given fake but very reassuring female references who claimed to have worked with the same company before, I was given fake website links that supposedly displayed pictures of women they have photoshot before and all for the validation of a supposed ""photoshoot"". Everything they were attempting to sell out to me seemed all so legit so I figured, what could be the harm?

When I arrived there I was picked up by two men and a woman. They drove me to the hotel where I was then told that I only had one of two options: 1.) Perform a video shoot(s) with them or 2.) Find my own way back home. With little to no money and being alone in an unfamiliar state where I knew no one and being surrounded by persistently intimidating men, I felt obligated to oblige. In other words, I was left with no other choice.

I was told and reassured more than once that the video I was taping was only going to be sold to private collectors in countries such as India and the Philipines or Australia. When they had me sign their, what seemed like a 20-page consent form, I was pushed and rushed to sign without being allowed to read through it because I needed ""to get started with the real work ASAP because your returning flight is the next day."" They very briefly told me what the forms had supposedly stated and said ""sign here here and here"" quickly took the papers away and then continued to explain what I would be doing for the shoot. They told me the shoot would only take no longer than an hour, 5 minutes max for 4-5 different positions. It turned out nothing like what they had promised.

I ended up filming for 4 hours straight with less than a 3-minute water break in between. The man I filmed with was no way near gentle. I cried, screamed, and begged to stop in between sets, and even bled more than once. Every time I told them I wanted to stop they told me I was obligated to comply and if I didn't I would be going against my contract. Yeah, sure maybe that's why it took 4 hours lol I mean I guess. I never felt more used and broken after it was all over. I felt like every fiber of my existence was pricked and pulled out of me and shoved back in all at once.

Not to mention also, before I did the shoot I asked if we were able to use protection for the shoot because I was concerned about my sexual health &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; safety, the supposed manager provided me with ""proof"" of STD test results that belonged to my costar that showed up as negative for everything and said they had plan B pills on hand but 2 weeks after shooting I tested positive for chlamydia. This was all just the beginning of the nightmare of my life.

Approximately 1 month after I filmed with the company, I received a message on twitter from my best friend at the time, saying that she saw what I had done and that videos were circling around in my hometown with me in it. She was furious and condemned me for it. At that very moment, my chest sank deeper than the Mariana's trench. As you could figure, she was no longer a friend of mine after that. Not even hours past, I received sexually harassing messages from strangers and people I knew from my hometown. My mom, dad, step mom, god parents, aunts and uncles, my entire fucking family found out shortly after that same day as well.

That was all three years ago and within those three years I have been ousted from my family, group of friends, and school, my personal information had been leaked and exposed for anyone on the internet to have access to, I have been stalked, I have been raped in my previous workplace and I have OD'd once, almost taking my life. 

My life today has definitely shed some light but it will never be the same as it was before everything went downhill. I will forever have these scars, I will forever relive the memories in flashbacks and nightmares, I will never get back the people in my life that I have lost, I will never get back my dignity and reputation but at the very least, I will always be a stronger person than I was then. Here is another article from another girl who tells pretty much the same story: 

[A story from another girl who was a victim of GDP](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/evjkdw/she-helped-expose-girls-do-porn-but-she-can-never-outrun-what-it-did-to-her)

EDIT: please disregard my typo referring to Australia as a third world country.. It was a mistake I made while editing.. my apologies if I offended anyone😅

EDIT (I now have one form of proof without having to identify who I am, this is an email that was sent to me 2 years ago from Brian Holm who is one of the attorneys taking part in the lawsuit against GDP. I have said my part in the lawsuit and I have attempted everything in my power to do what needed to be done in the light of justice.): Proof (1)

EDIT: Also, thank you everyone for the abundance of responses! I am truly overwhelmed... lol I didn't expect this big of a turn out... I will respond to as many replies as i can... THANK YOU! ♥️🙏🏼

LAST AND FINAL EDIT: I think I am pretty much done responding to questions and replies now. Again, my sole purpose for this post was to be able to help and reach out to other victims of this kind of abuse. NOT to recieve pity and NOT to make excuses for what happened. Everything I stated are all factual. Thank you to everyone that blessed me with their kind words and encouragement to heal! I appreaciate that bunch of you so much! And as for the people that had literally nothing good to say, clearly the lot of you all get off by being rude and bodied by responses to your negative comments.

Greetings my  fellow redditors!

I'm Kara, here's my [proof](https://www.secretsafebooks.com/pages/about-secret-safe-books) And another [proof](https://www.etsy.com/people/SecretSafeBooks) !  :) I'm 44 and work from home handcrafting hollow books in lovely Stillwater, MN, USA. About 9 years ago I walked off my day job as a gallery guard at the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art and took up making books full time along with my husband.

In a nutshell:

* I graduated art school in '98 (studied painting and drawing)
* During college also took a fortuitous course in book arts
* Struggled with bipolar issues and past trauma issues throughout school and afterwards
* Liked painting kind of sort of? Unsure who I am? OK weird.
* Feared other people seeing my work (not good when trying to make money making art)
* Did odd jobs for 10 odd years (counting out drill bits, teaching basic papermaking, horrible stint at The Gap, horse-carriage driving, stuffing envelopes, selling luggage, a nice stint at Barnes & Noble...)

Fast-forward to my day job as gallery guard:

1. Midnight walked off shift that was supposed to end at 11 p.m.
2. Joyfully started full-time at home job as hollow bookmaker

# Rewind to why I started making hollow books:

* I thought of making a hollow book when daydreaming about Anne Frank hiding while I was at the museum while automatically telling people not to touch the art
* I wanted to use my hands to make something (but feared anything that would show my emotions to the world)
* Working from home helped me successfully manage my mental health issues

e4zv60|2019-12-02 14:33:29|"IAmA solo developer who quit their job and just open beta'd their first project ""Polar"""|"Hello redditors!

5 months ago I quit my job in big tech to move abroad, pursue my own interests, and evaluate where I want my career to go. After 4 years as a software engineer it wasn't until now that I've taken the time to think and realized I don't want to just chase money, I want to work on socially important problems.

I think even though the internet has connected us more than ever, people feel more isolated and less community than before. I'm truly grateful for online communities and the discussions that come with them, so I wanted to give back and build a product that helps people who struggle to find community in their everyday life. I built [Polar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epigramengineer.polar) with that in mind; leverage tech to help people connect with those in their community that they otherwise may have never met.

My goal was to build a minimally invasive product that connects people for meaningful conversation without requiring constant effort. There's a lot of other great products in this space (meetup apps, dating style apps for friends) that clearly work for a lot of people, but I found myself putting in a lot of effort, only to be ghosted or struggle to coordinate meeting in person. I wanted to build something that reduced the effort while eliminating the bias we have in who we meet.

I've made a ton of mistakes, learned a lot about myself, and have a long list of features I want to keep building.. but for now I'm pretty happy with the mess of an app I've created and I wanted to share it with someone. Ask me anything :)

I'm doing a PhD in Computer Science at Uppsala University in Sweden. I work in an area called **Social Robotics**. The long (long long) term vision many of my peers have for this area is to get to a point where we can build robots like Sonny from iRobot (to give you an idea of what we are doing). The field is in it's infancy though, so we currently have this huge expectation/reality gap, where we want to do something amazing, but the best we manage is make a robot do the dab.

I've done my bachelor's and master's thesis in machine learning and reinforcement learning so I have a decent amount of knowledge when it comes to AI. I received formal education in Math and Engineering, but am pretty much self-taught when it comes to programming and CS (doing that for over a decade now). Social robotics is 50% experimental psychology and 50% robotics, so I spend the last 1.5 years learning a lot of psych, too.

I've been teaching here in Sweden, and have done my bachelor's in Germany, and my Master's in the UK. If you have questions about that side of academia, feel free to ask, too.

I just want to say thank you to everyone who has asked me questions and shown support. it’s really nice to see so many people coming out to either show support or to express how they have a similar issue I’ll do a FAQ edit here in a bit.

Edit 2: FAQ

-Why not implants?
My insurance didn’t cover implants at the time and we didn’t have the money to cover the out of pocket expense. As for now, I’m not interested in letting another drill near my mouth ever again.

-How do you clean them?
I brush them with a kid’s toothbrush and kid’s toothpaste before letting them soak in water and denture cleaner overnight. I don’t need to floss them. I don’t think I even can floss them.

-What was the process like?
My dentist did it in stages where he took the back teeth out at first, let it heal, and then took the front teeth out. He did the top completely and then did the bottom. When I say “front teeth” I mean canines and teeth in between. I had various impressions done to get jaw shape and whatnot after the back gums were healed enough, so the dentures were ready (save for minor adjustments) by the time I got the front teeth out. They paired the impressions with xrays and physical photos. I didn’t have walk around without teeth. This lasted over the course of a year and a half. We scheduled it where we would roll over into a new year so my benefits would reset and we had more to work with. 

-How is eating now that you have your dentures?
Eating is roughly the same as people normally eat, but I have to adjust in certain ways. For example, I can’t have certain brand of gum, I have to cut up apples, etc. All of this I got used to growing up due to needing to be careful to not break my teeth.

-What about... you know...
My partner and I haven’t done anything without them in. He’s still new to this and I’m still self conscious. Maybe one day.

Edit 3: Hi everyone! I'm so sorry for taking so long to get back to you; I got super busy with the holidays. Thank you so much for everyone that has sent in a question both privately and publicly.

Other stuff

Sweep

See small bugs easily.

See anyone shorter than 5 foot 6. I'm a tall boi.


Things that I need accomadations for:

Unless it's a big monitor, I ethier need to be inches away from the screen or use a zoom software.

Rip my neck in theaters

I need to sit at the very front in all classes, and in some cases I still can't see the board. 

Other stuff that I'm too lazy to think of


Other things to know:

I lost all vision in my right eye due to a retinal detachment.

I used to go to the biggest middle school in our town until I was basically bullied out by the kids. I now go to a secondary school that focuses more on community and outside stuff. It's actually a really good place to be. They're actually supportive.

I have a slight hearing loss. Nothing major. I have a small hearing aid and even without it I can usually easily have a normal conversation.


I'll start answering questions at 11 AM EST and stop at probs about 11:30.


Update: To those who asked questions, thanks! To those who tried insulting me, thanks anyway! I think I'll stop replying now.

Hi! I work at Micro Center. If you don't know what Micro Center is, it's an American Electronics store and one of the only brick-and-mortars where you can purchase PC parts. If you live near one, stop by sometime! It's unlike any other retail place I've worked at/visited. In the spirit of Black Friday, I decided to do an AMA for anyone curious about MC and how they do what they do.

A few ground rules for this AMA:

I won't answer questions relating to the following topics:

\-Black Friday Sales. The ad is up on the website, go take a look.

\-Sensitive company information or personal/store information

\-Questions that bash the company or are hurtful in any way (obviously). In the Micro Center handbook, it states that employees are not permitted to disparage the company on social media, and I have no intention nor need to break that even on a throwaway account. I'll gladly say that I have very little grievances with Micro Center as a company, especially coming from the retail job I worked prior to Micro which handled employee relations/employee welfare much more terribly.

Otherwise, ask away!"|microthrow223|False|https://redd.it/e2tjuy|3|0.53|0|33|1|iama

I am currently investigating the “Tic Tac” UFO video shot by U.S. Navy pilots.  I first interviewed Mike Turber, a Former Air Force Intelligence Specialist who revealed that they are actually secret U.S. craft.  Turber also strongly hinted that he has ridden in one, flying from southern California to the East Coast in just 84 minutes, which was confirmed by his Google Maps page from that day.  He also asserts that President Trump ordered one flown to North Korea to impress Kim Jong-un.  The craft represent one of the most incredible scientific discoveries in human history, which, until now,  has been kept secret. The craft can fly through air, space, and water at incredible speeds while defying gravity due to a vacuum created around the craft.  The Navy was recently issued patents for very similar technology.

I've been studying Chinese for a bunch of years, and in order to give it a boost I decided to find a summer internship in China. What I ended up finding was a local factory that worked with a foreign company, and there I mostly worked with component testing and quality control, but for a week or two I was working on the actual assembly line.

While there I was living in the regular factory worker dormitory, meaning I shared a room with two other factory workers in a large building shared with other factories, ate at the dormitory cantina, used the squatting toilet and shower head-less shower, in general just experiencing the same daily life that the local workers go through.

I won't disclose the actual company, but feel free to ask me anything about what it was like working there, China in general, what it's like being a foreigner in China (I had previously lived in Beijing for a year), studying the language (Mandarin Chinese), sleeping on plywood, or just anything you want to know that I could reasonably answer.

Lately we have been traveling across the country learning about lesser known musical communities. Our latest episode is on the black gospel church and the music it has inspired. Beyonce, Aretha Franklin, Anderson .Paak all found their start singing in the church.

e1n2m6|2019-11-25 21:29:04|I am the designer and publisher of the upcoming boardgame Galactic Era - AMA!|"I am Channing Jones. I was born in 1966 and live in Kleve, Germany. As a kid I loved playing board
games. It then became my greatest wish to become a game developer. After studying math and computer
science at university I started working as a freelance programmer. At the same time (1996) I also started a
project called “Mysticora”, a fantasy PBEM computer game. I spent many years developing it together with
friends. The game was too complex and large though, so I stopped that in 2003. I learned that I needed to
develop something I could finish more quickly. So I decided design board games again.
In 2006, I then had what I now call my “great awakening”. I had a fleeting interest in UFOs and
reincarnation beforehand, but I never understood the big picture. In early 2006 though after two weeks of
intensive researching I finally understood it. I had discovered the coverup by the mass media and by the
world in general on many subjects, including 9/11, false flag operations, secret occult power structures,
hidden history, free energy, paranormal phenomena, UFOs, spirituality, and the nature of consciousness.
This also led to several years of me joining the esoteric community and becoming very active politically.
For example, a “9/11 Truth” presentation at the European parliament in Brussels in 2008. One of the most
fascinating events I participated in was a UFO watching seminar by Steven Greer where I went to Mount
Shasta, California and watched UFOs in the night sky as well as seeing a bright orb of light in the trees and
experiencing many unusual synchronicities.
To live true to my ideals, I finally decided to join an alternative, organic community farm called Vlierhof in
2009, where I live to this day. I like living here because it is a beautiful place with like-minded people and I
enjoy more freedom than with a normal job. In 2011 I discovered Bitcoin and immediately realizing the
possibilities I became very fascinated with it. I spent a lot of time in Bitcoin forums and invested what little
money I had then into it.
After several years of developing board games (I now have about 15 prototypes) I am also now getting
more involved in that space by participating in game author seminars and fairs. I have also taken up a parttime online job doing marketing for a game parts company. This is how I mostly earn my living nowadays. I
often incorporate my knowledge and understanding of the world in my games, too. My first published game

e0ud1p|2019-11-24 05:27:28|I am a recent Agricultural Science graduate currently working in the area of plant physiology. AMA|"I recently graduated with a degree in Agricultural Science, a multifaceted science which is a mix of geology, biology, chemistry, meteorology, engineering, economics and legislation. My graduating cohort was 60% female (21/35) and many people including myself did not come from an agriculture background. I grew up in the suburbs of a reasonably large town, and while I was always interested in agriculture, I had never worked on a farm before I started. After spending my teenage years and early 20s making bad decisions, I decided to do a bridging course at my local university to get me a new admissions score, choosing to focus on Chemistry, Anatomy and Environmental Science. The Environmental Science component of this course exposed me to  \[this TedTalk\] ([https://youtu.be/4EUAMe2ixCI](https://youtu.be/4EUAMe2ixCI)) which got me thinking about all the environmental good a sustainable agriculture industry could provide.   


I have worked throughout my degree on a couple of farms, for a trial plot company doing breeding line research, as a paid intern doing weed science and herbicide resistance research, as a casual laboratory technician and a laboratory demonstrator, teaching Botany, Soil Science, Animal Anatomy (with my greyhound Boo) and Biology.  Currently I am working as a lab tech on a few plant physiology projects, mostly relating to frost exposure triggering flowering, and how different plants ""remember"" how long they have been exposed to cold temperatures. Next year I hope to do my honours project on how different environmental conditions make poisonous plants more or less toxic to livestock. 

&#x200B;

Agricultural Science is a really interesting field (no pun intended) where you can do a lot of different things. Some of my classmates will go back to their family farm with a whole bunch of new ideas to improve things, some will work in a bank, some will work in consultancy, some will work in research. There are many programs where graduates can travel to developing countries and make a huge difference to subsistence farming communities who are vulnerable to climate change and the whims of corporate agriculture.   


I am located in the NSW Riverina, Australia in the wheat/sheep belt. Happy to answer questions on my degree, the industry in general, questions about plants, and if you have questions about your garden I will do my best to help.

e0jgpb|2019-11-23 15:44:03|Hi, I'm from Venezuela, I'm 24 years old, I'm type 1 Diabetic since 20 years old (4 years)|"Hi, I'm from Venezuela, I'm 24 years old, I'm type 1 Diabetic since 20 years old (4 years). I was born in Turmero, Aragua state, Venezuela in 1995, my mother and my father was a little older (he died 5 years ago) he was also diabetic and hypertensive. It was at the age of 4 when they see something was wrong because he was wetting the bed and that was not unusual. Yes, it was diabetes.

They tried many treatments; pills, diets, but nothing worked, only insulin worked since my pancreas does not work at all. To this day I am injecting two doses of insulin in the morning and evening, crystalline insulin (R) and NPH (N) became part of my life. Since my father passed away I worked for so many years in a manufacture of voltage protectors, I learned and loved it, but the situation was getting worse in Venezuela every day thanks to the bad government we have, finding insulin is basically an impossible mission just like any other medicine if u haven't money.

I was out of insulin, so I decided to go to Colombia with the little money I had saved, which over the days was devalued and the liquidation of the place where i works, hoping for the best.

To summarize, because I think my post is quite long, I've been in Colombia for two and a half years, I lived in Cucuta where it didn't go well for me and I finally arrived in Medellin with my partner, which has turned out to be my only help in Medellin, but she  also lost her job and eventually no money because food expenses are strong (I currently live in San Javier). During this time I had highs and lows but I always had a roof, food and I was able to buy insulin, although I had 3 diabetic setoasidoses due to insulin changes due to my financial instability (I changed from buying two bottles of each to measure my dose, which They cost $ 80,000 COP- $ 25 to buy premixes (70/30) since they are cheaper $ 30,000COP - $ 10, but that change didn't help me and almost killed me. I always had ... But not today.

I lost my job two months ago, luckily I paid two months of rent, but that was 1.5 months ago, I don't have nothing and I really don't know what to do anymore. When they notice despair, looking for a job is a hard task, not impossible but if it is very difficult when the weather haunts you, they also always offer me prostitution jobs and I am not one of those women, I like to work, although I respect who does it.

A few days ago an acquaintance told me about reddit and why not make a post and here I am. For those who have doubts, you can ask me anything you want. Thank you very much for reading me.

We’re joined by USA TODAY investigative reporter Gus Garcia-Roberts who told our story of murder, RICO and high design. Ask us anything!"|"Starting in 1979, Alexander Blarek and Frank Pellecchia, partners in love and high-end interior design, thought they found the client of their dreams in Jose Santacruz Londono, a Colombian tycoon of seemingly bottomless resources to spend on their wildest designs. The next two-plus decades held a lot of surprises. A mistress got murdered. They saw their client's mug shot on the cover of Time magazine. And after their client was killed, the feds came knocking, blaming the interior designers for the reign of Santacruz's not-so-secret empire, the billion-dollar cocaine conglomerate called the Cali Cartel. 
 
In a groundbreaking money laundering prosecution, federal prosecutors charged that in agreeing to design roughly two dozen of Santacruz's lavish properties, from the penthouse office suite at the center of his empire to the ""postmodern hacienda"" disguised from FARC guerrillas, the two interior designers were an essential part of what the chief of the DEA called ""the most well-organized and well-financed crime organization in history."" An incredible high-stakes court case followed. Investigative reporter Gus Garcia-Roberts recently told the whole wild saga in a [feature for USA TODAY](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/11/06/cali-cartel-leader-dies-interior-decorators-take-fall-crime/4050770002/). 
 
Now's your chance to ask us, the interior designers and the journalist, anything about what it's like to work for one of history's most prolific drug traffickers, how to survive jail, and how to hand-pick $350,000 worth of Italian tile to line a pool. 
 
Alexander Blarek is the highly-trained visionary designer born in Wisconsin. Frank Pellecchia is his Brooklynite project manager who makes sure his life partner's genius is never marred by a misplaced outlet. Gus Garcia-Roberts is the Los Angeles-based journalist who knocked on their door about a year ago to ask if he could tell their story.
