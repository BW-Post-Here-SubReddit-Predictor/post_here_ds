ekntcq|2020-01-06 03:06:29|With the fires in Australia it would be amazing if Niantic added Kangaskhan to spawn by using a special lure with proceeds going to help with the fires.|With recent events they have shown that the ability to make a lure spawn exclusive Pokemon is built in. This could be a unique lure, mossy lure, or incense but by allowing the Australian exclusive to spawn it would draw attention to what's happening and it would also be a chance to raise money for a cause that is very much in need.|ThePopojijo|False|https://redd.it/ekntcq|3092|0.96|2|106|1|pokemongo

ekxh2z|2020-01-06 17:47:29|My 2020 Wish list|"These are mostly QOL changes, some minor and some major, which I feel will improve the game for the majority. It's just my opinion and if you have a different opinion, feel free to share it in the comment section below.  


* A world map showing all gym, pokestop and raid locations like ingress intel map. People are already paying for this service from third-party apps/websites.
* Show candy distance and egg hatching distance in UI on main screen.
* Add an item or something to filter what pokemon we see first on nearby list. Like how it priorities pokemon you have never caught before as a silhouette. 
* Power up pokemon to max CP with one button like using rare candy.
* Let us delete eggs and add bonus tenth slot for adventure sync eggs which guarantees a 10km egg if you walked 50km+ that week.
* Show the odds for shinies and pokemon hatching from eggs, in-game.
* Re-work TMs where it works like a wheel instead of it being 100% random. For example, my Groudon has solar beam but I want earthquake. When I use a charge TM, I could get fire blast or EQ. If I get fire blast, I should get EQ next, it shouldn't go back and fourth between fire blast and solar beam over and over again so I have to use 20 charge TMs to finally get EQ. I should just have to use 2 charge TMs at most to get the move that I want.
* Raid passes should only be consumed when the raid battle starts. Not to enter the lobby.
* Have outfits in shop where it can be only earned and not purchasable to show you worked hard for it, like the fisherman vest. I caught 300 big magikarp so why should I have to pay for something which I earned.
* Introduce something like a prestige mode from Call Of Duty for hardcore XP grinders where you earn a cool medal when you reset to level 1 but you don't lose anything.
* I know you can see overall time defended in a gym but can I see how long my pokemon lasted in a gym before being knocked out.
* Notification who knocks me out of the gym every midnight at 12am. I can watch the gym being taken down and see him put his pokemon in anyway, you might as well tell us. (It's that nosey neighbour of mine)
* Make it easier to send gifts to friends.
* Add scroll bar to friend's list.
* Add search commands in friend's list for good, great, ultra, best and lucky
* Add option to auto delete friends who have not interacted with you for more than 7 days, 14 days, 1 month etc.
* Show number on stacked quests
*  Show how many hearts to reach next buddy level.
* Show emotion points and cool down timers for each buddy interaction.
* Show timers for lures and team rocket battles.
* Show S2 cell overlay when nominations pokestops.
* Make buddy spin a pokestop or gym nearby, a little outside your radius."|Ebonymous|False|https://redd.it/ekxh2z|160|0.95|0|27|1|pokemongo

ekzt4a|2020-01-06 20:30:52|What if: Kecleon|"So you know how some people are complaining that Kecleon isn't in the game yet? Well what if he is, just invisible? So of you tap around your screen blindly you might find one some time. 

Now yes, I know this isn't the case, it would've been found in the code by now, but what if they did this when adding Kecleon? Again, yes, it would be annoying to have to just tap around blindly, but then they could incorporate your buddy. Let's say you have your buddy walking with you on the map and it all of a sudden walks over somewhere and signals you somehow, maybe with a speech bubble with an exclamation point ""!"", you tap where he is signalling you and poof, you're in an Kecleon encounter. 
I dunno, I think that could be an interesting and fun way to incorporate the Pokemon's ability and make use of the new updated buddy system."|JezzeJ|False|https://redd.it/ekzt4a|23|0.77|0|3|1|pokemongo

Hes lv 40 all he does is look for shinies.

So everytime we clicked on a pokemon the game would ask us to turn on the camera.  Thats like an added 2 second per click.  Hated it.

We tried disabling permissions. And messing around with camera permissions.  They worked in a quick fix per session.  

But We found a solution.  Delete pokemon go and download the previous update from apk on a mirror.

I have written a complaint already and I don’t even know if anything is being done about it. I don’t have the time and money to go to downtown or buy the coins. I can’t come home without checking the gym and using a golden razz berry just to get 10 minutes of defend time.

Update: thanks for all the replies but the problem still persist, I went out around 5 am to Ladmo Park and the area was completely empty and the gym requires you to be IN the park so I would have seen someone-that and any cars at the edge of the park would have not been able to reach the gym.

ekrhij|2020-01-06 08:54:11|Hatchathon week 1 results|"http://imgur.com/gallery/J3wcGGb

Okay,  someone from last week inspired me to go super tryhard mode for this event. So this is a majority of walking and playing manual, a decent bit of go plus driving, and some sock technique at home during late nights. Was working OT this week so every day was before and after normal 8 hour 3 30 to midnight work shift.

First couple days was end of xmas event and rest of it was obviously hatch event. General idea was I would get full eggs and hatch every day a few times and during late nights would get full set of 7m eggs from gifts and pop a star piece before all hatched while playing, and sometimes once more using sock strat at home. 

Was trying to mash my obsession with shiny alolan vulpix with how good the double stardust for this is. I've played a lot this week, and I'm freakin tired,  but I think timing star pieces for hatches makes it super possible for people who dont play super insanely to get an easy 1mil dust from this event. That being said, this is obv not super free to play friendly, had lots of incubators from boxes I got over the summer and stuff like that, I understand this is a little p2w.

I'll track my total dust better next week as about half this week was still the xmas event , but as far as total shinies go from this week of hatching I got one in total, Mawile. Derp.

My idea is that each account can place one custom pokestop anywhere they want. But only they can can see it along with friends that are at least ultra friends and being unable to move it for a long period of time, say 100 days. 

At each one of these pokestops pokemon become more common for that spot then would otherwise show up. But like I said before only you and people who are at least ultra friends with you can see it. That was eliminating a massive influx of nee pokestops and messing with the balance of the game.

When it's plugged in, it connects to the Go-tcha app just fine and shows up as an available device on Pokémon Go, but won't connect to Pokémon Go at all.

ek4ssb|2020-01-04 23:58:52|PSA: Best friends upgrade and double XP - don't miss out if you can't co-ordinate lucky eggs with the other player.|"I see a lot of people talking about how they co-ordinate their gift opening for best friends. This is of course the best way to do it so both players can easily get the 200k XP. However if for any reason it wasn't possible or if your timing was off, don't worry it's still possible to double the XP without much effort, you just have to be fast with the menus.

So, if you are aware of being 1 gift away from BF status and there is a gift already in play, what i have done successfully a number of times is quickly open the friends list as soon as you open the game to check if the other player has opened the gift and the friend status has indeed upgraded visually. If it has, all good you haven't yet missed out on the XP.

From here, close the friends list and as quickly as you can open the item inventory, minimising the time on the open world screen as much as possible (you don't want to give the game an opportunity to present the friends level upgrade screen). Now pop a lucky egg and close the inventory screen. Wait a few seconds and you'll receive the friendship upgrade screen with the double XP awarded to you.

Hope that helps anyone in a similar situation as i have been recently."|hexagrm|False|https://redd.it/ek4ssb|176|0.95|1|17|1|pokemongo

ekb472|2020-01-05 09:56:31|An open discussion on the environmental impacts of playing Pokémon Go by car|"I'm sure most people will have heard of the catastrophic damage that is being dealt to many parts of Australia right now. I'm fortunate enough to live in Sydney where we are fairly distant from many of the affected areas but the past few weeks have certainly been stressful hearing all the destruction  to all the families, home and wildlife in affected areas. Being outside on certain days was ill-advised, something that I have never really experienced in the 20 years I've lived here. Many experts point this to climate change even though our own Prime Minister denies these links.

I was playing POGO in my local area and I noticed one of my local multiaccounters was driving from gym to gym taking over everyone single one with their accounts across all teams. This would normally make me think about how Niantic has been letting players like this get away with this behaviour for years but this time I started thinking about how routinely certain players played in this way.

I feel like from my local communities that it's so common and normal for players to drive to raids or do their nightly drive to take over gyms every single night to ensure they are able to attain their daily 50 gym coins. I can imagine tens of thousands of people at this very moment doing their daily gym routine by car. Every raid day I'll hear about how some players will drive from gym to gym to achieve 50 raids in this time (let's not even talk about how dangerous they may be to other people on the road). Every community day I hear about people driving from cluster to cluster to maximise their shiny count although I'm not sure how various able this is now with the recent spawn shift.

I wanted to started a discussion on this because I wonder if anyone else has thought about the environment impact of how some people play. Do you think it's a non-issue? Either because there's no link or because the impact of Pogo players is miniscule? Do you think Niantic holds any responsibility for incentivising driving behaviours?

It is very disappointing when I spend 10 minutes fighting down a maxed out gym just for a guy of another team to jump into the last battle, make one hit, and then swipe the gym from me. 

An easy way to correct this is to award the gym to the guy who either took out the most Pokémon or did the most damage.

If trainer A battled and knocked out five Pokémon from the gym and trainer B (different team) jumps in half way through defeating the sixth Pokémon, trainer A should be the only one to be allowed to claim the rights of the gym even of trainer B did more damage on the final Pokémon because Trainer A knocked out the previous five, thus doing more damage overall.

I had a 10km egg incubated that only needed 500 more meters to hatch. So being behind my laptop I started shaking my phone for some minutes when it hatched. I was prepared to be dissapointed once again, after previously getting a ton of dratini, larvitar, beldum mareep, and more recently feebas, absol and mawile. 

I don't know exactly how many 10km eggs I've hatched in the past, but in total I've walked over 1100 eggs and I almost spend all my coins on incubaters to hatch as many 10km as I can. Eggs are about the only way I could get that Gible (and Deino for that fact). I live outside of a small town and can 'only' see (thanks to pokestop nominations) 5 stops from my home, so the chance of finding a Gible anywhere nearby is practically 0. I've seen his shadow 2 times when I was in New York and 1 time when I was in Barcelona, but due to it being al the way accross the map and being with people that don't play Pokemon Go I couldn't get them.

So without any expectations he, who is said to not exist, suddenly popped up, I couldn't believe it for a second. About 9 months after its release I finally got him, with 15 attack and 64 candy's as well! Now you could say I can calm down on hatching eggs, but... There is still a Pokemon called Deino whose final evolution is my favorite all time pokemon so... Back to hatching more eggs.

He gets lucky here and there but most matches we have I end up as the winner which didn't make sense to me until I did some digging.

Every now and again I'll notice that he won't use the right charge move to attack me with. I just figured it was a TM issue but no. **Most of his PVP Pokémon only have one charge move**. I thought this to be odd since we're both level 40 but when I viewed his catches I then noticed the issue. He's a *new 40* which means he's not going to be as invested as someone who's been going hard for over a year and has remained active since then.

I'm not saying that you have to be a certain level to be competitive in PVP. Not at all. But you do have moving forward to be invested which is where the problem I feel will come from since not many people who actually want to battle will have acquired millions of stardust saved up.

[ValorAsh](https://youtu.be/430TELkSuCU) for example was level 39 when he won Regionals early this year so it's totally possible to be competitive and under level 40. But what chance do most trainers have when they can't afford expensive moves for Pokémon like legendaries who are very threatening in PVP?

Normally when I go over there I’ll head to a certain parking lot where there are a lot of stores and a lot of poke stops and I’ll hit them all in my car and then park somewhere, catch some pokémon and make the circle again. Well, today, this is exactly what I was doing. It was pretty early, around 10 am, and the stores didn’t open till around 11 so the parking lot was pretty empty. I had probably been there for about 15 minutes when I saw some person ride up close to my car on a bike, wearing sunglasses and covering their face with a scarf, taking pictures of my car. I guess they thought it was suspicious that I was in the parking lot when the stores weren’t open or something? It really freaked me out so I just drove off and went home. I wasn’t doing anything wrong, but still I don’t really like the idea of someone taking pictures of my car like that especially trying to go through all those extra lengths to cover themselves to hide their identity like they’re some kind of undercover spy or something. When I got home and talked to my boyfriend about it he seemed to think that they would be able to find out my name and where we live from having my license plate.

ek3bnw|2020-01-04 22:07:01|Buddy system does not work for me ...|"Do you think similarly? Let me know if you feel like it.

For me, the current system has a lot of inconsistency ...

I mean ... on the one hand you want pokemon buddy which will get the most of the buddy system and/or you need its candy.

On the other hand, you probably want your favorite as a buddy.

Immersion fights here with the game mechanics, your real buddy loses to what you “need”.

For example, my buddy at this moment is Lucario - because I need these candy so badly.

But I'd prefer to have Sandslash (regular or my shiny alolan), Golem, Weezing as my buddy. It would be great, but I do not need these candies, and in addition if I do, I lag behind MewTwo’s with boosted CP.

I feel there is some lost potential here.

Wouldn't it be great to have your favorite pokemon as a buddy that you could use to make something unique? So that you don't have to regret that your buddy is not ‘meta’?

For example:

\- Your buddy trains with you, after x fights alongside you can teach him a move that he normally can't use.

\- Your buddy trains with you, every x battles alongside his stats increase. You breed up Rhyperior disguised as Golem. ; D

Wouldn't it be great if in pvp someone threw a Weezing at you with a buddy ribbon and it turned out that this is a one of a kind and really strong Weezing?

It's just an opinion. : D

ejknw2|2020-01-03 19:50:54|PSA: Get your buddy excited just before hitting their candy distance for 2 candies instead of 1 - Observations on distance / buddy candy mechanics when excited|"So was playing around with the buddy system last night and found this tip that might be helpful to others.  When your buddy gets excited as we know their candy distance gets cut in half.  If you are already over that half distance (Example below) the game will grant you a candy automatically and convert the left over distance to the new target.  When they are no longer excited your distance progress stays the same.

Example:

Metagross - Normally 5km for a buddy candy

(not excited) 4.6 km / 5 km distance shown on progress bar

Feed Poffin or get it excited \*without\* traveling any more distance

1 candy granted by game, distance progress bar now at 2.1 / 2.5 km to next candy.

Walk .4 km and get 2nd candy.

So this can be super helpful if you are leveling up a legendary buddy where their normal candy distance is 20 km.  If you are at let's say 18 km or higher it might be worth feeding it a Poffin or get him excited (if you can without him going over the 20 km distance mark) to get 2 candies instead of just 1.

Funny side note, when i first hit excited I saw my distance bar go down, so I thought that it converted what you had already traveled into 1/2 so that the only benefit was when you were traveling with them excited.  I then noticed it didn't scale when they were no longer excited and thought that was a crappy game mechanic.  I didn't notice it gave me the candy for the 1/2 distance already traveled until I looked closer :)  All good now."|ElChambon|False|https://redd.it/ejknw2|15|0.94|0|2|1|pokemongo

ejcl79|2020-01-03 08:22:07|College PoGo Group Chat Civil War|"I thought I’d share this because it was one of the most surreal things that I’ve ever been a part of. So I go to a small college with a tight-knit community. Despite this, we have quite a few gyms and pokestops so there are quite a few people on campus who play. For raids and events, we had a campus-wide PoGo GroupMe called the Pokémon Go Pals. It was really fun to have a set group of folks to play with. It was not uncommon for 40 of us to gather for a raid, having to split into separate groups. It helped me meet a lot of cool people and to get out and be more active, which occurs to me was the point of PoGo in the first place.
Recently however, there was some interesting drama in the Pokémon Go group chat that is equally one of the funniest and unrealistic things I’ve witnessed. It all began when the top player on our campus was (allegedly) caught geospoofing. We’ll call him Gary for our purposes. Gary has a bit of an ego and apparently had been caught geospoofing before. After reporting him and nothing happening, the players in our PoGo group chat decided to deal with the issue ourselves. The owner of the group chat, we’ll call them Richard, kicked Gary from the group and multiple people had a problem with it. The issue soon became very political and parties were instantly formed among the group chat. The Pokémon Libertarians postulated that no one should decide who should or shouldn’t be in the group chat, as it should be a free and open platform while Niantic should enforce its rules; not a gaggle of college nerds. The Democratic Pokémon players believed that it should be put to a vote to decide whether Gary should be allowed to participate. The Pokémon Judiciary, a smaller but louder speaking party, believed that a small group of judges, one from each team (valor, mystic, instinct), should be put together, a council if you will, to decide Gary’s fate. After hours of debate and the inability to tell what percentage of this whole situation was satire and what was not, I decided to throw my trainer beanie into the ring. While acknowledging that geospoofing is a dick move, I suggested that dicks aren’t beaten by adding more dicks, cuz come on, dicks+dicks=more dicks; it’s simple math really. After putting forward this point, the final Pokémon party rose. Under the dicktatorship of Richard, the PokéCommunist party was born. Richard got pretty triggered at being called a dick, and began deporting people from the PoGo Pals left and right. After many memes, many casualties, and more dicks, all the parties fell to the admin privileges of Dicktator Richard. At this point, having fully assumed the title dictator, purged most people from the group, effectively destroying the fun atmosphere it had created. There is now a smaller group chat called the Loké Pokés, but it is almost half the size of the original group. The only light of hope for vengeance comes in the small resistance force that survived the purge. This resistance force has been dubbed by some, The Holy Knights of the Group Chat Rapture. The current plan, is that if the Pokémon Pals ever goes public again, the remaining Knights will purify the group chat by rapturing all that remained, destroying the corrupted group chat and finally striking revenge toward Dicktator Richard. For now, all is well as we wait for our opportunity for revenge.

Recently for no reason (other than they’re mostly crotchety old people) the residents have been particularly angry about people walking around the neighborhood playing Pokémon GO. 

We have three gyms, one is a park, one is a wetlands picnic area, and the other is our fountain that marks the entrance to the neighborhood. We also have one PokeStop, which is an area in the middle of the neighborhood that has a few memorial benches.

They are claiming that we’re playing on private property- which just isn’t true! I did some research and these landmarks and sidewalks in our neighborhood are not private property- they are public property. Technically, you’re only supposed to have your children play on the play structure or use the picnic area if you pay your HOA dues, but there are no signs posted that explain this.

Long story short, the HOA is claiming they are going to ask Niantic to take down the three gyms and the PokeStop in our neighborhood. If this happens, how do I and the other members of our neighborhood that are avid Pokémon go players stop this/bring back the gyms?

TLDR: My neighborhood is full of old crotchety people who want to ask Niantic to take down our three gyms and our pokestop and I want to know how to prevent them from doing so."|huskyhusky2|False|https://redd.it/eiq29f|3335|0.96|0|462|1|pokemongo

ejgh85|2020-01-03 14:58:39|My declining interest in this Game|"THIS ISNT A COMPLAINT THREAD. 
I think this game is actually pretty good: constant events, a constant shakeup of spawns and whatnot. 
However my growing disinterest in this game is mainly on real life factors, and I guess i wanted to get it off my chest here 

I used to not think much of PoKemon Go. I had never played it even during its 2016 hay day. However last August (2019) I saw one of my friends pull out PoGo and I thought it was funny, so to spite him I downloaded the game to try it out. But soon I quickly found myself becoming hooked. I would start asking him questions, and showing him my catches. At the same time my other best friend got into it as well.
Then I started to pay attention to the meta, seeing what was good for raids and competitive play. Despite the truth that Pokemon Go was about the long game, I was hooked and strapped in to play. Was even curious to see what my stuff would look like a year from now.
So from September to about November I would go out with my two buds to catch pokemon/stock up on items, do community days, and would run outta the house to do exciting raid bosses with them. I joined this subreddit to learn new things, enjoyed arguin with my friends about which Mons were the best, and even started rewatching episodes of the anime. I would say that I checked PoGo about 10 times a day. It was really special. 

However all of this happened my senior year of High School. And as senior year goes things began to change. My two friends started to go into different friend groups, and as such their priorities and interest in the game declined. I stopped getting gifts, and their last catches would show 2+ days ago. I would say it was December Community day when reality hit me. I was excited to go out and catch stuff with them, but one of my friends had work and the other was doing stuff with his new girlfriend. As such I did the community day grind by myself, and i didnt feel the same. Ended up playing 1 day instead of the planned 2. 

So lately, I have been haphazardly checking PoGo for spawns, i am not as up to date on the current events and bonuses, and I hardly do raids anymore. The excitement of seeing something rare or hatching something good just isnt there. I dont plan on doing a stock up for a while, and despite Piplup being my favorite pokemon Im not sure if i’ll even do its community day. I wont say im ready to put the game up (ive checked 3 times today lol) but it certainly has started to become a chore. 
Im not really mad at my friends, things happen, but i am mad at circumstance as i dont like change.

ej19b6|2020-01-02 17:33:53|[Story] I decided to go all out for the Winter event. Here are my stats if you are interested.|"As the title says, I decided to play as much POGO as humanly possible from the start of the event on December 24th to the end on January 1st. My results only include what was shiny since that is what is important to me and not detailed breakdowns on what I cought or hatched. Either way, here are my results:

Hatching:
I hatched a total of of 191 eggs. 106 from the first week of the event ending on Sunday the 29th and 85 from the 29th to the 1st of January. 
The goal was to get the alolan Sandshrew or the alolan Vulpix in their shiny form. 
From these hatches I got the shiny versions of alolan grimer, cleffa, budew, mawile and magby. All other hatches were not shiny. 181 eggs were 7k, 5 eggs 10k and 5 eggs 2k. Total walking distance for both weeks was 137.4 km.

I also hatched 21 pichus with a beanie and got no shiny. 

Raids:
I did 19 Stantler with bells raids and hatched 13. Out of the 32 I encountered between both, I got 1 shiny variant raiding.

Wild encounters:
Through wild encounters I got: 1 shiny Pikachu with beanie, 2 delibirds, 1 natu, 1 buneary,  1 snover, and 5 sneasels. My best day was catching 5 shinies in that same day. It was crazy I know!!!

Overall I got 17 shiny Pokemon this event. Didn't get the alolans but I got a lot of other amazing ones. Now I normally don't buy incubators but since I had a little spare cash this holiday season I decided to test out the egg hatching system. I can say I got my needed endorphins.

eji3uj|2020-01-03 16:54:25|How do you deal with spoofers?|"Let me start out by saying that if this post sounds like I am complaining and whining, I do apologize. I am truly only here to ask for advice from anyone who is willing to give it. 

So for the last few years, the local players and I have had a constant problem with spoofers. In the early days of the game, they were apparently really bad (I was not here when the game first came out), and with Niantic's efforts to combat spoofing, their activity has gone down. We would see them driving around on community days, raid hours and other major events in the game. However, they were still able to spoof, as they would take practically every gym in the downtown area. We knew they were spoofing because there would be several gyms going down at once and not a soul was in sight (most gyms here are hard to reach from within buildings). Now, ever since the introduction of two new EX raid gyms in our area, they have been incredibly bad. Constantly taking gyms, making sure they stay in there for days, making it hard to really enjoy the game overall. There have been numerous players over the time span of the game that have quit because of the spoofing group.

So, in conclusion of this rant, I am in need of advice. What do you guys do in response to spoofers? I know one of the most obvious things to do is to report them, but that has been done several times up until this point. Plus, we know that this group has at least 10 accounts that they constantly rotate through. To be honest, it makes it discouraging to even try taking down gyms and getting those 50 coins. Again, I apologize if this post came off as me whining or complaining about something small. I just don't know what to do at this point. 

Thank you for reading and I hope you have a good day!"|MrBarriq|False|https://redd.it/eji3uj|0|0.3|0|4|1|pokemongo

ejdx29|2020-01-03 10:57:34|Gotcha question|"Hi everyone.

I consider buying a Gotcha or Dual Catchmon. However I'm not sure which one would fit my needs, that is why I'm asking for your advice.

I'm pretty much regular daily player. Recently I've started to play on second account, which I want to use as a help when raiding with my fiancee. Right now when we go out and play I'm doing it with two phones in both of my hands, which I dislike. That's why I thought about gotcha, so I could use it with my alt account and play manually on my main account. I would also use it when I can't simply play on two accounts simultaneously.

However I've now read about Dual Catchmon and thought that I could use it for both accounts. Like using it all the time on the alt and using it on main while I can't play manually (driving etc.).

Now I have a few questions.

Is it worth using Gotcha on an alt account?

If it fails to catch a pokemon it runs away? For example if I see some rare pokemon on my main account and then I enter the secondary one it will be gone?

Is it worth paying \~35$ more to get a Dual Catchmon than regular Gotcha so I could use it from time to time with my main account?

Thanks in advance for your comments."|DarkDancerr|False|https://redd.it/ejdx29|0|0.38|0|3|1|pokemongo

I gave up on ever really finishing these as I had no goddamn free time. Apparently kids need attention or something, the noobs can't even walk when they come out. 

Right before the end of the New Year I got this skunky from 12ish? (I think) candy to 50 by walking with my dad every other day when we went to visit, that with adventure sync and today I managed to get all three done!

I've heard that you reduced numbers of the Pokémons that hatched from 10km egg, so it's easier to hatch rare Pokémons than before.
But the reducing numbers of Pokémons turns meaningless if you reduce the chance of dropping 10km egg too, and I think you didn't notice that. It's really genius way to exercise and frustrate trainers though.
Anyway, I've been walking to hatch 2km eggs that you gave me all time when I spin the pokestops even in this new year holidays. And I got 3 2km eggs and a 5km egg today. Yay.
Thank you for keep me walking in freezing cold outside. I don't know why but I caught a cold by the way.

Also, could you stop suggesting AR+ mode every time when I tap a Pokémon on a map? It's also really clever way to annoy trainers  though.

The decoy grunts in the final stage of the GO Rocket quests are a decent diversion go keep players searching, and can even be used to farm dust.

For someone to reach the final stage of the quest line, cant there at least be some level of excitement? Mixing up the lineup each month, or even letting the grunt use a random lineup from regular grunts would at least make the hunt for Giovanni less of a chore, and more fun for players. Niantic could even give the grunt their own shadow pokemon exclusive to them, similar to rocket bosses.

ein15h|2020-01-01 20:09:29|What is the trade value of Shiny Groudon? (~1700 CP)|"I have been offered shiny lugia (\~2000 CP), shiny entei (\~2400 CP), and shiny suicune (\~1400 CP). As well as 2700 CP Dragonite (not shiny) and 2800 CP Metagross (not shiny, not meteor mash). 

I'm really not sure what to do and I would like to get an idea of what the groudon is worth and what would be a good trade. I know that any of the shiny legendaries are pretty fair offers. But my concern is that 1) im not a big collector of shinies and 2) im pretty sure we will be able to catch those legendaries again in the future. As for the dragonite and metagross i dont have either of them and dont have close to enough candy to evolve dratini or beldum.

eibd5d|2020-01-01 00:28:41|Why “announce” that vulpix and sandshrew are in 7k eggs?|"In the blog post for December’s events it says the following:

POKEMON APPEARING IN EGGS: Alolan Sandshrew, Alolan Vulpix, Pichu wearing beanies, and Stantler wearing bells will be hatching from 7km Eggs!

Now the thing is Alolan Vulpix and Alolan Sandshrew have been available from 7km Eggs for ages.  So what was the point in including them alongside event costume Pichu and Stantler?

At first I thought that they would also have the beanies like Pichu but I admit that is a gramatical grey area.

There is really nothing exceptional about these two appearing in 7km eggs but they decided to point it out anyway. They really should have put down the whole list of Pokémon: Alolan Geodude, Alolan Meowth, ...

The only excuse I can think of is that they were trying to highlight that these two are Ice types like the rest of the Pokémon involved in this event. but if that’s the case why not say; “More ice type Pokémon can be found in 7km eggs like Alolan Sandshrew, Alolan Vulpix along with Pichus wearing beanies and Stantlers wearing bells.”

But I can’t help but think that it has been worded to mislead people."|Firstearth|False|https://redd.it/eibd5d|8|0.71|0|8|1|pokemongo

eihfsw|2020-01-01 11:29:13|Event discussion|"1. Attached to last year's Global Challenge Ultra Bonus was the suprise temporary wild release of alolan vulpix, alolan sandshrew, mawile and absol, which was honestly one of the best suprise from niantic in a long time. We all know it's available in raids and can be hatched from eggs which are both the cash cow system for Niantic. It would be nice to see a return of those 4 in the wild as a mini event of sorts. Would be enjoyed by the mass I presume.

2. Two of the very famous pokemon in the pokeverse, Chansey and Snorlax. Both has baby forms which are both available from 7km eggs which once again Niantic's cash cow system. These two being shiny available in wild would be the right approach, as it is somewhat vastly known by the masses. (Ash's Snorlax & Nurse Joy) Following the trend of Pikachu, Roselia, and most recently Mr.Mime being shiny available in wild even though the baby forms can be hatched is a great idea. We can only hope for a massive event for these two, to be available in wild as shiny. 

I know there's gonna be arguments of nah you can always hatch them, raid them or trade them, not everyone can or luck out. Just wanted to know about your thoughts on this."|CPN_Navin|False|https://redd.it/eihfsw|0|0.33|0|3|1|pokemongo

My college doesn't have any ex gyms, so it is a big deal for me to get to do one and every time I've gotten a pass I've been on vacation somewhere or some bs like this happens. I've gotten 3 on vacations or day trips and missed another 3.
