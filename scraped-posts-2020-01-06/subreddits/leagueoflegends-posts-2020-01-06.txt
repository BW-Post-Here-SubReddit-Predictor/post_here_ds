Tired of your rare precious girlfriends cheating on you with the cute rockstar chad?
Tired of having Tryndamere syndrome?

Well, look no more, because Swain's guide to absolute chadness will help you achieve the alphaness every man needs to lead a fulfilling love life!

Chapter one: Changing your speech. 

Words make a man, and you, my friend, are no exception. Girls see you as a total loser because your speech pattern reveals you have never stepped on the battlefield or conquered an empire. How pitiful! But worry not, here you have some examples to get started on your new life:

-Instead of ""Good morning/evening"" try saying: Empire above all.

-When a girl asks you about your hobbies, just respond ""How tedious"". This will give you an air of mystery ladies love to fall for. 

-When asked about your job, you have tailored responses for some common professions:

Instead of saying you are a teacher, try: ""I do so enjoy explaining things to idiots""

Office job? Just tell her ""I am surrounded by incompetence""

Veterinary? Give her some wise advice: ""Never make a bargain with a demon you intend to keep""

If you are a Journalist, just tell her how things really are: ""There is always a choice, truth is no exception""

-When she is with a group of friends, don't act like she is the only one for you, instead, go in front of them all and ask: ""Which one of you is Beatrice again?""

-When she tells a bad joke, just let your inner sociopath respond: ""I am not smiling, i am threatening to smile. It is still a threat.""

-She talks about politics? Shut her up  with """"People often ask for a hero, when a villain is what they truly need""

-Still discussing politics? Just resort to good ol ad hominem: ""The mind is the weapon. You are unarmed""

-She wants you to met her parents? A brave man chooses their fears carefully, my lad: ""It is not the visions that haunt me, but what i do not see""

-She has narcissistic tendencies? Bring her down with a simple: ""You can sit on a throne, that doesn't make you a ruler. It only means you have an arse""

-Caught her cheating? Get out by the front door like a king by laughing and exclaiming: ""It is just as the spies described. A pity I had them executed.""


And thats all for today, folks.With these tips, you should at least land a date or land in jail, a calculated risk that's no risk at all!

If they like the skin they just consumed the shard of, now instead of getting it for free they would have to spend money, when instead they can just wait and break down other skin shards they know they wont like to get this skin for free. 

I think making the rental needs to be changed altogether. One idea is that the rental can only last 24 hours but not consume the shard so they people can know for sure if they actually want to put the time and resources into unlocking the skin.

Realistically its just a pointless option that could be actually useful if it didn't consume the shard.

Edit: well I guess this blew up, my intention wasnt to just complain, I would really like it if Riot tried to do something to make the rental actually usable or some sort of replacement/ way to test the skin other than looking at skin spotlight, which I dont think is even officially from riot, although he does a kickass job."|JakeTR33|False|https://redd.it/ekh445|8891|0.98|0|454|1|leagueoflegends

eko8oz|2020-01-06 03:40:50|I don't understand the reasoning behind removing the reduction of Illaoi's E duration when you hit her with an ability. Riot is all about making the game less oppressive, yet this change makes Illaoi even more oppressive.|"**Removed: Spirit duration is no longer reduced by 1.25 seconds each time the target damages Illaoi with basic attacks, by 1 second with single target spells and by 0.66 seconds with area of effect ones.**   


**In the past when Illaoi hit you with her E, you could actually fight back** and remove it before you got damaged too much by it. The act of engaging Illaoi in close range was already dangerous enough. Doing while your spirit was pulled was even more dangerous, but when you managed to remove the spirit it meant you actually had a chance of fighting back. **It rewarded the player for biting the bullet and going in. Fighting for the a chance to win, regardless of the conditions. Just like Illaoi does in the lore and its good risk/reward gameplay wise.**

&#x200B;

**Now there is no reward and the risk is insanely high**. The moment you get pulled its game over. You are going to be taking a BS amount of damage regardless of whether you run or fight. The circle is huge and when you move out you've already taken 2 Ws and several tentacles, easily chunking you to half, all from a single E.

And you aren't rewarded for actually taking a risk and fighting Illaoi when she pulls you. **Which is why I don't understand the reasoning behind that change.**

**Its absolutely stupid how Illaoi basically wins lane with a single E grab.** Just like Old Nidalee's spears. She can spam it and the moment it hits once, its over. Theres nothing you can do about it."|jtpredator|False|https://redd.it/eko8oz|1029|0.9|0|413|1|leagueoflegends

This would be a great improvement on Ahri, she would feel smoother in my opinion. I feel like a lot of people want it and it would be a smart move since Riot just keeps pumping out Ahri skins anyway.

Cons:

1. It’s expensive for what it is - I paid 115 USD/152 CAD for a cotton jacket and T-shirt. Onto the value part later.

2. It SMELLS. They were like soaked in vinegar or something, the acidic smell is so strong I can’t even try them on.

3. It’s really poorly made. The material feels very cheap, the printing is inconsistent - jacket is fine, T-shirt has very smudged printing.

Pros:

1. I guess it’s kind of low profile, the printing is not too in your face making the wearer look like a complete nerd for embracing his or her league rank. Some say the summoner name and emblems are too small, I’d say it’s fine, people who know what it is will appreciate it and it’s not too much of a show-off.

Overall, I think the jacket is somewhat worth it if you can get it for cheap shipping (living in Canada doesn’t help). Getting both the jacket and T-shirt is definitely a stupid purchase. But hey, I get to show off my diamond rank to strangers.

Edit: also, for these overpriced merch I hoped Riot would give me some kind of pat on the back saying “Congrats on x rank, keep it up next season” or a simple thank you for buying our shit.

ekwj56|2020-01-06 16:40:34|"I'm recreating Runeterran languages #10 | Speaking Vastayan"|"(tl:dr follows as usual)

Hej everyone,

I hope that you’ve all had a wonderful time / survived the in-laws during the holidays. But now that the new year is in full effect, I thought it was time for an update on the project. Ionian has grown even more. There is even a small guide on speaking basic Ionian in progress. But now I’d like to give the spotlight to a language we haven’t spoken about a great deal: Vastayan.

I gave a small update three weeks ago, but now it’s time to share the bones of the language, and how it differs from Ionian.

Vastayan and Ionian both share the same ancestral language, namely Ur-Ionian. The split between the Vastaya and the Ionians caused the languages to grow apart, resulting in two different modern languages. They share a great deal of vocabulary, though the words have changed a lot. For example, the Ur-Ionian word \*intja \[ɪnt͡ʃa\] turned into \[intjɑ\] in Ionian but into \[ɪnːtaya\] in Vastayan.

Now we don’t have a lot of info on Vastayan. A friendly rioter posted a few hundred words about the Vastayan language. We can learn a great deal from those words, even though there are not so many. I don’t want to make this post too long, so I’ll mostly talk about the juicy bits, though I’d be glad to answer questions about the specifics. Note that we are technically dealing with the *Baraashi* dialect of Vastayan, but since we don’t have any other leads it’s as good of a place to start as any other.

# 1. The Gender Conundrum

A pretty big difference between Ionian and Vastayan is their grammatical genders. One has masculine/feminine while the other has natural/spiritual. I was able to come up with a possible explanation for it, though note that it is pretty much fanfic, there is no evidence for it ;.: My proposed theory is that Ur-Ionian (their ancestor) had masculine and feminine gender. The origin of the gender could be two ancestral gods; one of which, a man, would represent the physical world, where the other, a woman, would represent the spiritual world. The Vastaya stayed close to this mythology, and kept their genders as masculine/feminine, representing those two long forgotten deities. The Ionians, on the other hand, lost touch with their old gods. Their grammatical genders slowly turned to generic groups instead of the original divine deities.

# 2. Sounds and Syllables

We don’t know a lot about the sounds of Vastayan. They are based on Finnish, but the only voicelines we have come from Xayah, and she speaks with an ~~American~~ Ionian accent. This means we’re going to have to glue together a coherent sound system from our hints. The full charts will be posted on r/Runeterran, but here are the important bits.

· Vastayan has short and long vowels. A word like Baash and Bash have different meanings.

· The h can either be pronounced like Scottish ch or as a mix of that sound and a j.

· Just like vowels, consonants can be long or short. A word like Tan has a different meaning than Tann.

· There are a number of diphthongs such as *ai* and *ou*.

· Vastayan also has a so-called glottal stop. This is the sound very common in languages as Arabic, Danish and Dutch and is found in English when pronouncing butter as bu’er. Vastayan also uses ‘ to write this sound.

· They are also quite prone to change. A g before an h sound is pronounced differently than a g in different positions.

# 3.  Words and Grammar

Contrary to Ionian verbs, Vastayan verbs are just one word that never changes. The verb *na* will be *na* in every situation; it is never inflected. Vastayan also has tense markings on subjects. For example, *baa* is used in present tense, while *baasi* indicates future tense, e.g. ‘I will.’ Words like adjectives also have a different form depending on whether they are part of a masculine or feminine word.

# 4. Conclusion

Now to finish this post I’d like to look at a Vastayan sentence and translate it to Ionian to look at the differences.

Vastayan

    faash  vastaya   na 
    faːʃ   ʋɑstaja    na 
    they   vastaya    be.not 
    ‘They are not-vastaya’

Ionian

    aazo      vastta   okh      ruan-kkē
    ɑːzo      θɑstjɑ    ox      ruɑn-kje 
    they.NAT  vastaya   tand    together-NEG 
    ‘They are not Vastaya’

Even though the languages are similar, the sentences are very different. The biggest difference are the verbs, since the particle structure in Ionian changes how the sentence works. Another interesting part is how the word for Vastaya has changed over time. Ionian can’t pronounce the ‘v’ and use a ‘th’ sound instead. The ‘taya’ part has also merged together to ‘tya.’

That was all for now, I hoped you enjoyed this sneak peak into Vastayan.

Cheers,

Nanna

Tl;dr: I’ve described some basic parts of the Vastayan language and how it differs from Ionian. Where Ionian is more similar to Asian languages, Vastayan has drawn more from Arabic and Finnish."|Songbirdur|False|https://redd.it/ekwj56|49|0.81|0|3|1|leagueoflegends

The enemy team rushed rift and dropped it top once we informed them that Fiora and Rammus had disconnected. They pushed all the way to our nexus towers off the rift, but we held them back with all our might. 

Malz proceeded to farm supers for the next few minutes, so he had bags of pennies ready to be converted into tonnes of space AIDS.

They crashed into our base while trying to push with a second Rift, but they did it split instead of as a group, so we held them off as a team and ended up acing them.

A few more minutes go by and we have 3 open inhibs and the enemy team get Baron.

Once more to break our defense, but we have a stinky rat and space AIDS to hold them off. Another ace.

After that ace, we're just playing the new Farming Simulator 2020, so we've got some strong items behind us.

Kayn also died of AIDS. RIP in peppers. 2017-2020

The AIDS is airborne at this point and wipes out the rest of the enemy team. 

Another ace! 

Nexus also dies of AIDS.

""gg : ^ )""

Drank 5L of water afterwards to rehydrate myself from the salt of the enemy team.
Most exciting match of my life :D 
I love League of Legends. 
Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

The print is not flexible but it won't shatter if broken, took about 3 hours to print and then 20 minutes total work to print. There's likely a few errors, the main one I see is the eye, the pupil is a bit thicker than i would have liked but i think vel's pupil changes size every now and again, I could be wrong though since I don't play him often

It’s hilarious.|When you play mid or ADC, a lot more people try to fight you or are willing to fight back when you go after them.  But as soon as I play Malphite, their tune suddenly changes.  They start running for their lives as I try to get near them and fight them.  A pleasant change of pace.  It’s hilarious how even when they do the most amount of damage, they know they can’t 1v1 you as a tank, so they don’t even bother trying.

ekvi9c|2020-01-06 15:23:14|Beware, every champion I touch gets nerfed|"It all began when I decided to expand my champion pool as a main mid, diamond hardstuck, who only plays 2 champs in ranked, one who is now high risk no rewards, completly nerfed to the ground because of proplay and only viable in certain matchups (LeBlanc) and the other who is strong but not very fun to play (Ahri)

So I wanted to learn and possibly main some of the midlaners I find oppressive and which will be worth my time, I started with Irelia, and after just 2 weeks, she gets nerfed, I say alright no problem it's not the end of the world, as there are plenty fishes in the rift.

I then swapped to Rumble, started studying him very hard, gathering guides, looking for good otp streamers and participating in the mains subreddit, and I kid you not, just a few days later the patch notes drops and he is nerfed because of his Mid presence.

After that came Aatrox, but I do not wish to talk about this chapter of my life I need to forget as it was very painful for both my mind and body.

Now I tell myself that I'm really unlucky and decide to go for a very popular champ because like Ahri, rito doesn't dare to mess up with popular attractive champions, and I pick up Akali, it was a huge hit on my pride as a midlaner because I've always considered her a broken champ made for edgy players, and I was right after starting to play her but I never imagined that she was going to be THAT fun to play, she provided me much more pleasure than any other of my mains, I then got 2 skins in a row with hextech boxes (Project and Inferno), I absolutely stomp with her and the RNG gods are smiling upon me, I found ""The Chosen Champion"" it's my time to shine and finally hit challenger ! However Riot was watching me all along and drops the nerfs, I'm completly devastated, Akali is still strong and fun to play despite that but god do I have to invest so much more time in her to be able to carry in this state, nothing different than LeBlanc, so not worth it.

I had enough ! I have to resort to my trump cards, after playing since season 1, Riot finally broke my spirit and I draft both Kassadin and Ryze, the two broken childs of the game, the two champions who are only weak for 3 minutes of the game and completly dominate the rest going 1v5 no matter the elo, but I forget to place my wards while pushing, and like a fed Rengar, the patch notes get the jump of me and both are hard nerfed.

I'm telling you all of this because my next target is a perfectly balanced champ whose mechanics completly fit my playstyle, so forgive me Camille mains, for your mistress is getting nerfs in the upcoming patches, such is my curse."|Landiesth|False|https://redd.it/ekvi9c|19|0.7|0|34|1|leagueoflegends

ekw6a3|2020-01-06 16:13:59|"I'm recreating Runeterran languages #10 | Vastayan"|"  

(tl:dr follows as usual)

Hej everyone,

I hope that you’ve all had a wonderful time / survived the in-laws during the holidays. But now that the new year is in full effect, I thought it was time for an update on the project. In the last three weeks, Ionian has grown a lot. We're currently working on a small book that will teach you the basics of Ionian. This post, however, will feature Ionian's sister-language: Vastayan. 

I gave a small update three weeks ago, but now it’s time to share the bones of the language, and how it differs from Ionian. 

Vastayan and Ionian both share the same ancestral language, namely Ur-Ionian. The split between the Vastaya and the Ionians caused the languages to grow apart, resulting in two different modern languages. They share a great deal of vocabulary, though the words have changed a lot. For example, the Ur-Ionian word \*intja \[ɪnt͡ʃa\] turned into \[intjɑ\] in Ionian but into \[ɪnːtaya\] in Vastayan.

Now we don’t have a lot of info on Vastayan. A friendly rioter posted a few hundred words about the Vastayan language. We can learn a great deal from those words, even though there are not so many. I don’t want to make this post too long, so I’ll mostly talk about the juicy bits, though I’d be glad to answer questions about the specifics. Note that we are technically dealing with the *Baraashi* dialect of Vastayan, but since we don’t have any other leads it’s as good of a place to start as any other. 

# 1. The Gender Conundrum

A pretty big difference between Ionian and Vastayan is their grammatical genders. One has masculine/feminine while the other has natural/spiritual. I was able to come up with a possible explanation for it, though note that it is pretty much fanfic, there is no evidence for it ;.: My proposed theory is that Ur-Ionian (their ancestor) had masculine and feminine gender. The origin of the gender could be two ancestral gods; one of which, a man, would represent the physical world, where the other, a woman, would represent the spiritual world. The Vastaya stayed close to this mythology, and kept their genders as masculine/feminine, representing those two long forgotten deities. The Ionians, on the other hand, lost touch with their old gods. Their grammatical genders slowly turned to generic groups instead of the original divine deities. 

# 2. Sounds and Syllables

We don’t know a lot about the sounds of Vastayan. They are based on Finnish, but the only voicelines we have come from Xayah, and she speaks with an ~~American~~ Ionian accent. This means we’re going to have to glue together a coherent sound system from our hints. The full charts will be posted on r/Runeterran, but here are the important bits. 

· Vastayan has short and long vowels. A word like Baash and Bash have different meanings. 

· The h can either be pronounced like Scottish ch or as a mix of that sound and a j.

· Just like vowels, consonants can be long or short. A word like Tan has a different meaning than Tann.

· There are a number of diphthongs such as *ai* and *ou*. 

· Vastayan also has a so-called glottal stop. This is the sound very common in languages as Arabic, Danish and Dutch and is found in English when pronouncing butter as bu’er. Vastayan also uses ‘ to write this sound.

· They are also quite prone to change. A g before an h sound is pronounced differently than a g in different positions. 

# 3.  Words and Grammar

Contrary to Ionian verbs, Vastayan verbs are just one word that never changes. The verb *na* will be *na* in every situation; it is never inflected. Vastayan also has tense markings on subjects. For example, *baa* is used in present tense, while *baasi* indicates future tense, e.g. ‘I will.’ Words like adjectives also have a different form depending on whether they are part of a masculine or feminine word. 

# 4. Conclusion

Now to finish this post I’d like to look at a Vastayan sentence and translate it to Ionian to look at the differences. 

Vastayan 

    faash  vastaya  na
faːʃ   ʋɑstaja  na
they   vastaya  be.not 
    ‘They are not-vastaya’

Ionian

    aazo      vastta   okh    ruan-kkē
ɑːzo      θɑstjɑ   ox     ruɑnkje
they.NAT  vastaya  stand  together-NEG
‘They     are not  Vastaya’

Even though the languages are similar, the sentences are very different. The biggest difference are the verbs, since the particle structure in Ionian changes how the sentence works. Another interesting part is how the word for Vastaya has changed over time. Ionian can’t pronounce the ‘v’ and use a ‘th’ sound instead. The ‘taya’ part has also merged together to ‘tya.’

That was all for now, I hoped you enjoyed this sneak peak into Vastayan. 

Cheers,

ekv85z|2020-01-06 15:01:46|Power of macro play|"So, the thing happened yesterday, but before i get to it, lemme tell some backstory.

Im a casual normie who plays nothing but TFT, ARAM and normal drafts as a support. As for ranked, i did like 13 games during season7 and no more than 10 during season8, getting silver4 and bronze2 respectively. Currently i would consider myself as a low silver at best, and my laning basically sucks, plus i only play for fun and ranked is just too stressing to me. Why tell all this, well, i just wanted to clarify that what im about to tell is a BIG thing in my eyes, probably for other low elo players too, even though it might look like a basic stuff for a high elo player.

To set the scene, my team is Jax, Hecarim, Swain, Varus and Nami, with Nami being me and Jax being a friend. Enemy team is Renekton, Dr. Mundo, Kassadin, Xayah and Soraka. Around the end of laning phase, Renek and Mundo getting fed a bit scarily, mid is even with Kassadin just waiting to reach lv16 spike, bot is slightly in our favor as Xayah and Soraka sucked lane phase. We have no drakes vs enemy having 3 waiting to claim Infernal Soul. Hecarim seems to have no idea about objective control, Jax having some kills without much indication that he has an idea to snowball his kills, Varus feels like he's fed up and starts a sur which fails 3/2. The game is now slightly past 21mins, enemy just acquired their final drake, the fate appears to be our defeat.

Then somehow i managed to get majority of team to group around Baron, scoring a few picks into taking it, only to lose a few members during the next teamfight, though we still got more kills so it was good. At that point, two members admit getting tilted, however i managed to get them up. By that point, im also starting lose positivity, but also realizing enemy is likely to throw it, sharing all of it with team. Thanks to Baron buff, we manage to score some pushes, Elder spawn closes in, i get to align team again for it, we get a good fight followed by taking the objective. Meanwhile, Jax was pretty much always taking it solo, mostly ending up getting collapsed. Which at some point got over me, after calling team to group up, i let an ""especially you Jax"" following with him asking ""why"" and thankfully, THANKFULLY Hecarim mentioning that he has most kills, which finally makes him decide to join in.

Now it really starts to turn, having Elder buff with about to expire Baron we get a really good fight, blow mid inhib and even take a nexus turret. Anyway, second Baron spawn closes in, and guess who got to react my call. HECARIM. After letting enemy take 4 drakes with no competition ever, showing severe lack of map awareness and decision making, he nailed a sick follow up and came right with me, Swain also following. Jax and Varus stayed at enemy base for a while, probably to keep them in check(risky play but worked) while we got the Baron. After that, we rotated to Elder as whole team, and no competition from enemy team, we just took it, then proceeded straight into finishing the job. I just can't explain the satisfaction i got after typing ""power of macro play baby"" on post-game, damn was that the moment.

TL;DR, my team was behind with enemy team having their Renek and Mundo fed plus Kassadin scaling up with infernal soul, teammates getting tilted and the end approaching. Through attitude and macro shotcalling, got my team to eventually comeback with two Barons and two Elders.

So, why i had to share this, ultimately showing off? Well, i have always seen guides talking about the power of macro play, however this was the first time i fully experienced to pull it off. As a support, a role famous for being team dependant, through sheer force of attitude, i prevented them from getting seriously tilted and shotcalled our way to enemy nexus. What i want to emphasize here is two things, actually it's three things; attitude, attitude, and macro. 

Always keep your mind up, and even if you can't do it, look like you're up. During my game, i was pissed for so many things, but with the exception of ""especially you Jax"" i have NEVER showed a sign of negativity, even when expressing a negative opinion, always countered it with a positive point, which kept everyone in shape. That's what you need to keep in mind, if you don't want someone to screw it. Even just saying ""chill"" or ""calm down"" has a big effect, reminding teammates that a throw can always happen or there's always ways to snatch the comeback(especially if you can land a successfull shotcall after that) will keep the morale up and prevent massive tilt sprees. Teammates might be doing mistakes, and it's alright to tell them, BUT, do it in a friendly way. ""Get the freaking drake already you bronze crap"" will guarantee that you won't have jungler, but a ""hey, we really need your help for drakes"" has a high chance of your jungle getting along. In my game, i actually told Hecarim that he lacks map awareness and decision making, but by doing it in a friendly way, also through some luck timing it right after he admits being bad, within minutes i got an objective seeking jungler.

And, as for macro, if you find yourself prepping for a siege while Baron is up, think ""what would happen if we siege with Baron buff?"". Now you know you need Baron and to get that you need your team to get along. Make good use of attitude, set up Baron, take it, then take a few seconds to decide what would be the best next move. Lead your team while making sure you're landing solid decisions. To be honest, im still a kind of macro noob, my best advice would be to check countless macro guides to arm you to the best. I mostly won my game by attitude, using macro play as a tool.

And as for final words, i thank you all for reading this far. It took an hour and some minutes to write it on mobile, im hoping that i didn't waste a whole bunch of your time. Im just a bronze casual normie who wanted to share their ""big success"" with you, and hopefully up your enjoyment and winrate at least the slightest.

ekpqm2|2020-01-06 05:53:55|%12 total buff for junglers, actually it is not a nerf hurr durr|"That is one of the most stupid statements i have ever seen in this game and people write this probably never play jungle.

Right now even with fastest clearers, you CAN NOT clear all your camps given that even if you have no issue with your hp-mana which you actually have with almost all junglers.  You clear all your camps, including 1 scuttle and let's assume that there were not any skirmish for scuttle or gank or something. Then you go back, get your items and boom 2 of your camps already spawned and you were not there to clear it so technically you wasted your time by not being there even though you were %100 committed for jungle clearing.

Before, when the camps were not spawning fast, you could clear it all, and at exact 4:32 minute mark you could be at your golems(assuming you start from red,golems and chickens) to catch their spawn time and keep going. By the time your red buff spawns second time, you would be lvl 6 or close to 6, again, without any gank, scuttle skirmish or whatnot.

Now there is LITERALLY no scenario that you can reach lvl 6 with your second buff timer unless you ganked a lane, your laner die and you soak the whole wave or something. In fact in some cases you can not reach 6 EVEN AFTER you get your second second buff. Now imagine if you actually did bad or things went wrong with a counter gank, well have fun with not existing for 10 minute in the game. 

So basically your success or at least catching up with laners depend on failure of your laners so you can steal their resources. How ironic is that huh?

Especially when he shoves the wave into my turret, he uses Windwall so the minions die to my turret and not to me.

I am losing significant CS and gold because of it.

In addition, his Windwall allows him to safely stack his Q under my turret, and then fire his tornadoes...which go through Windwall, further poking and zoning me from CS.

It is hard to get him to use his Windwall for more defensive purposes because his passive shield makes him immune to most poke and burst.

I feel like there are so many well designed abilities and mechanics in the game that make it fun, but dealing with things as frustrating as this really make me just want to stop playing League. The consistent blatant favoritism toward high-selling champions just makes me lose all respect for the game's integrity."|john58129343|False|https://redd.it/ekzkdf|2|0.67|0|12|1|leagueoflegends

Are we only getting 3 VGU's this year too? or will it be more of a 50/50 split? A lot of champions still need to have their kits reworked and pumping out champions more often will hurt the balance much more with so many outdated kits still around.

People that do this are the reason why this game is becoming more and more intolerable for me. 

Get off your high horse and stop flaming. I don't care if the person is 0 - 15 you say nothing and carry the f*** on with the game.

el09q8|2020-01-06 21:02:43|Champion kit #4, a Catcher (physical)|"Hello you people, have a good 2020. I'm FúrinKazan and, although a level 10 account, I'm actually close to 400 in the BR server. I recently tried to reach out to Riot about my projects for League of Legends, but unfortunately they only deal with graduated people.

Anyway, the projects I made for the game have no use anymore so I decided to publish them all. They are champion kits, counting up to **120** with unique abilities, defined classes, gameplay and numbers for those who like. The idea is to publish one champion per day until **April**. I also have some champion updades and they might show up sometimes.

I see a lot of good and creative kit concepts and reworks everywhere on the internet. However, if its gameplay is not coherent, it's not a champion. If numbers are not right, it won't work. Riot abandons a lot of cool fantasies because they end up failing at executon, so I bring you the abilities instead, for people to imagine a theme as they want. Here we go:

&#x200B;

* Iehisa Shimazu (names are merely for inpiration and representation). Designed to be a physical and more interactive Catcher.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Passive:** Every few seconds, Iehisa dispatches a small ambush unit to hide in nearby terrain in a certain position. When an enemy enters its range, the unit attacks after a brief delay, **stunning** for **1.25** seconds all enemies hit within a line towards the ambushed enemy. Hitting an enemy champion grants **Turnaround**.

Iehisa may position as many units as possible, as long as there is a minimum distance between them. They last for up to **35** seconds and, after trying to perform an ambush, will disappear and won't hide in the same place for a certain time. They also disappear when Iehisa moves too far away.

**Turnaround:** Iehisa's next basic attack or **3rd Skill**'s cast within **3** seconds deals additional damage and heals him by a certain value if used against an ambushed enemy champion. Additionally, the **3rd Skill**'s **Cooldown** is completely reseted. Cannot happen again within a few seconds.

**-Ambush unit downtime: 16/15/14/13/12 seconds**  
**-Additional damage: 10% AD (+ 8/9/10/11/12 (+ 3% AD)% of target's Maximum Health) as Physical Damage**  
**-Heal: 60/75/90/105/120 (+ 40% Bonus AD), increasing by 1% for every 1% of Maximum Health missing**  
**-Cooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds**

Values at levels **1/5/9/13/17.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**1st Skill:** Iehisa attacks with his spear within a line towards the selected direction within **0.5** second, dealing damage and reducing the **Armor** of enemies hit for **3** seconds. Within **3** seconds, Iehisa may reactivate the ability to repeat the movement (the **Armor** reduction accumulates).

Within another **3** seconds, the ability can be reactivated a last time, causing Iehisa to strike with his spear within a conical area in front of himself within **0.5** second. Enemies hit take damage and are **slowed** by **40%** for **1.5** seconds.

During the movements, Iehisa can move slowly and each one of them can be followed up with a basic attack.

**-Damage (1st and 2nd uses): 20/40/60/80/100 (+ 40% Bonus AD) as Physical Damage**  
**-Damage (3rd use): 50/80/110/140/170 (+ 70% Bonus AD) as Physical Damage**  
**-Armor reduction (per use): 6/8/10/12/14%**  
**-CD: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds (begins after 3 seconds or the last move)**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**2nd Skill:** Iehisa throws his spear towards the targeted direction, dealing damage to all enemies it passes through and stopping at its end. The spear sticks to the last enemy hit, **slowing him** and decaying over **2** seconds. Hitting him with a basic attack or strike of the **1st Skill** deals additional damage and **roots** for **1.5** seconds.

If no enemy is hit, the spear fixes itself on the ground at the end of the line for up to **3** seconds, sticking to the first enemy to enter contact with it, applying the aforementioned effects.

**-Damage (throw): 40/70/100/130/160 (+ 60% Bonus AD) as Physical Damage**  
**-Slow: 40/50/60/70/80%**  
**-Additional damage: 20/45/70/95/120 (+ 40% Bonus AD) as Physical Damage**  
**-CD: 14/13/12/11/10 seconds**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**3rd Skill:** Iehisa advances towards the targeted enemy, dealing damage and granting himself additional **Attack Speed** for **3** seconds. While under the effect of **Turnaround**, the ability gains some additional effects (damage, healing and total **Cooldown** reset).

Jumping towards an enemy champion immediately positions an ambush unit in a nearby terrain (also works with the reset).

**-Damage: 40/65/90/115/140 (+ 30% Bonus AD) as Physical Damage**  
**-Additional Attack Speed: 25/30/35/40/45%**  
**-CD: 14/13/12/11/10 seconds**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Ultimate:** Iehisa commands a unit to surprise his enemies from behind. Selects a nearby position from where a unit of soldiers appears and advances a certain distance towards Iehisa, dealing damage and **pushing** enemies hit towards the same direction.

Enemy champions **pushed** by the movement that are hit by a **Passive**'s ambush take damage and are **stunned** for an additional **0.5** second.

**-Damage (initial): 100/150/200 (+ 60% Bonus AD) as Physical Damage**  
**-Damage (ambush): 150/225/300 (+ 120% Bonus AD) as Physical Damage**  
**-CD: 100/80/60 seconds**

I propose Yasuo's Wind Wall should have a health bar. The health bar depletes when hit with auto attacks/abilities and it eventually disappears after receiving a certain damage threshold

ekzkdf|2020-01-06 20:13:49|Using Yasuo Windwall to block me from Cannon/CS|"Every time I lane against Yasuo as a ranged champion, he will use Windwall to prevent me from last-hitting Cannon minion and other CS.

Especially when he shoves the wave into my turret, he uses Windwall so the minions die to my turret and not to me.

I am losing significant CS and gold because of it.

In addition, his Windwall allows him to safely stack his Q under my turret, and then fire his tornadoes...which go through Windwall, further poking and zoning me from CS.

It is hard to get him to use his Windwall for more defensive purposes because his passive shield makes him immune to most poke and burst.
________________

I'm really not sure what I'm supposed to do against this. **Why can a melee champion, under the enemy turret, deny farm from a ranged champion *with a defensive ability*?**

I feel like there are so many well designed abilities and mechanics in the game that make it fun, but dealing with things as frustrating as this really make me just want to stop playing League. The consistent blatant favoritism toward high-selling champions just makes me lose all respect for the game's integrity."|john58129343|False|https://redd.it/ekzkdf|1|0.67|0|12|1|leagueoflegends

Aphelios' Arsenal:  
A Beginner's Guide 
___

By DM Shaman


INTRODUCTION

Hey all, Shaman here! Aphelios recently released on public servers, so I just wanted to give a quick rundown on his weapons and how they interact with one another. In this guide I'll just be going over weapon synergies, but if this post receives enough momentum, I'll release a full guide in the near future.
Aphelios' kit certainly seems daunting at first glance, but with enough practice and game knowledge you can definitely play him to his full potential. First, let's start off with the weapons and their attributes.

Calibrum, the Rifle

￼

Calibrum is one of the two weapons Aphelios starts with for every game. Its increased range compared to the rest of his weapons makes it excellent for poking and pushing enemies early in the game.
Calibrum Attribute: Enemies marked by Calibrum can be attacked at any range to be dealt bonus damage from the mark and Aphelios' offhand weapon.

Severum, the Pistol 

￼

Severum is the second starting weapon Aphelios has every game. While it may not look like one, it is in fact a pistol. Due to its Q ability and limited range, Severum is meant to be used in close encounters and to burst down any enemies that get too close. 
Severum Attribute: Severum provides a passive lifesteal per attack and even gives a shield when you are overhealed. This is an excellent way to get a shield at the very start of the game if you decide to leash for your jungler by attacking the buff and going straight to lane. 

Gravitum, the Cannon

￼

With it's medium range, relatively higher damage output, and passive ability, Gravitum is great for hindering enemies in more ways than one. While you can't use its ability without the passive being applied, this makes it even more effective as an offhand weapon.
Gravitum Attribute: Gravitum applies a slow when basic attacking, similar to Ashe's passive. However, enemies hit by Gravitum are marked and made susceptible to its Q, which roots them all simultaneously.

Infernum, the Flamethrower

￼

Infernum has great wave clear potential thanks to its AOE damage and Q ability. It's also the best weapon Aphelios has to apply offhand weapon passives, like marks and/or bomus damage.
Infernum Attribute: Infernum's basic attacks pierce its initial target and fire multiple smaller projectiles in a wave behind them. This is excellent for gaining quick creep kills and kiting the enemy laners even when they're sitting behind wave.

Crescendum, the Chakram

￼

Crescendum is interesting in the sense that the closer you are to your target, the faster your attack speed is. Stand farther away, and it'll take longer for it to return so you can attack again. With its passive and Q ability, this weapon is a great harassment tool.
Crescendum Attribute: When you land attacks with Crescendum as your offhand weapon, you gain more chakrams that circle you and deal bonus damage when you use it as your on-hand weapon. Rack up enough chakrams and you'll be dealing huge amounts of damage per basic attack.

Weapon Synergies: Better Together

With five unique weapons and ten (or is it twenty?) different combinations, it may seem like a challenge to determine the best possible outcome for each situation. In this section, I'll be breaking down how these weapons work in tandem with one another, and how to use them to the greatest effect. Let's list off the combos:

Calibrum + Severum
Calibrum + Gravitum
Calibrum + Infernum
Calibrum + Crescendum
Severum + Gravitum
Severum + Infernum
Severum + Crescendum
Gravitum + Infernum
Gravitum + Crescendum
Infernum + Crescendum

Awesome! Now we have that out of the way, the next part will go into detail about how certain weapons work with each other. (Note: I'll be describing the weapons' effects as on-hand and off-hand weapons.)

Calibrum (On-hand) + Severum (Off-hand): Landing the Q with Calibrum will let you mark a single enemy. Follow up by clicking on them to deal bonus damage through the mark and Severum's off-hand attack, which will also apply lifesteal.

Severum (On-hand) + Calibrum (Off-hand): Use Severum's Q to close the gap between you and the enemy champion(s) - rely on the movement speed bonus and increased rate of lifesteal to burst them down. Calibrum's mark will be applied to all enemies hit, so choose the target you want to deal the bonus damage to and click them wherever they are.

Calibrum (On-hand) + Gravitum (Off-hand): Marking an enemy with Calibrum's Q, then activating the mark, will apply a Gravitum mark as part of the activation. Use this opportunity to switch to Gravitum and activate its Q to root your target. 

Calibrum (On-hand) + Infernum (Off-hand): Mark the enemy with Calibrum's Q, then activate the mark to follow up with Infernum's burst effect. This is a great way to deal damage to a greater number of enemies at a farther distance.

Infernum (On-hand) + Calibrum (Off-hand): Infernum's Q shoots out a cone of flame that applies the off-hand weapon to all enemies damaged by it, thereby applying Calibrum's mark to said enemies. Click any one of them to consume the mark. 

Calibrum (On-hand) + Crescendum (Off-hand): Mark an enemy with Calbrum's Q and then attack them to apply bonus damage and gain an extra chakram for when you switch to Crescendum and use it for basic attacks.

Crescendum (On-hand) + Calibrum (Off-hand): Throw down a Calibrum turret using Crescendum's Q and let it mark enemies while you kite around. Once you pick a target, attack them to consume Calibrum's mark from any distance. 

Severum (On-hand) + Gravitum (Off-hand): Use Severum's Q to apply Gravitum's mark to all targets hit by the ability. Then you can switch to Gravitum and activate its Q  root them, leaving them immobile.

Severum (On-hand) + Infernum (Off-hand): Using Severum's Q applies Infernum's flame burst to every enemy hit by the ability. This is a great tool to wave clear and gain back a good amount of health at the same time. 

Infernum (On-hand) + Severum (Off-hand): All  enemies blasted by Infernum's Q are also attacked by Severum as a follow up. Be sure to hit as many targets as possible with the flame to maximize your damage output.

Severum (On-hand) + Crescendum (Off-hand): Severum's Q allows you to gain additional chakram for Crescendum per enemy hit. Dive into a wave of minions and rack them up to increase Crescendum's basic attack damage.

Crescendum (On-hand) + Severum (Off-hand): Use Crescendum's Q to throw down a Severum turret. It doesn't attack very quickly, but you still gain its passive lifesteal.

Infernum (On-hand) + Gravitum (Off-hand): Use Infernum's Q to apply Gravitum's mark to multiple enemies, then switch to Gravitum to activate its Q and root/damage them. This is the best combination in Aphelios' kit to immobilize multiple enemies at once.

Crescendum (On-hand) + Gravitum (Off-hand): Use Crescendum's Q to put up a Gravitum turret that applies its mark to all enemies damaged by it. Because Crescendum turrets prioritize champions, be sure to place them where enemy champions are heading to get the greatest benefit. Once they're marked, switch to Gravitum and use its Q to root them.

Infernum (On-hand) + Crescendum (Off-hand): Hit multiple enemies with Infernum's Q and gain an additional chakram per hit. More targets means more chakrams for Crescendum's basic attacks, so use this for team fights and to clear waves quickly.

Crescendum (On-hand) + Infernum (Off-hand): Activate Crescendum's Q to erect an Infernum turret. Then you can switch to Infernum and maximize your AOE damage potential by using the weapon's basic attacks and the turret's attacks as well. 

And that's all of them! Always be sure to use your E to keep an eye on your next weapon, as each combination is best suited for different maneuvers and strategies. With this in mind, and all the tips above, you'll get the hang of Aphelios in no time. "|shamanbahman|False|https://redd.it/ekzesr|0|0.5|0|4|1|leagueoflegends

[8:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd9R5M8BPiY&t=508s) \- (wave manipulation) Farm and why we lose it after lane

As a general rule of thumb, try to think of how many seconds it will take people to reach something, and plan fights or pushes around how long it will take to return to the lane or area of relevance. It takes 37 seconds to get to center of lane from base in bot lane.

In early game its almost always better to set a freeze (4+casters) instead of trying to get a wave to tower, because death timers are so short. Death timers increase by 2 seconds per level in pre-6.

When trying to dodge something, just think about the hitboxes and walk in the faster perpendicular to the skillshot.

Remember to not stand within 300\~ units of your support as well, unless you are playing against an assassin like Kha'zix.

Look around the map and plan for waves \~2 minutes in advance after laning phase if you can.  It will completely change how you think about the game and your cs/min will go up a ton.  Just learning that can help you climb so much.

ekxxxu|2020-01-06 18:20:57|In his current state, Nautilus doesn't belong in the bot lane.|"As a support main who abused Nautilus in season 9 I have a few concerns with him being a ""support.""

He has 4 ccs in his Kit: 

Passive: auto attack that snares 

Q: hook then pulls you closer to him and him closer to you 

E: AoE slow where the center of the radius is himself

R: a point and click knock up that knocks other up as it goes to you

Another problem with Naut is that he can solo and adc in the early game and if ahead, he will solo the enemy adc all game. His base damage numbers are quite high and he's a tank ""support"" 

My friends have an inside joke of ""Imagine missing Nautilus hooks"" we have that because the fact that the hit box on his Q isnt consistent, you can get hit by that hook when it 100% shouldn't have.  

Now if Riot wants Naut to be a support, that's fine, I really love playing hook champs, but in his current state, he isnt healthy for the lane and he often 1v2s the lane. If you're against a Naut you have to hope and pray your jungler comes and saves you or else you are losing that lane. They need to address this champion because he is currently unhealthy for the bot lane meta."|Supret|False|https://redd.it/ekxxxu|0|0.51|0|19|1|leagueoflegends

ekvydk|2020-01-06 15:57:32|A Larger Discussion on Dominion, Twisted Treeline, and RGM's|"I've seen some discussions here (relatively) recently about how much people miss ""for fun"" game modes in League and how much people want them back. I'd consider myself one of those people (specifically as a Dominion player) and lately I've been going crazy with wondering why these modes had to go away. I'll get into my own reasons for missing/wanting these modes to come back, but in order to generate a more productive overarching discussion, I wanted to ask people:

&#x200B;

* what they liked/disliked about these modes?
* why they did or did not play them?
* why did they not gain or retain a larger player base?
* and lastly, why is it a problem for Riot to keep them around anyways?

&#x200B;

I wanted to share some my perspective and experience as a (really) long time fan of League and why I'm having a harder and harder time feeling like I have a place in LoL lately. 

&#x200B;

If you want, you can skip this part and just contribute to the discussion by answering these questions.

&#x200B;

I'd consider myself a ""hardcore"" player that enjoys friendly competition. However, I have a really hard time handling any flame or feeling like I'm letting my team down. It was easier when I used to have friends to play League with, but they've all mostly moved on to other games, or have outstripped me in rank so badly that I can't really play with them or I almost single-handedly lose the game for my team. I used to play this game religiously beginning around S2 and before I took a long break, I used to feel like I could carry my own weight. But after I took that long break, it's been really hard to get back into the game without re-experiencing those growing pains and honestly, it's been a huge deterrent for being able to consistently enjoy the game. 

&#x200B;

This is where Dominion came in. After my friends were starting to trickle down on their League time, Summoner's Rift became too stressful for me. There were other issues I had with it, but I'd say that was the main one. So I tried out Dominion and it instantly grew on me. It provided the perfect alternative to SR for me. The skills that I'd gained on Summoner's Rift were easily transferable and it provided a new and exciting way to play the game where I could actually pick my champion and it wasn't so straightforward that it didn't become too repetitive (ARAM). There were a lot of viable strategies to try out (at least at my level). Tankier champions could not only provide CC and durability for their team, but also act as an zone of control while their teammates captured points. Supports had actual gold income and could provide their teams with utility and had interesting ways to interrupt capture channeling, giving time for your team to catch up to a point to contest it. Assassins could make important picks that would delay the enemy team's assault on your points. ADC's and Mages brought the damage and a variety of playstyles depending on the champions chosen and could also provide other things that I mentioned above. Wave control, poke, engage, tower diving, teamfighting, map control, ganking, rotations, macro, micro; these things were all present in Dominion, providing a stimulating experience that never got stale for me. And when I did get occasionally burned out on Dominion, I would play Summoner's Rift and do alright because they shared a lot of the same skills and had the same champions. 

&#x200B;

After Dominion was removed, I was still able to find a place in LoL through occasional Twisted Treeline and RGM's and even though they weren't as fun for me, they provided enough reason to stick around and had a similar effect where it made me want to play Summoner's Rift too for that variety of playing the game in different ways. When Definitely Not Dominion came out, I did appreciate the effort, but it really missed the mark IMO, and demonstrated a lack of understanding of what made the mode appealing to Dominion players. The removal of the bot lane removed a huge chunk of the strategy in Dominion and removed a lot of gameplay options. Even though these modes weren't as fun for me, they kept me around. But even those have been removed.

&#x200B;

I love this game. I love the art, music, SFX, VFX, character design, gameplay design, and the universe that Riot has created and appreciate the passion and care that Riot puts into this game. I love catching up on the lore and reading about how Riot goes through the process behind their decision making, whether it's thematic or gameplay focused. I love how they've been transparent about what they've learned what players want and need over the years. There have been bumps in the road and grievances for everyone I think, but I don't think that I would keep trying so hard to get back into the game if I didn't really care about it. I'm going to keep trying because I want to enjoy the game, but it's not easy. I guess you could say that if I really have THIS hard a time enjoying the game, then I just shouldn't play it. But my needs as a player used to be met by the game, but the ways they were met have been removed, and now, I'm struggling about knowing what to do.

&#x200B;

I don't want to pretend that these modes were more popular then they actually were; the data doesn't lie. But I'm also not gonna lie, I really miss these modes. And thanks to my current dilemma, it's hard to feel like I really have a home in LoL."|OppoGuy|False|https://redd.it/ekvydk|0|0.5|0|2|1|leagueoflegends

ejxz2d|2020-01-04 15:31:59|I deciphered the math behind Omnistone|"&#x200B;

So ever since it was mentioned that **Dark harvest stacks amplify the power of all keystones**, it definitely caught\* my interest but I couldn’t find any information on it anywhere so I decided to do the math myself. I’ll add all the details in the end, like math formulas, charts and examples.

Some might think that I’m crazy to waste so much time on a nearly useless keystone that only few champions can use but I’m optimistic that eventually it will be a popular keystone; I'll drop a separate post in the upcoming days on an interesting and fairly simple idea concept which would solve the core problems omnistone has without ruining it’s identity.

Edit: I was taught to use commas for decimals and generally it's not something uncommon.

Edit: Confirmed to be accurate by Riot \[ [https://prnt.sc/qjgi9d](https://prnt.sc/qjgi9d) \] BIG shout-out to **GreaterBelugaWhale !!!**

Edit: I took all the info from League wiki and NOT leaguepedia, my bad (careless error thanks to overheated brain).

Edit: It's on the wiki now, GG [https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Prototype:\_Omnistone](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Prototype:_Omnistone)

&#x200B;

Quick rundown of how it works:

**Dark Harvest (DH)**

Every DH stack increases it’s damage by **5** like normally and also amplifies the power of all other keystones.

**Conqueror**

Every DH stack increases Conqueror’s base power by **2,5%** *(both AP and AD)*. 15% healing at 10 stacks doesn’t increase.

**Aftershock**

Every DH stack increases base resist buff by **2,5%** and also the item bonus resist percentage (80%) by **2,5%**.

Aftershock’s damage gets increased by **3,75** for each DH stack.

**Grasp of the Undying**

Every DH stack increases damage and healing multipliers by **\~** **3,333334%**. *(Check details for more information.)*

Every DH stack increases permanent health gain on each grasp proc by **5%**, previous ones too. *(That’s why it might seem like DH stacks would increase maximum health sometimes.)*

**Phase Rush**

Each DH stack increases base movement speed bonus and base slow resist (75%) by **5%**.

**Lethal Tempo**

Every DH stack increases base attack speed percentage by **5%**.

**Glacial Augment**

Every DH stack increases base slow percentage by **2,5%**.

**Fleet Footwork**

Every DH stack increases healing by **5** and also the 1 second MS bonus by **5%**.

**Hail of Blades**

Every DH stack increases base attack speed percentage by **5%**.

**PTA**

Every DH stack increases damage by **10**. Exposure percentage doesn’t increase.

**Predator**

Every DH stack increases damage by **5**. Bonus MS percentage doesn’t increase.

**Summon Aery**

Every DH stack increases damage and shielding by **5**.

**Electrocute**

Every DH stack increases damage by **5**.

**Comet**

Every DH stack increases damage by **5**.

&#x200B;

**Omnistone’s “smart” logic**

Probability to roll a ‘priority’ keystone is around **5 - 7% \~ higher** compared to the non-priority keystones, depending on how many keystones are available & prioritized based on 5000 rolls with different setups.

Edit: Rioter reached out to me and explained the mechanic behind it which should result in the probability of ""priority"" keystones being around 7% higher compared to non-priority ones because initially it shouldn't be possible to roll the same keystone in the next 5 rolls but I definitely kept rolling the same keystones sometimes when it shouldn't be possible so I based the 5% \~ on that. I can confirm that sometimes it was slightly higher but I thought that was just minor RNG fluctuation. He mentioned that there might be some scripting errors. Either way the average was leaning towards being below 6% when I was looking at the whole picture of it but other than that it works like it should.

Summary by (other) Rioter of how the keystones are prioritized: [https://gyazo.com/2353b1d7fa53934d1ddc3f16269729d3](https://gyazo.com/2353b1d7fa53934d1ddc3f16269729d3)

**Details, charts, math formulas and examples for skeptics and brave souls :)**

I don’t expect almost anyone to read this part through but it had to be done for credibility and to show that the math actually works. I spent probably closer to 150 hours on this project, mostly on double checking the numbers so all of this is based on huge amount of data and not just couple runs in practice tool. I had to figure out some of the key game mechanics because most data in practice tool was very inconsistent and wouldn’t had formed a clear pattern.

All stats are rounded down before point 5 mark (75,499 \~ 75) and rounded up after they reach point 5 mark *(75,5 \~ 76)* **except health**, which rounds up at any decimal rate *(3400,01 \~ 3401)*.

Damage texts are rounded down in every scenario at any decimal rate *(73,999 \~ 73).*

Even though most stats are rounded, the decimal values remain same so they have to be taken in account whenever doing calculations.

Most of the formulas on league wiki page are rounded to 3 decimals which can result in calculation errors but very rarely, practically less than 1/1000.

&#x200B;

**(AP) Conqueror**

The single stack value formulas on wiki page are inaccurate, mostly because everything on the site is rounded on 3 decimals. AP stack formula is **1,824 + 0,176 x level** on site and there were ton of mistakes with it but the formula shown on 10 stacks is **18,235 + 1,765 x level** and dividing it by 10 to get the single stack value formula ended up giving the correct values in 99,999% of the cases. I am also 100% positive that it runs even deeper than that based on what I found but that is irrelevant here. Bottom line is that the base values are increased by 2,5% for each DH stack.

(SS from official wiki page how ""same"" formulas are different:[ https://gyazo.com/8152077d10bca3fa4ea896a44a6c9d52](https://gyazo.com/8152077d10bca3fa4ea896a44a6c9d52))

(wrong formula vs ‘right’ formula:[ https://gyazo.com/9fb0b536fa0e3c0ec443bc8690f5ffac](https://gyazo.com/9fb0b536fa0e3c0ec443bc8690f5ffac))

Stack base value: 1,8235 + 0,1765 x level (League Wiki)

Math formula: (Conqueror stack + (Conqueror stack x 0,025 x DH stacks)) x amount of stacks

Chart: (not rounded)[ https://gyazo.com/366c2d58876a829cfea3d5a54214d669](https://gyazo.com/366c2d58876a829cfea3d5a54214d669)

&#x200B;

**(AD) Conqueror**

Stack base value: 1.0941 + 0.1059 x level (League Wiki)

Since most champions don’t have a flat base AD, I had to take the decimals into account to form a pattern and even if they had flat base AD, it changes on every champion in the game as they level up. The difference can be very small but it can ruin the correct pattern and calculation.

Math formula: (stack base value + stack base value x 0,025 x DH stacks) x amount of stacks

Chart: (not rounded)[ https://gyazo.com/cf9e836efdd5a20290f54d1e0a5e787b](https://gyazo.com/cf9e836efdd5a20290f54d1e0a5e787b)

&#x200B;

**Aftershock**

Every DH stack increases Aftershock’s base resist buff by 2,5% and also the item bonus resist percentage (80%) by 2,5%.

Base value is 35 for both armor and MR.

Math formulas:

**base resist bonus**: 35 + (35 x 0,025 x DH stacks)

**bonus resists from items**: resists from items x (0,80 + (0,80 x 0,025 x DH stacks))

&#x200B;

Example: Level 16 Kennen, 83,28 + 40 bonus armor & 37,24 + 25 bonus MR, 4 DH stacks

armor: 35 + (35 x 0,025 x 4) + (40 x (0,80 + 0,80 x 0,025 x 4)) = **73,7 armor** (+ 123,28 armor = 197,98 \~ **total** **198 armor**)

MR: 35 + (35 x 0,025 x 4) + (25 x (0,80 + 0,80 x 0,025 x 4)) = **60,5 MR** (+ 62,24 MR = 122,74MR \~ **total** **123 MR**)

*Bonus resistances are capped at 80 - 150 depending on your level.*

Aftershock’s damage base damage: 19,412 + 5,588 x level + 8% of bonus health. (League Wiki)

The damage based on different total health amounts didn’t increase in any way no matter how many stacks I had so it can only be that the pattern is **3,75** damage flat per DH stack. I have no idea why it is like that considering how other keystones work but it just seems to be right.

&#x200B;

**Grasp of the Undying**

It is impossible to pin-point the absolute correct value because of total health limitations but I managed to narrow it down to 5 decimals, between 0,033333...34 < **\[multiplier\]** \> 0,03333342. I’ll be using **0,0333334** as the multiplier since I didn’t find single mistake with it out of hundreds of different calculations. Riot probably had some kind of simple way to calculate the final variable like 0,04 / 3 or 0,024 / 3 but I can’t say for sure. Likely there is a mistake but it would be lower than 0,000001 and practically it won’t affect the outcome. I don’t know why it has very different formula compared to other keystones but it just seems to work no matter what health total I pick with different amounts of DH stacks.

How I arrived at the numbers above:[ https://gyazo.com/753297461256ba213eab109999e107fd](https://gyazo.com/753297461256ba213eab109999e107fd)

Healing values fluctuate a lot because sometimes the bonus health is added before the healing text so instead of healing 47, it might show that grasp healed only 42. Also health regen seems to affect the numbers because I did a run without single DH stack *(so only flat values on grasp)* and it would still fluctuate like that. I got values like 46, 51, 52, 46, **51** in row; the bigger jumps are from permanent health ‘bug’ and smaller *(52 - 51)* changes can be explained only with health regen but it is always ½ of the damage dealt so it’s easy to calculate and all the data supports that.

**\[Melee\]** Damage **(4%)** and healing **(2%)** percentages are increased by \~ 3,33334% for each DH stack.

Math formulas:

**Damage**: total health x (0,04 + (0,04 x 0,0333334 x DH stacks))

**Healing**: total health x (0,02 + (0,02 x 0,0333334 x DH stacks))

&#x200B;

Example: Level 11 Amumu, base health 1350,22 (+ 2000 health), 3 DH stacks & 10 grasp procs

total health: (1350,22 + 2000 + 10 x (5 + (5 x 0,05 x 3)) = **3407,72**

damage vs 0 resists: 3407,72 x (0,04 + (0,04 x 0,0333334 x 3) = 149,93... **\~ 149**

damage vs target dummy (50% resists): 149,9397072618 / 2 = 74,96... **\~ 74**

&#x200B;

*Every DH stack increases permanent health gain on each grasp proc by 5%, previous ones too.*

Math formulas:

**Grasp bonus health**: 5 + (5 x 0,05 x DH stacks)

**DH stack bonus heath**: grasp proc amount x (5 x 0,05)

**Total bonus health**: grasp proc amount x (5 + (5 x 0,05 x DH stacks))

example:[ https://gyazo.com/2304fa6942dfb9753cb7650659017612](https://gyazo.com/2304fa6942dfb9753cb7650659017612)

&#x200B;

**\[Ranged\]** Damage **(2,4%)** and healing **(1,2%)** percentages are increased by \~ 3,33334% for each DH stack.

Math formulas:

**Damage**: total health x (0,024 + (0,024 x 0,0333334 x DH stacks))

**Healing**: total health x (0,012 + (0,012 x 0,0333334 x DH stacks))

Example: Level 16 Teemo, 1830,75 base health (+ 1300 health), 6 DH stacks & 6 grasp procs

total health: 1830,75 + 1300 + 6 x (3 + (3 x 0,05 x 6) = **3154,15**

damage vs 0 resists: 3154,15 x (0,024 + (0,024 x 0,0333334 x 6)) = 93,71... **\~ 93**

damage vs target dummy (50% resists): 93,7195512398 / 2 = 46,85... **\~ 46**

&#x200B;

*Every DH stack increases permanent health gain on each grasp proc by 5%, previous ones too.*

Math formulas:

**Grasp bonus health**: 3 + (3 x 0,05 x DH stacks)

**DH stack bonus heath**: grasp proc amount x (3 x 0,05)

**Total bonus health**: grasp proc amount x (3 + (3 x 0,05 x DH stacks))

example:[ https://gyazo.com/02a5f89b17206a0aaf4b493db0fe542d](https://gyazo.com/02a5f89b17206a0aaf4b493db0fe542d)

&#x200B;

**Phase Rush**

Base value: 24,118% + 0,882% x level (25 - 40%, League Wiki)

There are two soft caps for high ms values, **they are applied only after slows** (League Wiki);

1st soft cap: when MS is 415 ≤ but ≤ 490, the soft cap formula is (**raw MS x 0,8 + 83**)

2nd soft cap: when MS is 490 <, the soft cap formula is (**raw MS x 0,5 + 230**)

Math formulas:

**(MS)**: base MS x (1 + phase rush bonus + (phase rush bonus x DH stacks x 0,05))

**(Slow resist)**: 1 - (slow percentage - (slow percentage x (0,75 + 0,75 x DH stacks x 0,05))

**(Full formula)**: (base MS x (1 + phase rush bonus + (phase rush bonus x DH stacks x 0,05)) x (1 - (slow percentage - (slow percentage x (0,75 + 0,75 x 0,05 x DH stacks)) **and** x 0,8 + 85 if the MS is 415 ≤ but ≤ 490 **or** x 0,5 + 230 if the MS is 490 <

*When slow resist goes over 100%, slows start to give you more MS based on the slow percentage instead of slowing you.*

MS bonus chart: (rounded)[ https://gyazo.com/54f8738ea2a5019143b09e0260d4655e](https://gyazo.com/54f8738ea2a5019143b09e0260d4655e)

&#x200B;

Basic MS calculation example: Level 7, 355 base MS, 6 DH stacks

Raw MS: 355 x (1 + 0,30292 + (0,30292 x 0,05 x 6) = **494,79758** (because raw MS is over 490, we use 2nd soft cap) 494,79758 x 0,5 + 230 = 477,39... **\~ 477 (final MS)**

&#x200B;

Example with slow resists and 1st soft cap: Level 13, 335 base MS, 5 DH stacks, 15% slow

335 x (1 + 0,35584 + (0,35584 x 5 x 0,05)) x (1 - (0,15 - (0,15 x (0,75 + 0,75 x 5 x 0,05))) =

335 x (1 + 0,35584 + 0,08896)) x (1 - (0,15 - (0,15 x 0,9375))) =

335 x 1,4448) x (1 - (0,15 - 0,140625)) = 484,008 x (1 - 0,009375) =

484,008 x 0,990625 = **479,470425** **(raw MS)** *(484 ms before slows and slow resists)*

soft cap applied: 479,470425 x 0,80 + 83 = 466,57... **\~ 467 (final MS)**

&#x200B;

Example with slow resists and 2nd soft cap: Level 15, 370 base MS, 8 DH stacks, 30% slow

Raw MS: 370 x (1 + 0,37348 + (0,37348 x 0,05 x 8)) x (1 - (0,3 - (0,3 x (0,75 + 0,75 x 8 x 0,05)))) =

370 x (1 + 0,37348 + 0,149392) x (1 - (0,3 - (0,3 x 1,05))) =

370 x 1,522872 x (1 - (0,3 - 0,315)) = 563.46264 x (1 - (-0,015)) =

563.46264 x 1,015 = **571,9145796** **(raw MS)** *(563 ms before slows and slow resists)*

soft cap applied: 571,9145796 x 0,5 + 230 = 515,95... **\~ 516 (final MS)**

&#x200B;

**Lethal Tempo**

Base value: 35,882% + 4,118% x level (40% - 110%, Leaguepedia)

Math formula: (LT’s base AS + (LT’s base AS x 0,05 x DH stacks)

Chart: (rounded)[ https://gyazo.com/e05e5412e22dbdc8091f761a6bfc8074](https://gyazo.com/e05e5412e22dbdc8091f761a6bfc8074)

&#x200B;

**Hail of Blades**

Math formula: 110% x ( 1 + DH stacks x 0,05)

Basically you get extra 6,5% AS added to 110% for each DH stack, simple.

&#x200B;

**Glacial Augment**

Every DH stack increases base slow percentage by **2,5%**.

Slow soft cap: If rawMS is below 220, then slow soft cap is applied (rawMS x 0,5 + 110, League Wiki)

Base values:

**\[Melee\]** 44,412% + 0,588% x level (45 - 55%, League Wiki)

**\[Ranged\]** 29,412% + 0,588% x level (30 - 40%, League Wiki)

Slow from item actives is always 60%.

Slow is calculated **after** **raw MS** but **before applying any soft caps** *(if needed).*

Math formula: enemy rawMS x (1 - (base value + base value x 0,025 x DH stacks)) if MS drops below 220 then x 0,5 + 110

&#x200B;

Example: Level 14 Nunu (Melee), 5 DH stacks, target has 375 MS.

375 x (1 - (0,52644 + 0,52644 x 0,025 x 5)) = 375 x (1 - (0,52644 + 0,065805)) =

375 x (1 - 0,592245) = 375 x 0,407755 = **152,908125 (rawMS)** and because rawMS is below 220, we apply soft cap --> 152,908125 x 0,5 + 110 = 186,454… \~ **186 (final MS)**

&#x200B;

**Fleet Footwork**

Every DH stack increases healing by 5 and also the 1 second MS bonus by 5%.

Base MS bonus is always 20%

Math formula: 0,2 + (0,2 x 0,025 x DH stacks) and soft caps if needed

&#x200B;

Rest of the keystones didn’t have anything else other than flat damage added for each DH stack.

Like I mentioned before, I used so much time on double-checking the values and I’m sure that it is all at least 99,99% correct BUT in case there is something that could be improved in some way, for example simpler math solution / formula or even in the way I wrote or organized this post, hit me up and I’ll adjust / fix it."|Jebsuwu|False|https://redd.it/ejxz2d|16148|0.95|23|508|1|leagueoflegends

ekeoev|2020-01-05 15:53:16|Wouldn't it be great to be able to create different Emote Sets for different Champions?!|"**TL:DR** \- It would be great if we could arrange **different** ***emote sets*** **for different champions!** :)

There are many emotes that I would really like to use when I'm playing the champion that is on the emote.

For example I have four ""Thumbs Up"" emotes featuring Lux, Ziggs, Draven and Naut. Whenever I play Ziggs I would like to have his thumbs up emote. The same goes for other champs. And there are many more examples like this.

This would be exactly like Item Sets just instead of the items you would pick emotes. So whenever I play Ziggs I would have his thumbs up emote without having to change anything before I queue. Changing emotes before a game to fit a certain champion is not only annoying but very impractical too because most of the time I do not know which champ I'm going to play before champ select and even if I do they might get banned or picked by someone else.

This would, at least to some extent, help with the bad feeling that is caused by having so many great emotes but using only few.

EDIT: As I just learned you can change emotes in CS so that makes it less annoying. Anyhow it would still be much better to have emote sets 'cause browsing trough 100 emotes while you have to pick runes, summs and other stuff is still somewhat annoying."|Iron_Challenger|False|https://redd.it/ekeoev|65|0.82|0|11|1|leagueoflegends

ek9fau|2020-01-05 06:40:40|Aatrox's Animation Canceling: A New Fast Combo|"Hello there! For once, I'm not here to make a post talking about Aatrox's issues. I'm actually here to talk about something I found **that solves one of his issues**, his Black Cleaver stacking.

TL;DR: Aatrox has animation cancels, the timing is extremely strict, combo is towards the bottom of the post. Click the links to watch each component.

Aatrox is a slow Black Cleaver stacker, due to the nature of each of his abilities:

* Each Q has a 0.6s cast time. 

* W has an average travel time of 0.5s, with 1.5s before it pulls. This pull is avoidable.

* His autos have a slow windup, and his passive takes about 0.5s to fully complete. 

As a result, this is currently [Aatrox's fastest combo](https://youtu.be/_p2nKr2D_tE): Q1, W, EQ2, Passive, W Pull into Q3. You can slot an additional auto afterwards for extra damage, but this combo is pretty much his bread and butter all-in combo.

This means that Aatrox's combo takes 4.3s to fully stack Black Cleaver optimally. If they dodge or you miss, it can take even longer, which chalks him up as one of the worst Black Cleaver users (despite his core reliance on the item), due to most other Cleaver users (such as Darius and Garen, despite both opting for Trinity Force nowadays) being able to stack it much faster.



---
For those of you who don't know, Aatrox can animation cancel an auto attack by casting his Q at any attack speed. At 1.0 attack speed or greater, he can additionally animation cancel into W, and out of W.

If you've seen [Exil's video on Aatrox's animation cancels](https://youtu.be/4xRcgGfp06o), you'll notice he purchases a lot of attack speed as a way to test Aatrox animation canceling. 

We traditionally do not purchase attack speed items on Aatrox, since they tend to inefficiently slot themselves (barring AS Aatrox builds) with Aatrox's Q, and its long cast time. At attack speeds of 1.5 or greater, you actually **lose DPS** by casting Q, and would be better off simply autoing your target. However, some attack speed **is good on Aatrox**, with Legend: Alacrity and the Attack Speed shard being common choices on Aatrox, according [to Lolalytics.](https://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/platinum/plus/champion/Aatrox/)

However, with Berserker Greaves, you will have enough Attack Speed to do a full combo that stacks Black Cleaver **before Q3 lands**, while maximizing DPS! This combo **can be done without attack speed**, but takes slightly longer (for obvious reasons, lower AS, slower auto animation).

Here's the breakdown on his animation cancels:

* Each animation canceled auto into Q takes 0.7s, and grants 4 stacks of Conqueror and 2 Black Cleaver stacks. 

This means that 3 auto canceled Qs will stack Black Cleaver in 2.1s. (This requires you to be in range, and you sacrifice sweetspot damage).

* Animation canceled [auto, W, auto, into Q3 ](https://youtu.be/8BiZ83ulkbY)takes 0.9s, 0.8s if you're point-blank. 

Done properly, it will apply 4 stacks of Black Cleaver, and 8 stacks of Conqueror.

This means that with a proper fast combo, Aatrox can potentially stack Black Cleaver in 2.3s, making him **one of the fastest Black Cleaver stackers in the game**. Mind you, this is only potentially. The speed at which you stack it is entirely dependent on you and your opponent.



---
From here, animation canceling will be denoted by a lowercase ""a"" preceding whatever is being animation canceled. (For example, passive is normal, aPassive means it has been animation canceled into the next part of the combo.)

His [full fast combo,](https://youtu.be/pj9VUQUnCSU) (which I'm gonna call The Mutilator) with animation canceling is:

* aPassive, EQ1 (E backwards, Q forward), Q2, aAuto, aW, aAuto (or aPassive), Q3, Passive (or Auto), E, Auto.

If done properly, you land all 3 sweetspots, and stack Conqueror by aW, and Black Cleaver by the aAuto, before Q3 lands. You can squeeze in an additional auto, but you sacrifice the sweetspot for Q2 in exchange, yielding this combo: 

* aPassive, EQ1 (E backwards, Q forward), aAuto, Q2, aAuto, aW, aAuto (or aPassive), Q3, Passive (or Auto), E, Auto (or Passive).

[Here's another version of the combo.](https://youtu.be/6WR4Z7Th4VQ) Here's that same combo [slowed down.](https://youtu.be/5MvqDzM-Qp8)

If you build Tiamat (some of you do), you'll be able to stack Cleaver by doing aTiamat into Q2, and Conqueror by aAuto (or aW if Tiamat gives Conqueror stacks, idk).



---
This is Aatrox's hardest and highest damage combo, and as such, I've yet to consistently do it against practice tool dummies, and very rarely against champions due to the sheer difficulty of the timing. Better Aatrox players will be able to consistently pull this off, further extending Aatrox's mastery and skill level. As you gain attack speed (Omnistone giving HoB for example), you can squeeze in two autos between a Q or W, increasing DPS.

* Additionally, this is Aatrox's highest burst healing combo, as you artificially boost your attack speed by animation canceling your autos.

Thanks for reading, I hope this gives you the Edge (...of the Darkin Blade) you need to triumph over your foes, and hear the lamentations of their women! Thanks for reading! Let's talk about it.

Edit: Thanks to u/Angry_train pointing out a missed Optimization with EWQ, I now have developed [an even higher damage combo.](https://youtu.be/f9c2iS8PwIQ) It additionally uses Tiamat to demonstrate Tiamat's usability.

ekx8jp|2020-01-06 17:30:20|[Traducción al español] Entrevista de Ashley Kang (Korizon Esports) a Mystic, ADC de Afreeca Freecs|"&#x200B;

**-Hola.**

**Mystic:** Hola.

**-Acabas de llegar a las finales de la KeSPA Cup al haber barrido a DragonX 3-0. ¿Cómo te sientes ahora mismo?**

**Mystic:** DragonX sólo ha tenido un corto periodo de tiempo para trabajar la sinergia. Además, tienen a un par de jugadores novatos, así que no creímos que perderíamos contra ellos. Sin embargo, parece que nos ha resultado más fácil de lo esperado, por lo que estoy feliz.

**-¿Qué ha ido mejor de lo esperado? Basado en el rendimiento.**

**Mystic:** Creo que hemos jugado mejor como equipo, en comparación al rival.

**-Has mencionado que DragonX no ha tenido mucho tiempo para trabajar en su sinergia. Sin embargo, Afreeca Freecs se completó hace poco. Habéis ido mejorando conforme progresabais en la KeSPA Cup. ¿Cómo ha desarrollado tan rápido su trabajo en equipo Afreeca?**

**Mystic:** Es verdad que no llevamos mucho tiempo juntos, pero el entrenador iloveoov ha hecho un gran trabajo conectándonos. Por eso creo hemos encajado tan rápido los unos con los otros.

**-¿Puedo preguntar cómo os está conectando iloveoov?**

**Mystic:** Incluso fuera del juego, nos hace sentir como si todos fuéramos amigos, nos deja construir una buena relación. Siempre insiste en lo importante que son estos factores. Además, la forma en la que practicamos lo refleja.

**-¿Puedo preguntar si te has hecho amigo cercano de algún jugador en particular?**

**Mystic:** Hmmm… Creo que me llevo bien con todos. Sin embargo, termino pasando mucho tiempo comunicándome con los jugadores de apoyo. Por ello, me lo paso bien con ellos.

**-Recientemente, decidiste volver a la LCK y has empezado jugar para Afreeca Freecs. Habías jugado cuatro años en Team WE. Tienes un récord impresionante como tirador, así que estoy segura de que recibirías muchas ofertas, pero has terminado en Afreeca Freecs. ¿Puedo preguntarte qué factores te llevaron a tomar esta decisión?**

**Mystic:** Bueno… Tengo un hijo, tengo una esposa. Lo pasaron mal porque pasaba todo mi tiempo en el extranjero. Me iba a retirar, iba a conseguir un trabajo normal, iba a cuidar de mi hijo. Mi mujer también quería eso. Entonces, lo pensé un poco, y todavía soy bueno al juego. Bueno, tiendo a ser bueno, y todavía no he alcanzado mi objetivo. Hablé con mi mujer y conseguí su permiso para seguir siendo jugador profesional más tiempo.

**-Y tu mujer también apoya esa decisión.**

**Mystic:** Sí, exactamente. Si hubiese jugado para un equipo extranjero, no habría sido fácil verles a menudo y me habría sentido mal por ellos. Si juego en Corea, al menos puedo verles más a menudo. Por ello, decidí mudarme a Corea y unirme a un equipo coreano.

**-Has jugado en un solo equipo, en una sola región, durante mucho tiempo. Cuando llegaste a Corea y a Afreeca Freecs, ¿te sorprendió algo? ¿Tuviste que adaptarte a algo?**

**Mystic:** Hay muchas cosas, muchas. Estuve en Team WE durante mucho tiempo, así que, la forma en la que jugábamos, la forma en la que veíamos el juego… No se desviaba mucho y tenía el mismo patrón. Pasé así cuatro años. Entonces, de repente, he empezado a jugar para otro equipo, nuevos compañeros, nuevo cuerpo técnico. Todo está patas arriba y todavía estoy adaptándome.

**-Quizá esta sea una pregunta muy directa. Dicen que la LPL es una región fértil de buenos tiradores y, ahora que has vuelto a corea, ¿qué piensas de esto? ¿Quién tiene mejores tiradores, la LCK o la LPL?**

**Mystic:** Lo primero de todo… Tienen diferentes estilos en la fase de líneas. Al menos, esa es mi opinión. En China… Cuando estaba en China, siempre nos traíamos al jungla y siempre peleábamos, y conseguíamos la ventaja en la fase de líneas en la mayor parte de las situaciones. Sin embargo, hoy en día… El carril superior y el central de mi equipo también son fuertes. Ahora, juego de forma segura dependiendo de la situación del jungla. Si el enfrentamiento es malo, no tomo CS e intento sobrevivir los diveos de torre. Juego de forma “más segura” aquí. Considero que todos son buenos jugadores, tanto en China como en Corea. Pero, en la superficie… Como nuestros estilos son tan diferentes, la gente termina diciendo que los tiradores chinos son mejores.

**-Ya has sido compañero de Spirit. Fue en Team WE, ¿verdad?**

**Mystic:** Cuando llegué a China por primera vez, Spirit estaba jugando para ese equipo.

**-Quizá sea por ello, pero mucha gente está describiendo al Afreeca Freecs actual como el Team WE versión 2. ¿Estás de acuerdo con este consenso público? Si es así, ¿cómo crees que se ha creado?**

**Mystic:** Bueno, cuando jugué con Spirit, fue como… Honestamente, mis recuerdos están algo borrosos. En aquel entonces… Hmmm… Realmente, no estoy seguro, pero siento que somos muy diferentes ahora. Ahora, nuestro top, medio y jungla son muy sólidos. Nos turnamos quién se lleva los recursos y cada línea tiene el potencial de carrilear un partido. Nos sacrificamos por los otros y trabajamos por cada uno, pero no sé cómo era entonces.

**-Bueno, son cosas que pueden pasas. Mi memoria también está borrosa. Sin embargo, el hecho de que hayáis progresado en la KeSPA Cup debe de ser significativo. Cuando Afreeca Freecs jugó su primer partido de la KeSPA Cup, el equipo todavía parecía inestable. Sin embargo, el trabajo en equipo ha encajado rápidamente y el rendimiento individual también ha mejorado. ¿Cómo de orgulloso o feliz estás con el nivel actual de Afreeca Freecs?**

**Mystic:** Cada vez que les veo trabajar juntos, a veces sacrifican cosas los unos para los otros. Supongo que estoy feliz. Todos queremos ganar. Nos cuidamos entre todos. Supongo que es algo bueno.  

**-Pero puede que no sea tan fácil como suena.** **Si fuera tan fácil, los equipos no tendrían problemas encajando nuevas alineaciones y llegando a las finales de la KeSPA Cup.**

**Mystic:** Supongo que ha sido así porque confiamos los unos en los otros.

**-Vuestro próximo rival será SANDBOX Gaming. SANDBOX ha mostrado sus puntos fuertes al ganar a T1 y llegando a las finales. ¿Tienes alguna resolución para ese partido?**

**Mystic:** SANDBOX… Tampoco han tenido grandes cambios en la alineación, ¿verdad? Han tenido mucho tiempo para desarrollar su trabajo en equipo.

Yuumi shouldn't be able to stay permanently attached. Make her W have a time limit that forces Yuumi to detach once in a while. This will make her niche a lot less frustrating as she won't be permanently invulnerable..

ekx4n9|2020-01-06 17:22:11|A full spectrum Aphelios soft-rework/nerf concept|"Disclaimer: everything following is purely the opinion of an armchair designer, part fanwank part appeal to riot's balance team, in no way do I gaurantee the following rework would balance Aphelios but I do believe it has good ideas that the real live balance team could consider. Experimental ideas will be marked with *italics* ideas that I think ABSOLUTELY SHOULD GO LIVE will be **bolded**. This will also probably be a pretty long post as I am extremely enthusiastic about this champion on every level and want to see him fulfill the fantasy of being 'gunvoker' as much as possible in league. There will not be a TLDR as this champion cannot be summed up easily.

# High level concepts  
Aphelios in his live state is one of the most broken ADCs to ever launch, he makes 25-range-buff Kai'sa look modest and competes with release Kalista for absolutely OPness, and he does it all without having a single dash or stealth in his kit. Obviously he does this in many many ways, everyone has seen infernum R teamwipes and ridiculous plays with calibrum marks killing a target at 2k range, along with one shot kills using severum q and solo-killing assassins with crescendum in under half a second. I aim to address each and every one of these discrepancies using balance changes to numbers and mechanics, while preserving the spirit of each weapon as much as possible, and without adding true inherent trade offs.

Many people proposed giving each weapon some sort of downside, lower attack speed, damage, or range for some of them, but in my opinion making these changes are very feel-bad for the Aphelios player without really making him easier to play against, so I approached balancing his arsenal from a different perspective, 4 out of the 5 weapons have a particular affinity for one type of build, Crit or On-Hit, with minimal synergy given to the opposite type, Gravitum sits in the middle as an omnipresent utility option. The goal is not to force Phel into building only one or the other, and making the other 2 weapons useless in that build, but really encourage modulating the arsenal to have the weapon you built for available at the right times, and merely ""making do"" with the other ones. Every weapon is usable in every build, but there are now meaningful choices in weapon selection and many suboptimal combos. Aphelios will require strong build knowledge, weapon knowledge, and some degree of trickery to succeed. In addition, Aphelios will be changed into more of a late game champion, a high skill alternative to the other immobile hypercarries, Kog and Jinx.

# Global changes  
- **Both currently equipped weapons appear on Aphelios' health bar, as well as a short description in his buff bar. Enemies and allies can click on him to get a better understanding of his current weapon pair.**
- *Aphelios level up passive is completely retooled, he no longer gains AS or AD per level at all, but can invest into these stats with each level up he gets, up to 18 times each. The armor penetration is completely removed. At level 18 with 18 points invested into a single stat, he would have either 120 base AD or 1.1 total attack speed.*
- R no longer deals basic attack damage, instead it is a simple AOE exploding skillshot that applies Aphelios' current weapon effect, turning it into a teamfight utility rather than a burst tool. Some weapons have individual R changes listed in their sections.

# Calibrum  
Identity: calibrum should be a long range sniping tool, a semi-Caitlyn in one gun with a dash of Jhin. Calibrum is a critical strike weapon designed for long range utility, finishing off stragglers, staying safe in teamfights, and dealing burst damage with it's marks.

Changes  
- Calibrum mark attacks are 50% slower than Aphelios current attack speed, locking Aphelios into the full animation time and leaving him vulnerable  
- **they are no longer globally ranged but only reach to 3 times Calibrum's auto range (1950),** in exchange they are now always hitscan.  
- *Calibrum attacks no longer have a base damage, but deal 120% of Aphelios' AD and can critically strike for 240% AD or 300% with IE.*  
- marks applied by R can be popped one at a time, instead of only on a single target. 

# Severum  
Identity: Severum is a dueling weapon and On-hit mechanism, it gains no benefit from crit other than the normal damage boost. It's designed for healing, 1v1s, and some degree of burst damage. 

Changes   
- **Severum now heals a flat amount on hit instead of granting bonus lifesteal,** from 3-21 scaling with levels.   
- **Severum Q does not critically strike anymore**, but it's attack speed scaling is increased slightly.

# Gravitum
Identity: As Aphelios' one utility option, Gravitum should be equally viable for either crit or on-hit builds, it's early game power is heavily reduced but it becomes potent later in the game for damage regardless of build.

Changes:
- **Gravitum slow is significantly reduced early game, scaling from 15% to it's live value as Aphelios levels up**  
- Gravitum deals 10% of Aphelios total Ad as bonus magic damage on hit  
- Gravitum Q has it's damage removed entirely  
- Gravitum ult also has this 10% bonus damage applied to it's damage

# Infernum  
Identity: Infernum is a teamfight monster that scales with crit, similar to jinx rockets. Unlike jinx rockets they can be absorbed by front line champions, and it's potential for waveclear is heavily reduced. The teamfight burst on R is heavily toned down into a strong nuke against clustered enemies but not a game winner

Changes  
- *Infernum basic attacks can now be blocked, colliding with the first target they hit and splashing behind it.*  
- **Infernum R deals 30% less damage for each additional target splashed, down to 10%**

# Crescendum  
Identity: One of Aphelios' current strongest options, crescendum  should be heavily tuned down in it's ability to melt single targets while retaining it's potential for both burst and dueling, it overlaps with severum in many ways as it's brother on-hit weapon, but differentiated by it's unique scalings and turret placement.

Changes  
- *Crescendum mini-chakrams are now expended all at once on the first basic attack against a champion or tower, dealing true damage equal to 10% of the initial auto attack hit.* (many quirks exist here, for example with 10 mini chakrams and a sheen auto you will essentially do double sheen damage, the damage is only true damage to prevent armor double-dipping reduction, not real true damage)  
- **Critical strikes no longer increase crescendum's flight speed**

# Conclusion

Aphelios is in my opinion one of League's coolest champions ever, but his release state is an abomination of overtuned numbers that nearly any player with the basics of ADC play can stomp on, my changes here, though in some ways experimental and verging on hard rework territory, are intended to make him a champ that can only succeed with some extreme knowledge of his kit and it's interactions, I intended to raise his skill floor for success in many ways, and I hope you enjoyed reading my vision for the Weapon of the Faithful."|Draconilian|False|https://redd.it/ekx4n9|0|0.36|0|5|1|leagueoflegends

 I found a trick that helps! if you open task manager and force close the ""League of Legends (X)"" x, of course, being a random number but usually 1-5 it restarts client quickly and it runs near perfectly - till it has to be done again. 

Either that or use the ""close client in game"" option in your settings, that being checked restarts your client after every game, being the slower, but more user friendly option!

ejyhxn|2020-01-04 16:14:21|Riot Cactopus on the Strategies They Used to Announce Controversial or Risky Video Games|"/u/the_cactopus [tweeted](https://twitter.com/RKRigney/status/1213488917053181952) this thread on how Riot handled messaging behind all the announcements during L10's stream:
>5 WAYS TO ANNOUNCE RISKY/CONTROVERSIAL VIDEO GAMES

>Early last year, there was some fear/concern at Riot about our plans to announce a number of mobile games and a card game.

>All the announcements ended up going really well. 

>ITT I'm gonna share some strategies we used. >🧵1/22

>STRAT 1: OWN YOUR BULLSHIT

>So the first game we announced was Teamfight Tactics AKA 
@TFT. At the time, there was only one other game in the genre: the OG Dota Auto Chess mod. Frankly, we didn't want the reaction to our announcement to be ""lol nice DAC clone.""

>The solution here was to be honest and talk about TFT with players the same way we were talking about it internally.

>Instead of trying to dance around DAC, @Riot_Beernana called it out by name in our announcement. 

>Players liked that we didn't try to bullshit anybody about it.

>Tangent: It was important to introduce a name for the genre. The existence of the concept ""autobattler"" gave us and others permission to play in the space.

>I believe using ""autobattler"" in our post and our press releases led directly to the term's widespread adoption. Example:
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENcuJX5U4AA_qgb?format=png&name=small

>Okay, so STRAT 2: LEAN INTO THE MEMES

>Sometimes, you just need players to know that you ""get it."" Playing with a spicy meme is one powerful way to do that.

>TFT Mobile was the first mobile game announced by Riot, and we were nervous about it. Mostly because of memes.

>If you don't already know, a couple of years back, Blizzard suffered a lot of backlash (unjustly imo) to their announcement of Diablo: Immortal, a mobile game. One line from a dev bewildered by the response (""Don't you guys have phones?"") became a massive meme in gaming circles. Over time, posting ""dONt U gUyS hAVe phONeS?"" became a way for gamers to signal displeasure with ANY studio making a mobile game. It's a way for players to mock and punish devs who try to expand to new audiences beyond their core audience of PC players. Devs hate this meme. I agree with @draggles's theory that this meme was a product of a particular moment of heightened anti-mobile-gaming sentiment, which is now starting to recede as more good AAA mobile games come out. 

>So for our TFT mobile announce, I wanted us to PLAY WITH AND SUBVERT the meme.

>This idea was not super popular internally at Riot. Everybody felt sorry for the innocent Blizzard dev who'd gotten caught in the crossfire, and nobody wanted to attract any of that heat to themselves. 

>Nonetheless, we decided to announce TFT Mobile this way:

>The line was a hit, we avoided backlash, and players are hyped for TFT mobile. The takeaway here is: It's hard to weaponize something against someone when they've just taken the weapon and done a funny dance with it. 

>Subverting a meme in this way strips it of its power.

>One downside: Dancing with a meme that caused pain to other people—in this case, people at Blizzard in paritcular—caused some to interpret our subversiveness as us taking a shot at Blizzard, which wasn't our intention. (Would love my Blizz friends' perspectives on this, btw.)

>Anyway.. STRAT 3: SHOW THE LOVE IN THE PRODUCT

>TFT Mobile wasn't the only mobile game we announced. The bigger news was @Wildrift, aka ""proper"" League of Legends on mobile. That team did many things right w/ this announce, but I wanna point out one particularly powerful segment.

>Wild Rift's collection system has tons of fun animations for champs and skins. There's no functional reason for them to be there—the animators just wanted to make something cool for players. 

>Devs poured real love into these animations, so we decided to show off a montage of em:

>The basis of SHOW THE LOVE IN THE PRODUCT is: People are more likely to respect the thing you're making when it's clear YOU respect it. When you made something look good just for the sake of it looking good, there's integrity and honor in that. People dig that stuff. So show it.

>STRAT 4: SURPRISE AND DELIGHT YOUR CORE AUDIENCE

>The fourth and final ""risky"" game we announced in 2019 was 
@PlayRuneterra. A card game, in 2019. Like our mobile games guys, this team felt sort of terrorized by anti-card-game sentiment and memes online. You know the ones.

>The way we introduced the first footage of 
@PlayRuneterra was wild. Instead of dropping it on its own, the first glance came at what players THOUGHT was the end of the ""League 10 Year"" celebration. The clip was like only a few seconds long and also revealed THREE OTHER new games:

>A longer, standalone trailer would've made players say ""What is it? What is–?! Oh. A card game...""

>Instead, we got reactions like this: [insert gif of Tyler1 reacting to L10]

>Not all of these games are exciting for every League player. But almost everyone will be excited by AT LEAST ONE of those games. By showing all four at once, the takeaway was ""Riot is making something for me.""

>Your core audience NEEDS to know you're gonna take care of them. So when you make something that'll appeal to only one segment, consider bundling it with something that'll delight the rest. That's why we did all of these game announces alongside the League 10 year celebration.

>STRAT 5: SIGNAL TRIBAL MEMBERSHIP

>After hitting players with the ""surprise and delight"" reveal, the 
@PlayRuneterra team sealed the deal with a video message that nailed all four of the strategies above, along with one other big one.

>Here's the key part imo: Everything here screams ""I am one of you."" The childhood photos are instantly humanizing, and 
@RiotUmbrage's list of the genres problems grabs your attention if you're a CCG player. It proves he's worth listening to, unblocking him to deliver a successful pitch for his game.

>Okay, that's the thread! 🧵

>I'll close out by pointing at an example of another game studio totally nailing a pitch for a game that could've been controversial. 

>The @pathofexile team REALLY knows how to talk to their audience and it shows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_YjBTYHhug"|Spideraxe30|False|https://redd.it/ejyhxn|2076|0.97|0|345|1|leagueoflegends

Which path should I take?

Only take a beating and let them run amok?

Nah, that isn't how I do things

I will fight my way to the top  


My fists beg for brutality

Each punch makes me closer to being known

I will make them fear me

I will take it all for my own  


My goal is clear

It has all been set

I will rule it all

For I am The Boss, Sett

ek3pwt|2020-01-04 22:37:12|Assorted trivia about several champions' developments you might not have heard of!|"I am fascinated by champion design and am excited to learn about what champions *didn't* become as much as what they *did*, not because I believe that their initial designs were better, but there's just so much damn creativity and awesome ideas that I believe should've been allowed to exist to some degree in a better world.

I don't have trivia on every single champion because Riot doesn't publicly disclose every idea they tried out (they ""icebox""/""put on hold"" rather than outright cancel, as some ideas may be revisited in the future, so they like to keep their better ideas under wraps), but here's a list of some of my favorite ideas from the champions Riot *has* spoken up about.

(note: these might be common knowledge to some, but I felt like making this post on the offchance you don't because chances are that nobody's aware of *all* of these. If you do, congrats!)

**AATROX**: For his 2018 VGU,[ a few abilities were tested](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8una0m/were_the_team_that_updated_aatrox_ask_us_anything/e1gmhiv/):

* One version of his ultimate would have created a ""war zone"" that would reduce the death timers of both allies and enemies who died in it. It was a crazy ""fiesta zone"", but it caused too many balance problems.
* He had another ability to offer the chance for allies to become Darkin -- [Aatrox would drop his sword for someone to pick up, and they'd pay a ""Blood Price"" for it for bonus stats and a revive with Aatrox's R.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPSi2AS9dNk&feature=youtu.be)

**AHRI**: From [Riot's ORIGINS post](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/09/origins-ahri/):

* An early version of Ahri had no fox ears and her nine tails were really just suggestions from the shape of her dress. They thought it was too lame, and so they focused on making her a proper foxgirl instead of an ""artificially unique one"".
* An early version of her ultimate had her dash infinitely over time, basically turning herself into an Ezreal ult. Senior game designer Colt ""Ezreal"" Hallam claimed ""We had to change this ultimate due to its interactions with the Dominion map, which is easily one of my biggest regrets on the character.""

**AKALI**: For her 2018 VGU, [they considered letting her ""ride"" projectiles from other champions \(say, a Jinx rocket\)](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/941a2d/were_some_of_the_rioters_that_updated_akali_ask/e3hi99k/), but it was too impractical and annoying to work with. They also made it so her smoke bomb created a dragon-shaped billow in the center ([which was shown in her rework's teaser image](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/8/89/Akali_Update_Teaser_01.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180201004842)), but it was cut for clarity.

**APHELIOS**:  From [Riot's Champ Insights post](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/11/champion-insights-aphelios/):

* They originally wanted to make him a mage, specifically ""a classic wizard archetype"" with many potential combo-attacks (Invoker, anyone?), but in practice he was functionally identical to other mages in playstyle.
* They came up with the ""gunswap marksman"" idea first, champion identity second, [and explored a bunch](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/05_adc_01_k1ux2jgssqrd1kzpvave.jpg). My personal favorite is ""Braum’s mean older brother, who carried a totem pole that channeled Freljordian animal spirits to swap abilities,"" [who was specifically cut because his design implied he was tanky.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/e1hw5i/champion_insights_aphelios/f8q6bm1/)

* CertainlyT originally suggested [Aphelios carry as much as 25 guns](https://twitter.com/MarkYetter/status/1199018998525882368), and also [suggested that his power be based off the stage of the *real life moon.*](https://twitter.com/JustNovalas/status/1199043169964314627) Ngl, I hope he wasn't joking, godspeed

**AURELION SOL**: As some of you might know, ASol was originally planned to be a different champ: a long, serpentine storm dragon named Ao Shin. He was reworked because Riot had a lot of trouble with the technical aspects of the idea -- He was apparently ""10-12 Teemos in length"" and they wanted him to be able to wrap his body around enemies, but this made it hard for him to hide in bushes, and it consumed a ton of his power budget (he needed to be fast enough to move around enemies and tanky enough to survive them fighting back).

**AZIR**: [Lotttttt of stuff from his ORIGINS post, too much to include here](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/06/origins-azir/). the tl;dr version was that he was envisioned as a sand mage named Seth since 2013-14, and was reworked countless times due to technical and creative issues.

**BARD**: [Originally for his passive,](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/58brfg/dev_on_champion_prototypes/d8zag2d/) Riot gave him the ability to go through several different color versions of Meeps that would boost his abilities, [and they would all continuously follow behind him like Pikmin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtCQ1oW4HCE&feature=emb_title) Testing made them prefer simpler upgrades to basic attacks over his abilities, resulting in his passive's current state.

**DIANA**: Yknow how that recent rework where they made her Moonfall (circle-surrounding ability) her ultimate? [It turns out this was (kind of) the original plan when she was first made](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1xicc6/so_ive_been_reading_quite_a_bit_of_diana/cfbvo7u/): it was a channeled AoE that dealt true damage based off a resource called ""Scorn"", but was replaced for being ""toxic and nearly impossible to counter.""

**EKKO**: [They wanted to make his ultimate be able to properly rewind enemies along with him](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/xEVZQjPL-champion-qa-ekko-the-boy-who-shattered-time?show=flat&comment=00c600000001), but no matter what they tried, it was considered too busted and confusing. [Also, they were developing Bard alongside him, and during a phase in playtesting, Bard had an ultimate where he would globally silence enemies, making games with both of them being globally annoyed no matter what.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5tuo7s/internal_play_testers_whats_the_funniest/ddpfsp2/?st=iz4qyohd&sh=3b3d20d8)

**EVELYNN**: From her [Champ Insights revolving her 2017 VGU](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/10/champ-insights-evelynn/), Riot originally wanted to make her scarier and demonic, with ""spider legs, cracked porcelain skin with shadows pushing their way out, the cavity of a missing eye you could peer into and see three eyes within."" They thought it was too much.

**GALIO**: [One idea for a passive in his 2017 VGU](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5zsulk/ama_were_the_team_behind_the_galio_update_ask_us/df0reyp/) was the ability to roost on top of turrets (or the remains of one), allowing him to cast spells at an increased range. When he jumped off, he could also chain it into his ultimate.

**GANGPLANK**: [One tested idea for his 2015 VGU was an ultimate nicknamed ""Pirate Gundam""](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/VyuLdWhd-intro-james-statikk-bach-champion-update-design-lead?comment=001f000000010000), summoning a giant, tanky unit that would either fire cannonballs or do a nerfed version of Malphite's ult. It didn't work out since it felt too powerful and required a ton of additional focus in visuals to implement it in game.

**GNAR**: [Originally, Mega Gnar's ult had him swallow a unit whole, and was directly said to have inspired Tahm Kench's entire ""devour"" mechanic.](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2016/10/dev-on-champion-prototypes/) This is a case of a good idea being reused for later -- the ability tested well, but they preferred it be the core mechanic to a new champion than tacked onto someone as uncontrollable as Gnar.

**JHIN**: [From his Champ Insights](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-preview/champion-insights-jhin), Jhin was originally envisioned as a ""mysterious robot cowboy bounty hunting sniper"" codenamed Deadeye. His design was fragmented, but while Jhin became a new psycho artist gunman, the design inspired his High Noon skin.

**JINX**: [From her ORIGINS post](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/04/origins-jinx/):

* Originally they wanted her to be ""a weapon-swapping ADC, like a ranged Udyr"" (or a primordial Aphelios, lol) where her abilities just switched to a different gun for her basic attacks. Riot found this pattern pretty boring after a while, so all she has left of the gunswap is her Q.
* They tested out a bunch of different ultimates. My favorite is ""Circle of Cats"", fired a bomb across the map that surrounded the first enemy hit with magic smoke, causing enemies who crossed it to turn into harmless kittens, but it's just not as direct as making them explode outright.

**KAI'SA**: [She was always meant to be a marksman, but went through different ideas in ideation.](https://www.deviantart.com/the-bravo-ray/art/Adc-Lady-731934072) Concepts included an ex-Purifier (Lucian's faction), a Vampire hunter that became a vampire, a [Zaunite life-essence-drainer](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/03/champ-insights-kaisa/), and even [an idea that she was part of a new breed of void monster trying to imitate humans.](https://twitter.com/LaurieGoulding/status/1038498320400805889)

**KAYN**: [Originally they wanted Kayn to be Xayah and Rakan's nemesis \(and was codenamed during development as ""Nemesis""\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6n39xh/waddup_were_the_rioters_that_did_kayn_ask_us/dk6fa2j/), but they decided to cut this because his relationship with Zed and conflict with Rhaast was more interesting.

**MISS FORTUNE**: [Riot toyed with giving her a new voiceover around 2018 \(around the same time they recorded the voiceover for her Gun Goddess skin\)](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/irL2yrul-quick-gameplay-thoughts-october-12), but it was scrapped after they tested some lines out and internal feedback was mixed; nobody could really agree on what they were looking for from her characterization, and they concluded that changing it was a worse decision than leaving it be.

**MORDEKAISER**: Lots of really cool ideas were thrown around for his 2019 VGU:

* [They toyed with giving Mordekaiser more interactions in dialogue](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/c0mubz/were_the_rioters_that_reworked_mordekaiser_ask_us/er5vri6/), but most were cut because they didn't want to make him ""chatty or conversational"". One cut line was a first encounter line for Kled where he asks [""What is... a taco?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/c0mubz/were_the_rioters_that_reworked_mordekaiser_ask_us/er60iur/)
* [One early idea was that his armor was meant to be based off the Immortal Bastion \(formerly his giant fortress in Noxus\), and so he looked architectural.](https://twitter.com/Spideraxe30/status/1137840423123111937)
* [Sooooo many scrapped abilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/c0mubz/were_the_rioters_that_reworked_mordekaiser_ask_us/er600uy/), including ones that interacted with the Death Realm. Favorites include a passive that automatically enslaved the souls of enemies he killed, and a circular missile that sent enemies it passed over into the Death Realm.

**MORGANA**: [For her dual VGU with Kayle, they tested some new abilities on her just to see if there was anything worth changing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ayfxhw/were_the_rioters_that_reworked_kayle_and_morgana/ei0qo4b/?context=3) One significant ability was making her ult have tiers like with Kayle, with each rank giving her new stats, but the only one that stuck was giving her bonus movement speed.

**NUNU and WILLUMP**:

* [One early story pitch for their 2018 VGU](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/jsdqvwff-ask-me-anything-about-narrative-for-warwick-urgot-swain-nunu-willump-and-pantheon-vgus?comment=00030000) was that they were part of a traveling circus who secretly stole artifacts from Lissandra. The Frostguard found out and slaughtered their tribe, but Nunu managed to steal a true ice artifact that gave them snowball-making powers.

* [One of their tested abilities was having Nunu toss out a climbing rope to lasso an enemy, which prevented them from moving beyond the two's radius](https://twitter.com/Xenogenic/status/1184214864635387905). It sounds like it had potential, but only that.

**ORNN**: 

* [From his development post](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/01/forging-ornn/), Ornn was in the works since around 2013, so he went through a lot of different design ideas (too many to list here), some of which influenced other champions like the 2014 VGU of Sion.

* [One version of his ultimate was ""Murderhenge""](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6vsg2f/ornn_is_a_champion_we_made_him_ask_us_anything/dm2oamx/?st=j6ry7j3e&sh=f2cc2c1b), where he summoned a giant volcano that erupted boulders across the area, and if Ornn charged into one of the boulders, they'd explode and damage enemies. It was ""Fun as hell but way too random and noisy.""

* [An idea for his passive that he could forge his own weapons to affect his basic attacks for a while](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6vsg2f/ornn_is_a_champion_we_made_him_ask_us_anything/dm2obe9/?st=j6ry7nok&sh=a9b2e53d), like an extra hammer for AoE, a blade for piercing damage, and an axe for CC.

**PYKE**:

* Pyke was planned to be an ""assassin support"" from day one, and [went through a bunch of ability experimentation](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8ojeqo/were_some_of_the_rioters_that_created_pyke_ask_us/e03stbr/?context=3). My favorite was a [""kidnap spell""](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8ojeqo/were_some_of_the_rioters_that_created_pyke_ask_us/e03u1el/?context=3) where he'd mark his current position, then could dash forward, and if he collided with a champion, he'd yank them both back to the starting point.

* [While coming up with identities for a ""dark assassin support""](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8ojeqo/were_some_of_the_rioters_that_created_pyke_ask_us/e03tfir/?context=3), one of the ideas was making him a Shuriman sand wraith (influencing his Sand Wraith skin), and **an undead yordle from the Shadow Isles** ~~(HEY RIOT, WHAT THE FUCK, I HOPE YOU REUSE THIS)~~

**QIYANA**:

* [Originally, Riot wanted Ixtal to be a faction from a completely new continent away from Runeterra](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/c6lxgd/after_stopping_the_reveal_pages_why_are_they/esqaakg/?context=3), and [Qiyana was supposed to be from a race of metal people \(or an ""alloy girl""\)](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/RYJw4r), but they simply didn't have the time or bandwidth to accomplish this.
* [She was supposed to be able to use fire in her kit](https://twitter.com/JustNovalas/status/1167596917959745537), but there isn't enough fire in any map to gain it from. Also, [her ult was supposed to explode the ENTIRE river.](https://twitter.com/JustNovalas/status/1167597851888640000)

**QUINN**: 

* She was originally envisioned [as a ""two-handed sword assassin""](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3481674&page=9#post38176380), [but then someone asked ""Why not ranged?""](https://twitter.com/Iron_Stylus/status/870423628797452288?s=20) and her design changed.

* [An early version of her passive](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5tuo7s/internal_play_testers_whats_the_funniest/ddpfsp2/?st=iz4qyohd&sh=3b3d20d8) had Valor find any enemy below 30% max HP and suppress them for ""some obscene amount of time"".

* [Her full title is *supposed* to be ""Quinn and Valor""](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18ys5s/quinn_and_valor_ama/c8jvue5/?context=10000), but due to client tech issues, she could only be referred to as simply ""Quinn"" once she left PBE. (given Nunu and Willump years later, this is probably no longer an issue. Any time, Riot!)

**RAKAN and XAYAH**: The two were conceived as a ""botlane duo"", so different ways they could do duo mechanics were tested:

* One idea was for them to be [""a Storm Shaman and a Storm Elemental""](https://www.reddit.com/r/xayahmains/comments/8v4wrn/im_endlesspillows_the_champion_designer_for/e1kpjgr/?context=3), [where one could summon a lightning cloud to shock enemies and another with a gust of wind to blow it into place.](https://www.reddit.com/r/xayahmains/comments/8v4wrn/im_endlesspillows_the_champion_designer_for/e1kn8om/?context=3) They also tested [giving them each a Vel'Koz beam that could combine into a single crazy ""megabeam"".](https://imgur.com/a/5vBDQD2)
* [Another idea was that the two would be vampires and would operate by a day/night cycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/xayahmains/comments/8v4wrn/im_endlesspillows_the_champion_designer_for/e1klh7l/?context=3) (hi, Dota 2) that made them more powerful at night, but it was considered ""one too many layers"" since they already had the duo mechanics.
* [The two originally had a mechanic where if one of them died](https://twitter.com/endlesspillows/status/1124532164698099712), they could still attach themselves to the other and continue fighting, which became the basis for Yuumi's kit.
* Xayah had a vast amount of work done on her for her kit -- [one of her ults eventually became Kai'Sa's](https://twitter.com/EndlessPillows/status/968338234131582977), [one ability was basically Ahri's W but with only one projectile](https://www.reddit.com/r/xayahmains/comments/8v4wrn/im_endlesspillows_the_champion_designer_for/e1kn8om/?context=3), [one passive granted her up to 10 stacks of bonus damage from using basic attacks \(which was ""1v9""-levels of busted\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xayahmains/comments/8v4wrn/im_endlesspillows_the_champion_designer_for/e1kl6yn/?context=3), and a mechanic kinda like Fiora's passive where she could target a side of a target for bonus damage, which got narrower but more powerful the more it was hit. 

**RAMMUS**: [The reason Rammus is so quiet is because when Riot \(very early on in the game's life, to remind you\) did try to give him a proper voiceover, but it sucked and they recorded a new one in 15 minutes. The rest is history!](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/2018/04/ask-riot-new-keystone-runes/)

**RIVEN**: [From her ORIGINS post](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/06/origins-riven/), Riven went through a lot of kit experimentation, especially with her ultimate. The descriptions of what they tried with her are much funnier than anything I can relay.

**RYZE**: Not exactly to do with the champion himself, but for his ""Call to Power"" short, there exists an unused model of [a Zaunite assassin](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/kY5LK) and [concept art of him with a little girl \(who I believe is Daisy from Annie's short?\)](https://www.deviantart.com/kse332/art/Ryze-756960889)

**SHACO**: [Sometime around 2017, they tested giving him a rework.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5tuo7s/internal_play_testers_whats_the_funniest/ddpfsp2/?st=iz4qyohd&sh=3b3d20d8) One of the tested abilities was an ultimate where he turned himself into a missle that fired in a direction. When he collided with Yasuo's Wind Wall, he never came back. ""The entire design team stood up and gave the Yasuo player a standing ovation.""

**SYLAS**: He was envisioned as a ""copycat"" champion since the beginning, but went through different ideas:

* [One idea was that he was this Houdini-esque magic escape artist who let Demacia capture him just to prove he could escape... but then ended up trapped for 20 years because of their petricite.](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ajr0kj/were_the_rioters_that_created_sylas_ask_us/eeyy6ep/?context=3) Smooth.

* [They originally tried making him more of a mage](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ajr0kj/were_the_rioters_that_created_sylas_ask_us/eez0j8z/?context=3) -- his original Q eventually became Neeko's Q, and he had a ""prison break"" move that let him cleanse CC, but it didn't work out. They changed him into a brawler because they found it was more versatile to use enemy ultimates around.

**TALIYAH**: [From her Champ Insights:](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-preview/champion-insights-taliyah-stoneweaver)

* Originally they wanted Taliyah's abilities to be much more destructive, with an ultimate that could outright remove any natural terrain. This was cut because nobody really knew how to make this look right, and the ability felt more a support champ than a self-reliant mage.

* One idea to go along with her ""weaver"" concept was to give her a ""spool"" that could gather up rocks that she could fire back onto her enemies. This implied that she had abilities that she could charge up, but she eventually ended up with none.

**URGOT**: A few, kind of wacky ideas were tested for his 2017 VGU:

* [Riot initially toyed with](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/08/champ-insights-urgot/) Urgot being a waaaaaay more theatrical, Batman-style villain (think Joker or Penguin) where he'd toy with his enemies with deranged playfulness before killing them. His taunt was *a full minute long*, and his ultimate had him pull out a pipe organ to play a song and give an evil monologue as he dragged his enemies to death -- the only reason this seems to have been cut is because gameplay is too fast for it. (ngl, I want this REALLY BAD)

* [One scrapped ability had him fire a cluster bomb that created a minefield which feared enemies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6phsnt/were_the_rioters_that_did_the_urgot_update_get/dkphfdc/) ""Unfair"" doesn't begin to describe it.

**VI**: [One early stab at her ""Piltover Enforcer"" idea was that she was a steampunk capoeira fighter with dreads and robot legs.](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2768187&page=89#post32168584) It apparently sounds cooler than it actually looked.

**WARWICK**: [One idea for his 2017 VGU was to be able to turn other allies into werewolves, allowing them to roam around the map as a wolf pack.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5ojzga/we_are_the_teams_behind_the_warwick_vgu_aua/dcjvklw/) Not exactly ""Warwick"", but very cool.

**YORICK**: [One ability was tried out for his 2016 VGU](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/jAATvLlB-yorick-mori-remembered-af-dev-team-qa?comment=00100000) where could resurrect allies, [with one version of them exploding like Kog'Maw.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/jAATvLlB-yorick-mori-remembered-af-dev-team-qa?comment=000c0001) It was cut because 1) there wasn't a way to make it fun, and 2) this meant Yorick's power relied on his team dying.

**YUUMI**:

* [Her passive was ""very close"" to being named ""Protecc/Attacc""/](https://twitter.com/Jellbug/status/1121871546899767296)
* [Few different cool](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/bpfkfd/were_the_rioters_that_created_yuumi_meow_us/ensqquw/?context=3) [abilities were tested,](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/bpfkfd/were_the_rioters_that_created_yuumi_meow_us/enss8l0/?context=3), including one ultimate that involved diving onto an enemy and pushing them an unlimited distance away from the fight (which sounds like Stukov's shoving ult from HOTS).

**CANCELLED CHAMPIONS**:

* [OMEN was a very early champ that looked like a spiky quadruped demon thing.](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Omen) He had a kit, but it was super confused and unfocused, and nobody was sure if he was meant to be melee or not.

* [KOMACHI was once supposed to be a female, Grim Reaper-style, scythe-wielding tank](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1857974&page=7#post21376091) who was being designed, but they canned her when they realized they couldn't make her not cliche. (which makes Kayn's existence as a deliberate edgelord even funnier, lol)

* [WELL was envisioned as a water elemental early in the game's life.](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Well) He was called off when someone asked Riot if they actually had the graphics technology to make him look good, and they didn't. When they soon did, they gave the concept another shot in the form of Seth, a sand mage which became Azir (listed above)

* [PRISCILLA was a ""Spider Queen"" champion](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Priscilla) who was canned despite her model and voice lines being found in the game. [Fan petition for her inclusion](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=624793) led to the creation of Elise.

* [KADARIN was a ""space marine-styled gladiator"" who had a pretty neat history](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4bejgo/possible_new_champion_kadarin_designed_by_samuel/): TotalBiscuit (RIP) won a prize in the now-defunct Refer-A-Friend system where he could help cocreate a champion, but when his idea got rejected, he gave the prize to the Make a Wish Foundation. Kadarin is a concept proposed by a kid named Samuel, but while an experimental prototype was tested, ""it's unlikely you'll ever see Kadarin as a full package.""

* [HUSK was a champion idea designed by IronStylus before he left Riot](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/4WvaL), whose design elements inspired Kai'Sa and Camille. Her story was that she was Caitlyn's former partner, but she was betrayed and paralyzed, so she defected to Zaun and formed a mercenary group called H.I.V.E."|Number9Robotic|False|https://redd.it/ek3pwt|537|0.97|0|120|1|leagueoflegends

ekwb73|2020-01-06 16:24:05|I rent skins all the time and I will NOT apologize for it.|"This is me. This is how I win. 

I see opportunity in every skin shard I get. I rent them. I spend a week playing them, and then I never touch them again. Why? Easy. Every one of them is a bet. The stakes are simple: I win if I hate the skin. It doesn't matter that I can't actually get it because I didn't want it anyway. But if I love that skin so much I want to buy it, I lose. Because I took my only chance to get a skin I wanted without paying and totally threw it down the toilet. 

You may be thinking to yourself that’s the dumbest bet I ever heard of. Well I disagree. I disagree. You like to win, right? This is no different than that. I haven't won an actual game of league since 2017. But this? This is my win. 

It started with Hired Gun Lucian. I got the skin shard, and I loved the splash art. It looked super cool. But I couldn't tell if I actually wanted it. I rented it. I made a bet, and guess what? Here's the thing: I hit. Hired Gun Lucian is truly hideous in game. The clunky animations and off-putting sounds made going 0/8/2 even more frustrating. But thanks to my rental, I saved a cool 975 RP, and all it cost was a week of my time and the theft of my dignity. 

I've been able to avoid dozens of truly horrific skins by renting them. Rusty Blitzcrank, Black Belt Udyr, Nightmare Cho'Gath, literally every Vayne skin. And more. That's the thing. They say you can see the whole universe in ugly skins. And I do. 

Every time I open a chest or get enough pass points for an orb, my heart starts racing. I can't get enough of it. I just got a shard for Sugar Rush Braum. And as soon as I saw it, I rented it immediately. I didn't even have to look up the splash art or anything. I made a crazy risk, a gamble, and it’s about to payoff."|Tortious_Tortoise|False|https://redd.it/ekwb73|0|0.36|0|13|1|leagueoflegends

You would be able to buy items anywhere on the map.

You'd pick a champion and a place on the map to spawn. From there on, it's every man for himself. Killing an enemy champion grants bonus gold (and so do assists). Of course there's the standard  shrinking circle to limit the map size over time.

ejz3y4|2020-01-04 17:01:00|UPDATE: League of Legends esports culture is spreading to high schools fast and I love it.|"Edit because I forgot to include original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9x8msa/league\_of\_legends\_esports\_culture\_is\_spreading\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9x8msa/league_of_legends_esports_culture_is_spreading_to/)

About a year ago I talked about how esports was spreading to schools rapidly and how (as the title nods) I love it. It was posted on this subreddit, it still remains my top post to this day.

Well let me tell you about the results a year later. I was one of the founders of the team. We had one team at first, my coach only had a few students to work with since he didn't announce the esports program to our school yet. At the time of 2nd semester, we had about 7 students to work with and we fought a neighboring school in our district, who smashed us due to have Plat average players and we had Silver average players (I'm only silver rip.) That didn't last too long though, we publicized our esports program to the whole school and two teams to satisfy the amount of new members we were potentially getting. My spot as a player on the main team was soon gone as we got two diamond players and a gold player, which added on to our already gold mid laner and top laner who was Plat in Korea before he moved here (Literally Korean Import LOL.)

So that was cool, after the year was over we had a bunch of summer practices, my teacher established both of our teams as Varsity and Junior Varsity and when the year started, that's when everything got groovy. A few months after school started, the season started and we started competing with playvs and CHSAA holding the season. Our Varsity team proceeded to go 16-0 against 18 other teams in our entire state state, **yes our entire state!**

Proof:  [https://imgur.com/a/FMckRjF](https://imgur.com/a/FMckRjF)

As you know from the picture, we're 16-0 with our amazing Varsity teams who are now going to playoffs with a bye. (School names were hidden so we don't get doxxed lol.) Our Junior Varsity (due to financial issues on the players side) is not competing unfortunately, instead we are readying to get on the Varsity team which have 3 seniors.

I think what makes this so special to me is that our school is not the best. In fact, not a lot of people like it. It's considered to be in the ghetto and many students in our attendance zone choose to open enroll to rival schools to get a better education. This makes for poor funding and a handful a fights. I find it amazing that we managed to get to 2 diamond players in an underpopulated school that was about to shutdown more times then you could count. It's also unbelievable that the school who was previously 14-0 with us is one with 5x as much students as ours (5000 of them!) They have way less minority and is sponsored heavily, an NFL players' kid goes there! There were also rumors that they had 4 Diamond players and we **still** beat them. It amazed me that my school who is heavily looked down upon, (often my school is used to insult me and my friends by others) is currently the only undefeated school in our state.

**TL;DR: My school's (considered to be in the ghetto) varsity team is 16-0 out of our whole state and going to playoffs.**"|ilikecamperz|False|https://redd.it/ejz3y4|1172|0.89|0|150|1|leagueoflegends

ekkiln|2020-01-05 22:57:37|It is such a chore to keep up in experience in the current jungle|"And by chore I mean its nearly impossible.  Even in games I'm doing *extremely* well, I find myself 1-2 sometimes 3 levels behind my laners, and often have a full item less than my support by the end of the game.

Jungling in the first 5-10 minutes of the game is pretty fine, honestly.  Maybe even the first 15, sometimes the first 20.  But when towers start falling and your presence is required freakin everywhere on the map all at once, and you start having to skip camps to go help a team fight or go help a counter gank, you start to fall behind INCREDIBLY fast.

If you're not just farming 24/7, its not uncommon to be 2-3 levels behind by the end of the game even if you play well.  If something happens where you fail a gank, or get invaded,  or get killed in your jungle -- you're just totally screwed.  I've seen junglers fall 3-5 levels behind by the end of a game if they died more than 2-4 times.

Its so goddamn punishing.

And then you've got asshat laners that don't understand the current jungle changes running through your jungle taking all your jungle camps.  Puts you even further behind.  Then its ""OMG JG DIFF"" if you end up losing.

I honestly really enjoy the current jungle changes for the early part of the game before towers fall.  I like what they've done with drakes, I really enjoy the XP changes and what they've done for pathing diversity.  I enjoy the map re-skins, I like ***A LOT*** of things about the new jungle.

but they really, REALLY need to scrutinize the mid and late game jungle experience."|squeezy102|False|https://redd.it/ekkiln|3|0.6|0|11|1|leagueoflegends

First Game:  
We got matched with 3 Gold I persons, one mid gold and one silver I (with 2 of three promo games won, lucks you...). We were utterly destroyed.

1/10 played => ranked all around bronce.

Next game the same... all enemy players upper gold and 1-2 silver players?  
another utterly destruction of our team.

And you can guess the third game. Also 4 Gold enemies and one silver I guy.  
We even got a pretty good lead. Enemy Jungler did go AFK. But still lost the game 4v5 as there is no fucking way to play against high gold with two people who actually new to the game

ekohf8|2020-01-06 04:01:42|Is it possible to rise out of Iron as a soloq support.|"I know as a fact you guys here love when angry players go on rants so here's a good one

for real though hear me out on this one

I'm a support main. Started out with Sona a few years ago because she was fun and very good at the time, then I moved to onetrick Anivia support and that was fun as fuck. I learned the ways of Leona recently and I've gone on to get a pretty decent track record with her.

Started playing ranked for preseason, just for fun. What I've found is horribly depressing. After winning a game full of golds, I got placed into Iron II as my base rank. Alright, kinda weird, I didn't feed or anything, I went 4/6/32, but w/e I guess. I started queueing into more games and so far I've found that it really does not matter how good I play as leona, doesn't matter how many combos I can get off. If my team is perpetually fighting a 3v5 because one person is dealing with a splitpusher and one is randomly wandering around, my CC doesn't help much. 

I think I'm doing all of the support stuff right, too. My vision score is always good, ward placement is solid. I use Blitz.gg to give me feedback on my play and I consistently get things like CC bot, all-seeing (high VS), and Unlucky.

Am I just supposed to play supports that can roll face on their own and don't require a team to do well as? Is Leona the wrong support for Iron elo? Do these problems go away in higher elos where players typically have some semblance of game sense and map awareness?

-hopeless leona main

tl;dr: I can't tell if I'm ass or if I'm getting really unlucky with my teams in ranked. Leona feels useless in Iron.

Edit: No, thank you. I enjoy playing support. You don't need to tell me to switch to a new role. I play best in support."|sktbrdr87|False|https://redd.it/ekohf8|1|0.57|0|40|1|leagueoflegends

And also because they made it really hard to balance some champs to the point where they had to keep their costs high in case someone was stacking pots in lane?

>!OG players know the terror of Yorick who walked into lane with Crystalline Flash, two health potions and two mana potions.!<

>[Our decision to remove mana pots goes along the same philosophy as starting items. 100 mana tends to benefit certain types of champions over others (with mana costs being balanced against individual champion kits) and can wildly shift from being a mediocre purchase to a very cost-efficient one. By removing mana pots, we can better balance champion ability costs with the mana regeneration stat while also streamlining the ‘sustain game’ of League.](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/preseason-2016-crests-horizon)

And with the start of preseason Presence of mind was changed so that it also increases your maximum mana by 100 on kill or assist up to a total of 500...

So here i am asking, what is the point of mana anymore?

**Edit:** A few people are making the case of ""It's only fair because manaless champions get to spam their abilities without consequence so why shouldn't mana reliant champions be able to do the same?"" 

My answer to that is BECAUSE THEY HAVE MANA and are balanced around not only having mana but also managing it, but if you don't have to worry about managing it then you just get to reap the rewards that being mana reliant brings and not suffer any of the consequences...

If having mana is going to be reduced to a minor hindrance in the beginning and then you never think about it again i don't understand what the point of it is!

And yes ""there isn't a single point in the game where mana is ever an issue."" is a hyperbolic statement thought i'd clarify because there were people grilling me about it."|BubblyEvening|False|https://redd.it/ejxkxp|772|0.72|0|843|1|leagueoflegends

ekkkvh|2020-01-05 23:02:06|Is League worth getting into again?|"**Disclaimer, these first few paragraphs are just some backstory of my history with League. It's not essential to the post, but it helps give context to my situation and questions.** 

&#x200B;

I started playing League in 2011. I believe Ahri was the newest champion. I got really into it but I was never really that good. I was looking up builds, guides, etc. Most of my irl friends played it regularly and most of them were much better than me. We played together a lot but eventually they wanted me to start playing ranked because a lot of them weren't that interested in casual games. 

&#x200B;

I was pretty hesitant on the idea because I had a pretty negative impression of the community at this point. Most games were filled with loads of toxic people and if I was even slightly behind I would get trash talked into oblivion. Most of the time I just ignored it and carried on because I only played casuals, so it didn't seem like a huge deal to me. But I thought that if people were this toxic and try-hard in casual, ranked must be unbearable. 

&#x200B;

And I was right, ranked *sucked*. I had been playing for about a year before I jumped into ranked. I never played solo queue because of nerves, but I would usually do horrible and probably drag the team down. I got kinda carried in my placements and ended up in low gold. I ended up dropping to silver over the course of about a month. I told my friends I didn't want to play ranked anymore because I was just hurting their ranks and I just wanted to play casuals anyway. They would always say ""No dude it's fine, we don't care about our ranks. We just like the fact that we can ban champs and less people troll."" But that felt like it wasn't the case, cause every time we would do poorly or lose my friends would get pretty upset about it and I felt as if they were angry at me but didn't wanna say anything. 

&#x200B;

Then they did start saying stuff to me about my performance, and this really turned me off from ranked. We all ended up getting in a fight after a ranked game and I decided to just play casuals from now on but they never really wanted to, so I would solo queue or duo queue with a different friend. Eventually he quit League around season 4, and with no one to duo queue with I quit shortly after. I think Azir had just come out. 

&#x200B;

**Backstory stuff over.**

&#x200B;

I tried to pick it back up in like season 7 but the community was just as toxic as ever and there were so many new things like those little plants, new items, reworks to items and champs, and a bunch of new champs I didn't understand so I only played for about a week before uninstalling. 

I've been thinking about trying to pick it back up again, but I'm not sure if it would be worth it.

This 2020 LCS team preview is for those in the latter group. This is meant to be a parody of Deadspin's WYTS NFL team previews. I'm a salty LCS Redditor who's near the end of his rope watching these teams shoot themselves in their collective feet, so I inhaled a few markers and made this. I might make more. Enjoy.*

---

**Your Team:** [Cloud9](https://dotesports-media.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/19130014/c9cosplay.png), aka the esports equivalent of Playboy magazine. Seriously, how many people have busted a nut to stuff like [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDA1GIgU8AE54K9.jpg)? You know who you are, I just want you to know I'm silently judging you from behind my sticky keyboard.

&nbsp;

**Your 2019 Record:** Before I start shitting on them mercilessly, I'll give C9 a bit of credit. No team in the LCS is better at developing and using talents to their max potential than Cloud9. Unfortunately, they have a bad habit of being the LCS equivalent of the Tennessee Titans: A glorified farm system designed to grow then sell off players to teams desperate for slightly above average NA talent because they can't be assed to do it themselves. Jack won't tell you this, and he hasn't won any titles in years, but you know what he's getting out of all of this....

Anyway. *Jensen,* probably the League's greatest coattail-hanger of all time (yeah I said it, shoot me) got fed up of all the C9 craziness and losing in finals because he can't press buttons in key moments to save his life. He skips off to TL, so C9 is forced to look for other options. *Goldenglue?* Fuck no. Simple math: Goldenglue is NA and NA is bad, therefore Goldenglue is bad. It's math, can't dispute. C9 says fuck it and picks up some random mid from Europe, [*Snitsky*](https://youtu.be/ijeNT3mWVok?t=118).

No more import slots, so the rest of the team is back on board for 2019. Spring is here, the team abuses strong roster continuity while occasionally swapping in Glue & Blaber to [flex](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DBa-lnXVYAAgcXD.jpg) on weaker teams on the way to a 2nd place finish. Things are looking good, they're up 2-0 on TSM in Semis, then Bjergsen goes [b-a-n-a-n-a-s](https://youtu.be/yhEbVwbyu7s?t=212) on Akali to reverse sweep C9 and send them home early.

>Game 5 in the playoffs and Reapered lets his star top laner pick Ornn into Braum. It's also blind so he gets fucked in fights AND in lane

>Coach of the split right there

- /u/Todeswucht

Okay summertime is here, that series was a fluke that we only lost because our coach forgot what a counter-pick was. Aside from a few hiccups (RN-Jesus claiming Licorice's wrists for a few weeks, bringing in Deftly for a few games because Sneaky's patreon was losing subs and he needed to get it back up) they finish 2nd because NA has somehow gotten *worse.* Fucking NA man. C9 quickly dispatches CLG and meets up w/ C9 for their long awaited re-match. This is the year right? TL is looking weak after their 5 game set with Clutch, so this is perhaps their best chance, right??

[NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPE](https://streamable.com/0pkyn)

It goes to 5 games, but nothing is more representative of DL vs Sneaky historically than DL giving him a hard [ass-pounding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v_NEyBudlE) in a super-important series. Hashinshin is rolling in his grave.

But it's okay. C9 always gets their revenge at worlds, no matter how bad the circumstances, C9 will get out of groups and at least be competitive. Then the group draw happened. I won't waste time describing how C9 did in groups, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SKXU1u3dIo) is already plenty descriptive enough. 2-4, out in groups, NA's suffering continues.

&nbsp;

**Your Coach:** Reapered, Westrice, Rapidstar, and ~~GameOver~~ Reignover. Close call for Reapered. He was on the verge of getting [Fortunate Son'd](https://youtu.be/N7qkQewyubs?t=13) by the Korean military before getting an extension, so he'll be here for the immediate future. Aside from probably costing a shit ton and inexplicably troll drafting during key games, there's not much to complain about. Hey, and Reignover's back! Back from his Korean exile after mercilessly absorbing millions from CLG, RO joins up on C9 to teach *Blaber* how to play Olaf and...that's pretty much it.

&nbsp;

**What's new that sucks:** C9 fans, it's time to [PAY THE TOLL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtOEig1l8SA). In today's LCS, you can't have your cake and eat it too. TL has won that last 4 LCS titles in a row, and it's clear that Twizzlers & Snitsky are itching for an LCS win. So that means it's bye-bye to to poor *Sneaky*. At least we'll have [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/FRodWLI) great spank bank material to remember him by. Oh, and both Sven/Zeyzal gone too, off to whatever the hell EG is doing (Jiizuke, lol. Enjoy NA soloQ). [Jack's getting paid tho](https://streamable.com/k5wo5), so it's all good.

*""[Did somebody say invade?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w6zy8R6WNw)""*

- C9 Blaber, every fucking game

Fresh from a disastrous split on TSM, *Zven* is here! Jack is back it *Wolf of Wall Street* style, buying low on disgraced Europeans that came to NA to cash out. Provided *Vulcan* can keep Zven from choking on his food (or DL's dong) long enough to let top side carry, this is actually could be a scary roster. 

""I would have paid $2.5 million for Vulcan, but don't tell DIG that""

>They've stopped doing that for years now apparently. As a long time fan of the original roster which C9 stubbornly kept together even through tough times, you can really tell the team building is different now. They're just there to act as a talent agency and don't care about winning major events anymore. They just want the squads to reach Worlds every year and then sell them off after since they essentially have a ""Worlds quality"" team. It also helps that their history as an org makes any players, no matter how bad they are, automatically gain value in the eyes of others, after all, they're the clutch master and the meme team, what's not to love :/

ek8u8p|2020-01-05 05:42:02|"I tracked 100 games of ""Fill"" on Flex Queue. Results:"|" Hi all, I was very curious what the difference in role is between filling in Flex and filling is Solo/Duo. So here is part 1, not titled such because it'll be another few months to get in another 100 games haha. Finished 45 wins and 55 losses. Jungle and ADC were my only winning percent lanes (20-18 Jungle, 7-6 Bot).  

[First things first, here is the raw stats of role, W/L](https://imgur.com/a/8XzuF65)  

[And here is the champions data for played and W/L](https://imgur.com/a/MSTqBBt) (Note: Champs are generally in their role, Senna was always support, the one Vayne game was Top and the Morg win was Mid, and I had one game of Noc mid, otherwise no off-role shenanigans happened).  

What I learned? I am actually not a bad jungler. I always avoided it like the plague, but finding a champ I was good at made it not so bad (Nocturne). I also discovered that I was correct in the knowledge that I suck at top lane haha.  

Longest win streak was 5, longest losing streak was 8. I bounced between Gold IV and Gold II throughout, which isn't abnormal for me. Getting Jungle and Support for 69% (heh) was not surprising, and I don't feel I will see much difference in the Solo/Duo queue aside from maybe less support with duos going bot sometimes. I not surprisingly also learned that the more you play a champ, the more you win with them over time. I plan on playing a much SMALLER range of champs in solo/duo to see how it affects my overall win rate, though that's not GREAT data because flex queue has some WILD match-ups elo wise, like my last game where my team had two diamonds, two irons as a foursome and me in gold versus 4 golds and a silver.  

Anyway, if other curiosities arise let me know, I tracked by game. The longest run in any role was 3 in a row (Supp had it happen 3 times, Jungle once), the longest drought was 37 games between getting Mid."|minos157|False|https://redd.it/ek8u8p|38|0.81|0|37|1|leagueoflegends

ekh9vf|2020-01-05 18:58:25|[Satire] How I went from a 0LP silver 4 Vayne Main to a Rank One Challenger Janna Main|"I am a 1 million mastery vayne main, although I'm silver I'm basically Gosu on vayne. I would never lose lane if not for my shit junglers or afk supports. Anyway, the other day I was playing with this Janna support and, of course, she basically inted me. When I rightfully flamed her she said something along lines of Janna was a hard champ or something. To be quite honest I don't know exactly what she said. I wasn't really paying attention to chat as I was focusing on my flawless 4.6 CS per minute. 

Long story short, as I was staring at my 0lp silver 4 screen I had an idea better than the time I went ap vayne, at that moment I decided I would become a support main. I remembers something along the line of tyler1 saying something like support is an op role and braindead. So I bought Janna with the little RP I had left from my stealing mom's credit card and thus began my journey.

This is my diary.

**Day 1:** I lost all of my games today cause my jungler was still shit like always, but damn support is pretty easy easy I run up and click w and the enemy adc runs away my adc's always suck and I watch them with contempt wondering why my adc won't kill the nautilus after I tanked his whole combo and died. I even ward baron at 30 min when it spawns so I know it's not my fault.

**Day: 7** thus ends my first week as a support main. All things considered I went 50% winrate on Janna which was better than my 46% winrate on Vayne. I decided to learn Janna a bit more so I've starting to watch some Janna streamers and read /r/jannamains for tips.

**Month 1:** I really starting to win games a lot more. I no longer go full ap and max wqe instead I max E shield and rush ardent for my adc. I've stopped flaming my adc as well, because I think it's cute to see them struggle of course, my adc is still better but they're twying their best. I read something that being supportive to your teammates make you win more games I've started typing encouragement to them. Like ""you can do it!"" or something IDK they still suck tho.

**Month 2:** I hit gold >.< i can finally get the new skin. It's getting hwarder to play Janna and I'm little embarrassed when I play bad :3, but the other day my brother saw me playing Janna. He gave me this bottle of pills and said they're performance enhancing like Tyler1 bloodrush except  they're fow support mains and told me to take them. The bottle said ""spironolactone"" or something.

**Month 6:** Boy those pills are swomething. My skin got softer and my chest feels a bit heavier. Which is weird since they make my stomach a little upset and I've actuawy wost weight from not eating. I've gone from from my healthy good boi 300 Lbs 5'6 to 130 Lbs. I feel healthier now. I also picked up watching some anime just light stuff like Fwullmetal Alchemist and Fate Zero, and I stwarted stweaming too.

**Month 9:** I've hit plat ~(´･ω･`)~.  My Aniki gave me some more pills :D. They say something like estradiol on them. My fwive viewers told me to put on a face cam and once I did I instantly got a 10$ dono I'm so happy (─‿‿─) so I thwink I going to kweep my cam up for my kittens~. They cUwUed me a QTpie which is such a nyice compwiment since I think QTpie is a tawented pwayer.


**1 Year** I did it I finyawwy hit Diamond >w<  I don't weawwy wemembew why I stwarted pwaying Jannya but it's okay ｡ﾟ･ (>﹏<) ･ﾟ. The othew day my adc wasn't doing that gweat, but I towd him he was cute~ and then he stwarted cawwying me and we won! Yay! waeta I got fwiend wequest fwom a chawwenguwu account  I accepted the reqwuest and I was swoooo nyewvous (⊙_⊙).

ekt4pv|2020-01-06 11:51:07|Let's be honest about Aphelios|"Okay, so I think it's really time to be honest about this champ. It **definetly** is interesting and very unique champ! But, unfortunately, it is not the champ we need and want in League. And why? Because it is against one basic rule of literally every other champion ingame - **easy to understand/learn - hard to master!**

Like many said before, it is really hard to even understand what this champion does and most of the times you will not know what is he doing or what he can do even after FEW GAMES played against him!*I mean from my personal experience if you don't play toplane for example and suddenly you are autofilled there and for the first time you are laning against Fiora, Illaoi, Jax - you will probably get caught offguard in early game since you don't understand your matchup. But after a few minutes, you'll get the hang of it because it's easy to reckognize all the abilitties and what the enemy champ can do and when!*

**BUT!** If you play a whole game! And not a single one! I literally played like 5 games against Aphelios and still got suprised about how he could kill me, poke me, dmg me etc. And it's all just because of how hard he is to read!!

Now the only question stands - what can we do with this champion?I am not saying cut it out of the game, hardly nerf it or anything like that. I think it seriously needs to be reworked slightly.For example I think that the ""offhand"" think is just too much. Let's make it easier, please!

So, **my idea, maybe**..?

**Calibrum - Long range sniper rifle  - high dmg, slower attack speed**

Q - bolt of energy, dmg to the first guy it hits

R - across map target ult that can't be blocked by other champs, but can be applied only on champs that were hit by Aphelios AA in last 5?6?7? seconds (so u can't ult like Cait based just on vision)

**Severum - normal range**

Q - passive - autoattacks heal you based on lvl

R - Aphelios gains movement speed and bonus lifesteal (keeps it even if u switch weapon right after using it?)

**Gravitum - normal range**

Q - slowing enemies that were hit by AA

R - all enemies hit by ANY aa from ANY of Aphelios weapon get rooted

**Infernum - normal range**

Q - passive - burns enemies overtime when hit by AA (like twitch poison)

R - massive aoe dmg - the more enemies are in an energy cone you shot, the more dmg you do (but not as OP as now ROFL)

**Crescendum - short range, higher attack speed**

Q - throw the weapon at one closest enemy, it disarmes them for 2 secs, immidiately bounces back and shields you (can't aa during the animation)

R - throw the weapon at all enemies in a close distance to you, it disarmes them for 1 sec, immiditely bounces back and shields you (shield depends on how many enemies you hit, and u can't aa during the animation)

&#x200B;

**W - changing weapons** (you still have only limited ammo on each gun)

**E - passive ability** different based on what weapon u have equipped

**Calibrum** \- higher range based on E lvl

**Severum** \- higher lifesteal based on E lvl

**Gravitum** \- bigger slow based on E lvl

**Infernum** \- the burn dmg gets higher based on E lvl

**Crescendum** \- your attack speed gets higher based on E lvl

&#x200B;

So my idea is that if you combine the weapons well in different situations, you can actually use it in a very unique and strong way. But it's easier to understand for enemies what are u actually doing!

For example if u get engaged and u have Severum, u can press R and then switch to Crescendum, so you can actually survive if caught off position or get ganked.

You would still have 5 different Q abilities, and 5 different R abilitties + passive ability, which is I think still unique like it was intended in a first place and it might be actually very strong!"|MoRs222|False|https://redd.it/ekt4pv|0|0.08|0|0|1|leagueoflegends

The thing is this its not 2011 the games are a lot faster and in an extended teamfight where other champions are spamming the keyboard with their heads, rumble cant do shit, especially if he was forced to use W E defensively at the start of the fight. A fight breaks down you do your shit get silenced and then you have to pull back FOR 6 SECONDS because you are a little more useless than a super minion   6   WHOLE   SECONDS. REMOVE the silence and make him get slowed OR remove the silence and the extra damage on hit (which is useless) and make his abilities gain special effects if he gets over heated when he uses it.

ekrsx2|2020-01-06 09:29:44|Aphelios isn’t that difficult nor is he that overpowered (with one exception) you just haven’t read his abilities enough.|"Aphelios is certainly not weak but he’s also not overpowered. 

Here’s a rundown on his abilities simply:

Sniper Shooty Gun: Extra Range on basic attacks. Abilities that use this weapon place marks on enemies which shoot your offhand weapon onto that enemy from any range. Q: Skillshot that applies a mark. R: Puts down marks which do extra damage.

Red scythe gun: Gives lifesteal and overheal shield. Q: run faster and do repeated attacks for a few seconds. R: Heal 300 HP

Purple Orb Gun: Slows when you hit them. Q: Roots and does extra damage. R: Slows 99%.

Blue splash damage gun: does splash damage behind your autoattacks. Q: uses your offhand weapon to deal damage in a cone in front of you. R: Extra damage. This is broken (if you hit 5 then the splash damage hits everyone 5 extra times)

Chakram white gun: Attack speed limited on your chakram coming back. So if you’re closer you can shoot more. If you use an ability that makes use of this as your offhand ability, you get more chakrams and do more damage per auto. Q: Sentry that uses your offhand weapon. Doesn’t last long. R: More damage and chakrams 

COMBO PRIMER:

Sniper gun + Purple orb gun: Use sniper gun Q and then switch to orb gun q for a quick root from far range.

Splash damage gun + purple orb gun: splash damage Q then switch to orb gun q for a AOE root.

Chakram gun + Sniper gun: Use sentry to get marks on enemies and do lots of damage from a far. 

Splash damage gun + lots of enemies: use ult. Unless you’re inting they’re all gunna die.

Those are the best combos I’ve found but there are more. Those are particularly strong though.

Now, here are the best times to go on Aphelios!

Before 6, he is very weak with Infernum/ splash damage gun. It’s not very strong and doesn’t pair well with most offhand weapons early game. He is also weak with the red scythe gun as he won’t be healing a lot. He does not have great escape aside from his red scythe guns ability so if he wastes it, that would be a good time to go on him.  

His sentry has low cast range and range, so stay away from him and kill it if you can. You can also activate it to make it die faster. 

His ult doesn’t do a lot of damage if you’re not together so try not to clump. 

I hope this will make playing against Aphelios an easier experience. I’ve found that as long as you respect his weapon he isn’t too hard to kill. And yes, you can see both of his weapons on him. Just look - they’re there."|anton5009|False|https://redd.it/ekrsx2|0|0.36|0|23|1|leagueoflegends

My first game, top laner has died 5 times at ~6 mins, then proceeded to carry on dying with 12 deaths at 12 minutes, if not more, but that’s not the worst part. 

I’m a jungler, so obviously we need to be present on the map, which in my case, I felt like I was quite present in this game (invaded their jungler, got first blood+ their red, then went their bot side, stole gromp and killed the jungler again), needless to say, I’m ahead against their jungler, I ganked mid successfully and we got a kill, then drake and then bot (one kill and flash burned). 

I decided to look, and by the time all of this was completed, our top was 0/4 and I came in to try and help but the enemy top was already too strong. 

The game then went to shit and top ended with 1/19 (the one kill was literally a last hit as well, just to add more humour to this tumour :>), and some point in the game the top decided to come up with a new excuse I’ve not heard before - “don’t you see what I’m doing? I’m jungle training, if you don’t gank, I go in” ...

Great game after all, hope you enjoyed my story from my gold promos(although from this shit I would’ve said it’s probably iron mentality, more likely).

Some background to where this is coming from: A couple of days ago I decided I'd give LoL a try again, it's been almost two years since I've played but I kept up with changes to the game through YouTube content and such. I played enough normals to get back to the point where I have as firm of a grasp of the game as I had before I 'quit'. Today I decided to have a go at ranked again.   
I got matched in/against a gold 1/2 team, which struck me as odd since I've never really been anything above silver. (am trash) However, considering it was my first game I figured the system might've just been a bit wonky. After an (not unexpectedly) embarrassing loss I got my provisional rank: silver 5. Cool, that's about where I left off, time to learn and improve. I Q for the next game: everyone is plat 3 or above. Not exactly an enjoyable match, as I'm clearly out-skilled and naturally I get blasted once again, ruining not only my own enjoyment but also my entire teams'.  This repeats for 2 more games, I've now gotten destroyed 4 times in a row, each and every time I've more or less caused my team to lose which means 16 people (+me) have had trash games and I've receive constant flame for something that's mostly out of my control.   


Which leads me to my question: is this account permaf\*cked in terms of elo? At this rate, I have no interest to continue playing not only because there's no fun in in for me, but because I'm wrecking the games of my teammates and getting rightfully flamed for it. Anything I can do?

ejubnd|2020-01-04 08:55:01|It's ironic that Soraka, a defensive healer with low damage and a really friendly personality, can create so much tilt|"I'm not excluded from this. Even though the problem rarely is the Soraka herself - I usually hate her because her heals prevent me from shutting down their cocky, T7-spamming 10/0 Caitlyn, who would have deserved to die a long, long time ago. 

The targeted enemy is low, your goal of killing him and winning the teamfight is in grab range. Then it's delayed by a Soraka W. Then again. Then again. Then she ults and it's like ""HOLY sh*t, we never had a chance"". Our team is dead, their carry still runs around and it's all due to that stupid unicorn. 

I don't even want to hate Soraka, she is a really nice person without any potentially annoying traits (like a Lulu laugh some people would dislike). But damn, it's hard to not to... :/

so people have asked for more reason on why i like these gods in smite and what exactly im looking for in a champ so here you go
i love jing wei's safety im not always the smartest player so having a mix of her ult and 1-3 combo to get away is very helpful to me as well as hitting those big crits i love hou yi's outplay potential and that feeling when you land the triple bounce and almost one shot some one he is just rewarding to play i like the damage of freya but along with the jing wei play style i like the safety that freya has whether its life steal whoop or ult to get away while also dealing massive damage when it comes to both da ji and pele i just like the speed and mobility as well as the dive and one shot style but im not good at jungling in league i also like that unlike some assassins both da ji and pele have cc and teamfight presence and its not only the dive back line get a kill and get out i have an insane pele clip if you are interested message me"|ShreddedIettuce|False|https://redd.it/ekhhc0|0|0.5|0|22|1|leagueoflegends

I've recently been adding players that have been Diamond for over 3 seasons now and asking them their plans to get to Master. The majority of them stated, in different terms, that they don't care about leaving Diamond, they are playing only for fun/waste time. Some claimed they were ""smurfing"" (lol).

Not gonna lie, Yasuo design is one of the most interesting ones yet still super annoying to play against (bless CertainlyT's soul). Call me bronze but it's really hard to play against any Yasuo, not only those who main him. There are many champions that rewards players for playing many games, yet every decent Yasuo can be as good as Draven, Riven or Ryze main.

ekjwri|2020-01-05 22:15:05|If a high skillcap champion is only played by mains but has a low winrate, it doesn't mean the champion is bad.|"This is a common misconception and is important to keep in mind when discussing champions like Ryze, Azir, Kalista, Aatrox, Irelia, Akali, etc. through the years. In the periods that these champions aren't meta and their playrate decreases as a result, people will argue that if pretty much only skilled champion mains are picking them at this point, doesn't it mean that they're underpowered if their winrate is below 50%?

The answer is no. You shouldn't actually trust champion main subreddits and especially not players who bring up their champion mastery score because they're shy about posting what their actual rank is.

Let's say you're an average player, you play in an average elo. You see a Malphite on your team, he's gold. At a crucial moment in the game, he goes for a max range flash-R initiation on the lone Gangplank on the enemy team and is immediately burst down, not just because he's the only one even close to them at the moment but because he missed the R on Gangplank, went full AP even though your team has no tank, and forgot to use his Zhonya's active. Enraged, you [op](https://op.gg)gg him for material to flame him with. He's an Azir one trick with 7000 games played on the champion, but only a 49% winrate on him.

This is your average Ryze, Akali, Azir, etc. main. Do you actually believe that this Malphite is able to play Azir competently just because he plays Azir a lot? Don't be mislead. If you were to look at that guy's post history, he probably makes 10 comments a day in his champion main subreddit (not even including the Discord) shilling his latest revolutionary Gunblade Randuins Azir build he's theorycrafted for maximum gold efficiency.

When one of these champions is out of meta, what's actually happening most of the time is that they're not -bad- but instead -balanced- and people are being filtered."|Magehunter_Skassi|False|https://redd.it/ekjwri|0|0.37|0|10|1|leagueoflegends

***Moxxi, The Caretaker***

**I'm Fine \[Passive\]**  
Whenever Moxxi gets damaged, *40% (+ 0.5% of Moxxi's maximum health) (+ 30% AP)* of her lost health gets grayed out, up to a cap of 100%,. After not being in combat for 3 seconds, the grayed out health is slowly transfered to all allies near her equally.

Adiotionally, damaging enemy champions reduces her cooldowns on all her abilities by 1 second (this effect has a 20 scaling down to 12 (depending on level) second cooldown.)

\-

**Courageous Charge \[Q\]**

Moxxi charges forward with her sword and shield. While charging, she holds her shield in front of her, reducing all incoming damage by *10% (+ 0.2% of Moxxi's maximum health)*. At the end of the charge, she stops and slashes with her sword, dealing *50/90/130/170/210 (+ 70% AD) (+ 3.5% of Moxxi's maximum health)* as physical damage, and slowing enemies for *13/16/19/22/25% (+ 0.5% of Moxxi's maximum health)*.

Whenever an enemy is hit by this ability, they are marked for 4 seconds. Enemies marked that get hit by this ability once again will get stunned for 1 second.

If hit during the charge, apart from reducing the damage, she empowers her crowd control, adding 10% more slow, or 0.5 more seconds of stun time.  
**\[Cooldown: 22/20/18/16/14s\]**  
\-

**Finish Them! \[W\]**

Moxxi holds her blade with both her hands and sweeps all enemies in a circle around her. Enemies hit take *20/40/80/100/120 (+ 50% AD) (+ 2.5% of Moxxi's maximum health)* damage and are knocked up.

For each enemy hit, the cooldown on this ability is reduced by 1 second.  
**\[Cooldown: 22s\]**  
\-

**Stand Your Ground! \[E\]**

Moxxi dashes to a target ally's position and may cast this ability a second time to decide in which direction she wants to aim her shield. She remains with the ally for 1 second. The shield blocks the next enemy or ally ability that were to hit it from the front. When hit, the ally champion will recieve a shield for *50/65/70/85/100 (+ 120% AP)* health for 5 seconds, and they both get knocked back in the oppsite direction where the attack came from, gaining *15% (+ 30% AD) (+ 80% AP)* bonus movement speed decaying for 2 seconds. If the ability the shield reflected was a friendly ability, that ally also gets the movement speed bonus.

If when knocked back, she hits an enemy champion, they'll get stunned for 1 second.

Moxxi can also use this ability on herself, maintaining position for 2 seconds or until she is hit by an ability. If this is the case, the shield is instead applied to herself and is 1.5 times stronger.

This ability also refreshes her Q cooldown when succesful and empowers it, increasing its damage dealt by 10% and the range by 200 units.  
**\[Cooldown: 18/17/16/15/14s\]**  
\-

**We Shall Be Triumphant! \[R\]**

After a short channel time, Moxxi targets an enemy champion. Said champion pulls all enemies in range to their position, slowing them for *10/20/30% (+ 10% AP) (+ 1% of Moxxi's maximum health)* for 1.5 seconds.

Aditionally, she empowers her allies with a powerful inspiring war cry, giving them *10/20/30 (+ 5% AP)* more of each protections, *15/20/25% (+ 5% AP)* extra attack speed, and *10/20/30% (+ 10% AP) (+ 1% of Moxxi's maximum health)* movement speed for 4/6/8 seconds.

Basic attacks: a relatively slow firing cannon that does decent damage from a range.

Passive: minions do not target you when you are under 5% health

Q: flare: a skill shot root or stun that Make all nearby minions target who it hits. And gives them a small speed boost 

W: reinforcements: a small aoe that summons one melee minion and one ranged minion. This can be shot over walls. Lv 2 you have 2 melee and one range. Lv 3 you get a cannon lv 4 a cannon and a ranged and lv 5 you get a cannon that has Barton for 15 seconds after appearing. This will have to go through a bit of work but I’m sure that it can be balanced 

E: Fall back: you dash to a minion

R: any melee minions around you are duplicated and all minions around you are unstoppable and have increased movement speed. For like 10 seconds.

ek5o4w|2020-01-05 01:09:01|Bounties were meant to help the team who is behind catch up but they can do the exact opposite.|"I was playing ranked today and my PC crashed in loading screen. I reconnect and apparently my team was unable to remake. I'm playing Camille into Jax and he's level 6, so pretty doomed. I start roaming and manage to pick up 5 kills, even though I'm severely underfed. This is when I notice i have a 500 gold bounty, which is absolutely huge for someone who is 70 cs down at 10 minutes. At this point I was still a net 700 gold behind Jax, and almost 2 levels behind. Jax sees this obviously and dives me. We trade 1 for 1, but somehow he doesn't have a bounty even when 70 cs up, so I get 300g and he gets 800g, shooting his lead up to 1200 for no valid reason and giving him his triforce spike. Needless to say a game that could've been comebackable just became completely unplayable for me. If bounties are meant to get you back from a rough early game (or here straightup not having an early game), how in the world does a bounty spawn when I'm at a large gold deficit compared to my laner?

1. no rune customization 
   1. why? when introducing friends to league this is really important to learn for when you eventual head into ranked games.
2. shoving players into normal's with no smite available 
   1. ummm why, it can make teams very lopsided because one if even remotely smurfing can run through the jungle getting everything, ive been stomped multiple times now because of it and its not fun, a huge turn off.
3. summoner spells locked behind levels, i dont understand this it makes games wonky and not realistic of what most games will become down in the future, potentially leading to confusion for brand new players that expect aram in ranked games.
4. champ select pre normal games, its a cluster fuck out here, people calling rolls like the old days running into each other after insta locking in 2 mid laners, then watching them argue for the next 40 seconds and being pissed off at each other then eventually one afking.
   1. get rid of this pre normal ban pick phase, its not fun it creates confusion and anger at your teammates even before getting into the game, as a new player i would be turned off to this immediately if i expected this later down the road.
5. leveling up is slow i get that, riot makes money off people truly falling in love with this game as i have (spent over 800$ on my mains) but if your not going to allow players to get a lot pre ranked, at least push them hard to get to ranked. the faster they can play ranked the faster they can fall in love with the competitive nature that this game cultivates in my opinion.

these are a few examples that make beginning play very unfun and a turn off, i feel like if your brand new to the game you wont play long after getting stomped 3-10 times pre normal and pre ranked games. what are you'r thoughts let me know down below appreciate the read"|klopollo|False|https://redd.it/ekk772|0|0.41|0|14|1|leagueoflegends
ekisxa|2020-01-05 20:44:00|Champion kit #3, an Assassin|"Hello you people, have a good 2020. I'm FúrinKazan and, although a level 10 account, I'm actually close to 400 in the BR server. I recently tried to reach out to Riot about my projects for League of Legends, but unfortunately they only deal with graduated people.

Anyway, the projects I made for the game have no use anymore so I decided to publish them all. They are champion kits, counting up to 120 with unique abilities, defined classes, gameplay and numbers for those who like. The idea is to publish one champion per day until April. I also have some champion updades and they might show up sometimes.

I see a lot of good and creative kit concepts and reworks everywhere on the internet. However, if its gameplay is not coherent, it's not a champion. If numbers are not right, it won't work. Riot abandons a lot of cool fantasies because they end up failing at executon, so I bring you the abilities instead, for people to imagine a theme as they want. Here we go:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* Nō (names are merely for inspiration and representation).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Passive:** After using an ability, Nō's next basic attack is applied with her claws, gaining **100** additional range (**225** total), dealing bonus **Magic Damage** and granting her bonus **Movement Speed**.

**-Damage: 20/30/40/50 (+ 30% AP) at levels 1/6/11/16**  
**-Bonus Movement Speed: 20/40/60/80% for 0.5/0.75/1/1.25 seconds at levels 1/6/11/16**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**1st Skill:** Within **1** second, Nō quickly advances in a line and, after reaching maximum range, returns to her original position. Both moves deal damage to enemies she passes through, but only the first **slows** by **50%** for **1.5** seconds. If the advance hits an enemy, Nō returns earlier and only half the distance.

If Nō hits at least one enemy, her next basic attack within **2** seconds will leap towards her target (**575** range), dealing bonus damage.

**-Damage (advance/returnal): 20/30/40/50/60 (+ 30% AP) as Magic Damage**  
**-Bonus damage (leaping basic attack): 40/60/80/100/120 (+ 60% AP) as Magic Damage, increased by 1% for every 1% of Maximum Health the target has missing**  
**-CD: 8/7.5/7/6.5/6 seconds (begins on use)**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**2nd Skill:** Nō spins for **1.5** seconds, arms opened to both sides and claws out. She begins crouched but rises as she spin, ending on her tiptoe. The spin deals damage to enemies around her every **0.25** seconds. Nō can move while spinning.

If in the last damage instance Nō ends up hitting only one enemy, it will be **knocked up** for **1** second and take additional damage (this effect works as a basic attack, applying on-hit effects).

**-Damage every 0.25 second: 23/26/29/32/35 (+ 20% AP) as Magic Damage**  
**-Bonus damage in the last instance: 6/7/8/9/10 (+ 15% AP) x number of damage instances the enemy received (including itself)**  
**-Maximum damage: 174/198/222/246/270 (+ 210% AP) as Magic Damage**  
**-CD: 13/12/11/10/9 seconds**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**3rd Skill:** Nō launches a bomb in the targeted position. If it hits an enemy, it will explode and deal damage around itself. If it hits at least one enemy champion, Nō receives bonus **30%** **Movement Speed** when moving towards him, decaying over **3** seconds. If the bomb hits no enemy, it will stay in place (may attach itself to walls), visible but not highlighted.

The bomb increases in power for every second (up to **3** seconds) it remains static, dealing increased damage and granting more **Movement Speed** when moving agains enemy champions hit by its possible explosion.

The bomb disappears after **12** seconds.

**-Initial damage: 60/80/100/120/140 (+ 40% AP) as Magic Damage-Maximum damage (after 3 seconds): 90/120/150/180/210 (+ 60% AP) as Magic Damage-Movement Speed (after 3 seconds): 40/50/60/70/80% that decays over 3 seconds-CD: 6 seconds**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Ultimate: Passive:** Killing an enemy champion grants Nō's **Passive** **10** additional base damage.

**Active:** Nō liberates thousands of purple butterflies around her current position, creating a large area of effect around herself (its position independs of Nō once it is created) for **8** seconds. Enemies inside the area have their **sight** range reduced and a portion of their **Magic Resistance** is ignored by her. They're also unable to see Nō (be her inside or outside the cloud). Enemies outside the cloud cannot see Nō when she's inside it.

Additionally, the cloud **slows** enemies inside by **30%** and grants Nō bonus **Movement Speed**.

**-Ignored Magic Resistance: 40/60/80%**  
**-Bonus Movement Speed: 40/60/80%**  
**-CD: 100/90/80 seconds**

ejztr9|2020-01-04 17:52:49|We all need to have a real talk about leaving and AFKing in real games, because it's returned, and it's worse then ever.|"This is a real problem that I can see has influenced way too many games and feels just completely useless to report anyone. If you check their match history a week later, they're still playing games like nothing happened. What happened to leaverbuster or someone getting banned? Now the only thing you see is chat restrictions and that doesn't really curb much. The only hope to avoid it is to just hope the coinflip lands on the enemy team and not yours.

Any thoughts on how to fix this issue?"|SleepyGoodbye|False|https://redd.it/ejztr9|25|0.59|0|46|1|leagueoflegends
ekbssd|2020-01-05 11:17:56|How does mmr work? Slightly confused about it..|"My op.gg is here - https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=Dvus

Not to blow my own trumpet but I have not been losing  much lately.. at all. But my mmr is so bad that I'm only gaining 15LP per win, so I'm a little confused.

Before reaching d4 I was playing with a friend in gold for fun, perhaps that has something to do with it?

I appreciate any comments."|DvusIV|False|https://redd.it/ekbssd|0|0.4|0|4|1|leagueoflegends

ekl5tq|2020-01-05 23:43:38|the patch we need before season starts.|"*just my opinion*

change list:

**-buff lethality stats** on items but let it scale from 40% to 100% and not from 60% to 100%.

**-nerf zhonyas** (its the best item in the game. has the best build path in the game with amazing subitems. good on every champion and good into every teamcomp. good against any typ of damage.)

**-nerf the flexiablility of many AP items.**  (ludens is overloaded.  Morellonomicon shouldnt give HP. Void has to much penetration. protobelt is op, cheap and overloaded. etc.)

**-create 1 or 2 bruiser-ish ap items**

**-make MAWs shield be all damage not just magic**

**-change jungle items.** let junglers buy machete/ring and than they level up like support items and give you smite upgrade but no battle stats. so junglers dont need to waste gold on a stat check item and the op runic echo would finally be gone.

**-slightly increase base stats of adcs**

**-nerf dorans shield on ranged champions**

**-rework akali**

**-nerf mordekaiser**

**-nerf kai'sa**

**-rework sylas**

**-buff azir**

**-buff aatrox**"|Peperoniboi|False|https://redd.it/ekl5tq|0|0.29|0|46|1|leagueoflegends

It's super strong if they take off, and your team will probably not know how to punish them if they're smurfing. They do it to get high winrate and/or boost accounts, so you'll definitely meet them if you're gold elo or above."|Duuster|False|https://redd.it/ekhoq0|0|0.33|0|11|1|leagueoflegends
