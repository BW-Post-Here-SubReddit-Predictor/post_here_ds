cflsy3|2019-07-20 13:28:34|AskScience Panel of Scientists XXI|"**Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/amj68a/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xx/).

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

---

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,

* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.


------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)

* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?

* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

-----------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

       Username: /u/foretopsail
       General field: Anthropology
       Specific field: Maritime Archaeology
       Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction. 
       Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.
       Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

You can submit your application by replying to this post."|AskScienceModerator|False|https://redd.it/cflsy3|436|0.98|1|86|1|askscience

ektull|2020-01-06 13:00:15|When people lose an arm or leg, how do their veins and arteries re-route their blood?|"I am a kid from Sri Lanka, and I want to know. I want to follow up from this question here: 

""https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ekpn5q/eli5_when_people_lose_an_arm_or_leg_how_do_their/""

If someone loses an arm, even if the wound heals over, it seems like there would be a problem with their blood suddenly having no route to or from their heart.

Do doctors have to create a temporary channel for the blood to flow? People lost limbs before modern medicine, so I assume the body has a way to deal with it on it's own.

[MY QUESTION]

It sounds like you might use cauterization or some other such procedure. (I just learned what cauterization is. Thank you. Now, I need to remember how to spell it.) 

it sounds like the arteries will just take the blood to the end of the artery. And the veins will take the blood back. So, where do the arteries meet the veins? Is there some particular set of points?"|aboutcode|False|https://redd.it/ektull|27|0.76|0|10|1|askscience

I'm aware that dehydration disrupts a plethora of biological processes which leads to a variety of things going wrong in our body. But there must be one (or perhaps a few?) factor(s) that eventually lead to death.   
Is it the hypovolemic shock? Is it perhaps dyselectrolytemia?   


I have a vague memory in my mind that it's because of hyponatremia, but that doesn't make much sense. We only lose sodium through our sweat and can replenish it from food, which means if we avoid an environment that causes us to sweat and eat enough, that'll prolongue our chances of surviving without watter. Sounds ridiculous.   


Hypernatremia makes more sense. If we don't drink water, we lose water content while our sodium stays relatively the same (we lose some through sweat, but sweat is quite low in sodium and we would lose more water than sodium anyways).

ejqk8a|2020-01-04 02:59:57|Is elastic collision only possible for perfectly rigid bodies?|"My thinking was that during a typical collision between non-rigid objects that occupy some volume, the leading edges remain stuck together and in contact until the information that a collision has occured spreads to the entire object while it deforms and the object returns to its original shape after the information has traveled again from the opposite ends of each object to the colliding edges that the objects have finished exchanging momentum. During that entire timeframe, the objects are stuck together as the information travels and the objects deform. 

With that in mind though, I was thinking that maybe the time where the objects are stuck together is avoided in perfectly rigid objects where the entire body instantly reacts to the collision, and thus it's an elastic collision."|_Sunny--|False|https://redd.it/ejqk8a|2|0.57|0|9|1|askscience

So I have two cockatiels, one Pearled and one Whiteface. They have completely different colors, but that's just color mutations. If they were to breed (they're both female, but ya know, for the hypothetical), their offspring would be a Pearled or white face cockatiel.

I used to think species meant that two members could breed and produce fertile children, and that if they couldn't do that, they where separate species.  
    
However, Catalina macaws (and as far as I can tell, almost all hybrid macaws) are completely fertile, and can even be hybridized further with other hybrid species.

Objectively speaking, chemoautotrophs don't create energy from sunlight, so they don't *directly* rely on the sun. But according to several sources, this is misleading. I saw that the chemoautotrophs in Lechuguilla, for example, use atmospheric oxygen (derived from sunlight-driven photosynthesis) as an electron acceptor. Indirectly, they're still reliant on the sun's energy.

Are there any cases of chemoautotrophs (or other lifeforms) which have zero reliance on the sun's energy? Perhaps lava tube microbial mats, or the bacteria around deep sea vents? I'm hoping to hear about lifeforms which could survive unaffected if the solar system suddenly went dark, which the Lechuguillan chemotrophs (presumably) could not.

I am not asking how they gather this data. Rather, is the percentage calculated by base pairs, codons, or individual genes? (E.g. Amount of different base pairs divided by the total amount of base pairs)

I’m wondering because this has a potentially significant impact on how the same data is presented.  Lets say humans have 4 genes. 
If we take one normative human and one human with sickle cell anemia (a point mutation) if you calculate by individual genes their dna is 25% different. If you do it by base pairs they are virtually exactly the same.

I would assume that it is by codons, and I know that this seems relatively trivial and unimportant but the answer will change how I view these statistics.

The Teton Range, which borders Yellowstone, started rising up from the plain some 9 million years ago. The Tetons are full of sea fossils and petrified wood. One boulder field in particular (which sits at at about 10,000 feet elevation) has thousands of visible fossils that are from the Cambrian period, which would have been deposited on the ocean floor some 2.5 billion years ago. ***My question is this: if the Tetons began their appearance 9 million years ago, and those fossils started at the bottom and were then forever on the top of the Teton Range, why were all of these fossils not covered by lava and ash during Yellowstone's last eruption?

ehf9qu|2019-12-30 01:53:29|How are commercial scale cooked products made safe to store?|"So it's pretty common knowledge that if you cook something like chicken, and leave it out on the bench at room temperature for a day or two, it may be dangerous to eat. If you refridgerate it, it's good for a few days, and if you freeze it, it can be good for a while.

I understand this is because dangerous bacteria live and breed in certain temperatures (I was always told 5-60c), and if you ingest a large enough mass of those bacteria, they'll mess you up?

I've read online that if you cook something yourself and freeze it, it'll stay good for up to 6 months. But if you go out and buy a frozen dinner from the supermarket, it usually has a use by date a year or two into the future.

The last few years the supermarkets around me have started to stock 'fresh' refridgerated meals, that don't come frozen. If I cook a curry or something and put it in the fridge, it can start to go bad after 4-5 days, but most of these supermarket meals have use by dates into the weeks, sometimes as high as 3 weeks.

Even more recently (like last month or so), I've started to see completely unrefridgerated versions of these meals. Things like chicken curries that have a use by date of 6 months (!!!).

So my question is, what technology do companies use to achieve these gains in the food storage space?

Assuming of course that a subspecies is, as defined, a ""a taxonomic category that ranks below species, usually a fairly permanent geographically isolated race""

((( Is it possible for the human race to be divided into taxonomical subspecies? )))

I know the human race is divided along many superficial physiological borders, between black and white and orthognathy and prognathy, etc., and that these features have little isolated bearing, as oftentimes they can appear in populations quite distant to one another; often to the dismay of phenotypists. However, there are many features unique to what used to be highly isolated populations. 

For example, the people who historically populated and continue to populate the Himalayas are known to have larger hemoglobin than most other cultural isolates, helping them dissolve and absorb oxygen more efficiently at higher altitudes. 

Furthermore, the peoples of Central Africa have a specialized susceptibility to Sickle-Celled Anaemia, which in turn reduces and in some cases even eliminates their risk of contracting malaria from mosquito vectors. 

Even the Germanic people of Northern Europe are in their own way specialized, having the most lactose tolerant individuals per capita in the world, thanks to their naturally developed capability to produce large quantities of the enzyme lactase. 

These populations standing as examples, I believe it is possible to divide the archaic cultural isolates (prior to today's heavily interconnected society) into human taxonomical subspecies, and I wanted to see the reddit science communities opinion on whether this was viable or not.

**Edit:**

Thank you to everyone who answered this! I've seen some of your answers, and maybe I wasn't very clear. Yes, I can remember and imagine pictures, places and random things. It's just that for music, it's WAY easier to ""replay"" it on my mind. With pictures, it's a little bit more difficult. I do not have aphantasia.

Some of you have pointed out that this varies from person to person.  It made sense to me that it was a common behavior, but after reading your comments and thinking about it for some time, I saw that my initial thought was erroneous. Thanks for pointing that out.

Also, some of you pointed out that it's easier to ""replay"" music in our head for evolutionary reasons.  As our eyes are always occupied with seeing things, if we could just imagine a vivid lion in front of us, it would be a disaster.  That is something that I've never thought about, and makes a lot of sense.

And, some of you also said that it's related to repetition. If I'm listening to a song over and over, my brain will remember it perfectly after some repetitions. 

So, after reading your answers, I've come to the understanding that this happens because of a series of factors that when combined, will favor my hearing memory instead of my visual memory. And that this is not true for everyone - some may have a better visual memory, and some may not even be able to imagine things at all.

People who are lactose intolerant often use lactase pills when having dairy (taken a few minutes before the dairy) to manage the intolerance.  However, it has been reported that (for those who also have GERD), if they take a Pepcid (famotidine) prior to a dairy meal - even though they use lactase pills, they end up suffering as if they never took any lactase at all.

Originally, I thought this was because the Pepcid was slowing down the digestion, so the lactase wasn't hanging around long enough to be effective.  However, doing some research led me to discover that Pepcid doesn't delay the gastric emptying rate (1).  

That being the case, can someone with a better knowledge of biology explain to me why Pepcid causes this effect?

eev45l|2019-12-24 03:00:48|What is the smallest known object that still occupies space?|"So my understanding is that, according to the standard model, the fundamental particles are all point particles that occupy no space (or atleast, it is meaningless to talk about them having a size).

But if I wanted to identify a ""physical object"" (I know that gets a bit fuzzy at these scales) that occupies some physical space, it must be some form of hadron, no?  From looking online, it appears protons have a diameter of roughly 1e-15m, but is there anything smaller than that?  I thought at first mesons might be, as they are composed  of only two fundamental particles, but Wikipedia says that they are actually larger than protons.  That leads me to believe that maybe more quarks lead to smaller objects, but that now gets in a territory that I know absolutely nothing about.

So, is there a widely accepted ""smallest"" thing?  Something that still has an accepted or measured (or even predicted size) that *isn't* a concept like the Planck length."|ChrisGnam|False|https://redd.it/eev45l|4074|0.92|0|379|1|askscience

This, so I am told, is due to it being a polar covalent molecular solid. Fair enough.

What I don't understand then is why Diamond is even more slippery, when it is a monatomic non-molecular, non-covalent crystalline solid.

It can't be simply smoothness. Optical quality glass isn't remotely slippery, yet rough, sharp, opaque ice created from freezing rain is still slippery even against other ice. Why is rough ice slippery, diamond slippery, but glass not?

And how about dry ice? It's not nearly as slippery as water ice as long as the thing touching it is also cold.

What about metals? Aluminium (with the oxide layer) isn't slippery. Nor is gold, steel, copper, Zinc, Lead, Alkali metals, etc.

So what makes ice and diamond slippery and other smooth, solid surfaces not? Is there some kind of rule for what materials will be slippery?"|pds314|False|https://redd.it/eejlzn|3114|0.92|0|371|1|askscience

But a neutron is more massive than a proton so deuterium is more massive than two protons which means that we end up with more mass than we started with.

ecg5g4|2019-12-18 18:05:39|Why doesn't Deuterium spontaneously form from most Hydrogen neutron collisions?|As I understand it, in nuclear rectors, Uranium releases neutrons which collide with water molecules to slow down. Since there are a bunch of neutrons bouncing around, presumably some are colliding with some hydrogens in H2O. The binding energy of Deuterium is \~2MeV, and neutrons start out at around \~2MeV but slow down to much less than that, so it doesn't make sense to me that the neutrons are going too fast to make the reaction favorable.  There shouldn't be any repulsive force when the neutron gets close to a proton and they should actually attract each other when they are close enough for the strong force to be in effect. So why don't these collisions result in deuterium production?|titouan00|False|https://redd.it/ecg5g4|4|0.71|0|6|1|askscience

Not sure if this is possible but do y’all know how to extract or make calcium oxide from green mussel shells? We need it for our research but we've tried different methods and none have worked so far.

So we first tried putting the shells over an open flame from a gas stove. We placed them on top of a grill so we wouldn't have to hold them. What we got was a burnt shell that was very brittle and didn't look like calcium oxide. We also tried using a blowtorch on the shells for like, a direct contact with the flames or smth. The same thing happened, burnt mussel shells that are brittle. We planned to use calcium oxide as a water filter but every attempt we've tried so far has failed. Still can't think of an answer as to why it happened and how we can avoid it.

We've looked at past research papers for tips and they always included ""The dried waste shells were calcined at 700–1,000°C in air atmosphere with a heating rate of 10°C/min for 4 h "" and we can't understand what it means. We tried placing them outside so they get caught in the sun's heat but nothing has happened. Maybe you guys know what calcined in air atmosphere means?

This is a video that gives the same explanation. Mind you, it's not the only one. Every video/article online that attempts to explain the Coriolis force uses the same logic. I have even had professional lectures on universities where they attribute the Coriolis force on the relative difference of linear velocities.

My question is simple: Is this explanation correct? From my experience and knowledge, it's not. The Coriolis force has nothing to do with initial linear velocities that are preserved due to inertia. It's a purely fictitious force that is a result of different observations from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference  
In fact the explanation of the above video, can't explain why there is still Coriolis force when the object moves on the meridional direction, e.g. when it moves along a constant latitude.

A little digging around about vision loss in space showed theories that it could be down to increased levels of cerebrospinal fluid causing intracranial pressure. I thought it might be something to do with blood pressure, though the measurements of astronauts' blood pressure when returning from the ISS varied greatly; some astronauts had low blood pressure but high levels of CSF.

I stumbled upon this because I learned/tried to learn new European languages.
My first theory was, that it’s because they all developed from the Indo-European language family.
But then I looked into the irregular verbs in Japanese. And their only irregular verbs are “to come” and “to do”!

eaw36z|2019-12-15 07:28:36|Does a stronger shockwave neccessarily mean a louder soundwave?|"I'm very confused on how sound and shockwaves work.  Does a shockwave just define any bubble of pressurized air moving faster than sound, or does it have to be produced by a source of sound making waves exceeding 198 db?

I've seen old black and white footage of desert nuclear tests and while the bombs generally sounded like a chorus of shotguns when the blast arrived, the soldiers sure didn't seem to be instantly deafened and then subjected to a fatal embolism like a sailor a couple miles from krakatoa or a diver next to a singing blue whale would be.

So if a shockwave doesn't have to be in excess of 198 db to form and just defines a fluid matter moving faster than its own speed of sound as a medium, then why are the soldiers in nuclear tests not swatted down and tossed back when the shockwave hits, since the speed of sound at sea level is 344 meters per second, while the winds of a category 1 tornado are a measly 32-50 meters per second?"|mynameishweuw|False|https://redd.it/eaw36z|4|0.7|0|9|1|askscience
