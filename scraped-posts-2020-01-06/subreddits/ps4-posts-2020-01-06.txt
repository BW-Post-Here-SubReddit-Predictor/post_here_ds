ekb3vr|2020-01-05 09:55:27|[Meta] /r/PS4 is looking for new moderators - We want to expand the mod team to prepare the subreddit for the changes to come in 2020!|"Happy New Year, **/r/PS4**!  
  
We're saying goodbye to 2019 and are taking a proud look back:  
This community grew from **1,480,000** subscribers to **2,853,000** in 2019. We had a lot of memorable moments during this year, like [the release of an old fan favorite](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/c3alvz/my_first_post_on_reddit_nearly_six_years_ago_my/), the [announcements](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/d8su7c/video_the_last_of_us_part_ii_release_date_reveal/) of [release dates](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/bugg5n/video_death_stranding_release_date_reveal_trailer/) for [highly anticipated games](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/byomyy/video_cyberpunk_2077_official_e3_2019_cinematic/), the sixth [birthday](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/dwuito/happy_6th_birthday_to_the_ps4_whatre_your/) of our favorite console, and, of course, the first official glimpse at its [successor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/bdt78e/exclusive_what_to_expect_from_sonys_nextgen/)  
  
But it's 2020 now and we're facing the future and the launch of the PS5, which will happen in less then one year.  
  
Seeing how us moderators are planning to slowly transition discussion and content regarding the PlayStation 5 over to our sister sub, /r/PS5, we will be amending some of this sub's rules and guidelines, of which we will inform the community in due time.  
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
However, we would like to add some extra help for this. One of our moderators, /u/JebusOfEagles, quit modding this sub recently due to unrelated reasons. If you are reading this, you are missed by the whole team! ^also ^you ^still ^owe ^me ^5 ^bucks.  
  
To fill the hole they left, we want to hire YOU! We are looking to take on 2-4 new active moderators in the following weeks, and would like everybody interested apply via a comment in this thread.  
  
#Requirements:  
  
* Ability and willingness to communicate with the team via modmail and the third-party messenger app ""Slack"". 
  
* Ability to stick with it and not lose interest after a couple months.  
  

#Application process:  
  
Include the following info in your application as a reply to this post:
  
  
* Are you well versed in the rules of /r/PS4? Please include a link to the rules along with this answer.
  
* How long have you been an /r/PS4 subscriber?  
  
* What is your comment/link karma for /r/PS4? Overall?  
  
* Why do you want to do this?  
  
* Would you keep doing this for year(s) down the road, even when the PS4 has become a last-gen console? Why?  
  
* Do you play a lot of different games? What games don't you like?
  
* How much time a week could you volunteer to this? In which time zone of the world are you located?  
  
* What's a modqueue?

el0stc|2020-01-06 21:38:57|I'm a teacher starting a Gaming Club at my high school, I need help understanding PS4s lol|"Hey guys,

I am a 9th grade teacher at an inner city school. The kids all love Fortnite, COD, Apex, etc. A lot of them can only play at friends houses bc they don't have internet at home. I got approval to start a gaming club, I think it will really encourage better attendance and grades as I'm going to declare a minimum GPA to stay in the club too. My students are SUPER excited about it. The school is giving me a stipend of about  $900 for the extra hours I'll work with the club. That is intended to be extra salary for me, but I want to use the $900 to get a couple refurbished PS4s and monitors from Craigslist or something for the kids to play on since the ""computer lab"" at school is from about 2003 and could NEVER run the games in question. However, I told my husband this and he said that they still couldn't play without paying a monthly or yearly fee to access the PS4 network. I just spent a lot of time on the PS4 website but am still lost, was hoping someone here could provide clarity:

1. Could I pay for 1 membership per PS4, and kids could sign into their individual Apex / Fortnite accounts on it, or would they each need their own paid PS4 membership for that?
2. If I do need a separate membership per player, could I have multiple ps4 accounts using the same PS4? For example, if there are 10 kids in the club but I only have 1 console, could all 10 kids theoretically use the same PS4 by signing into their own network account when it was their turn to play? It looked like there might be a 4 account limit, but I wasn't sure if that was referring to some sort of simultaneous 4-person gameplay.

Thank you in advance for any help or advice.

&#x200B;

ekuobn|2020-01-06 14:15:44|PSA: When you clean out your PS4, watch the thickness of the thermal pads.|"I cleaned out a used/for parts PS4 I bought. I got lucky, only thing wrong was the hard drive.  Disassembly was easy and I used 1mm thermal pads on both front and back on the ram chips and Artic Silver 5 for the APU.  As soon as I started up FF XV the fan ripped up like a jet engine, and I even got a warning.  I couldn't figure out what I did and opened up and reapplied the paste.  Same thing.  Turns out my thermal pads were too thick.  I can't find out much online except an old post that says the pads are .8mm on one side and can go to 1mm on the other.

I couldn't find .8mm pads on amazon so I went with .5mm and it runs like a dream. Quiet and cool.  The pads were so thick before I believe they were effecting the APU's contact with its heatsink.  I have a CUH-1001A model so yours might be different. Just thought I'd drop this to help the next person restoring a PS4!"|BlueRogue11|False|https://redd.it/ekuobn|24|0.67|0|6|1|ps4

I do have a few gripes though. Currently playing on a PS4 slim. Didn't see much mention of them on this sub so I thought people might want to know before buying:

* The framerate will sometimes drop really really low during combat. I'm talking like below 15fps
* The load times can get pretty long, and it feel  punishing when you die. Especially early in the game where I kept dying a lot before I really got into the groove of combat
* There is a lot of texture pop-in, most notably on signs and posters. I'll be staring at a blurry sign right up against it and it won't load for around 2 seconds.

Despite all this I still recommend anyone to pick up this game. I can't stress it enough: the combat feel is AMAZING once you get your first few powers. This is the SCP Foundation game I've been waiting for."|Ebolamonkey|False|https://redd.it/ekz7is|0|0.54|0|4|1|ps4

Posted this on r/xboxone too. Someone suggested I post here too to get answers from both forums.

As stated in the title I own both PS4 pro and Xbox one X. PS4 has been my main this generation. I just recently bought my one X. Now I can’t decide which console I should buy my multi-plat games on. Games like Doom Eternal and Cyberpunk for instance.

PS4 Pro 

+I have a great library already so it feels good keep most games in one place
+ PS5 will have BC with PS4
+ I love ps exclusives and will definitely buy a PS5

Xbox One X
+ better performance this generation
+ good history of BC with improvements. So games I buy now might perform better in the future.
+ Rumored to be more powerful than PS5 so Series X might be better for multi-plat.

eku6t9|2020-01-06 13:32:41|YouTube app seemingly being censored?|"I watch a bunch of YouTube on my PS4 and I've noticed over the last few weeks of use some channels seem to be censored somehow. The only ones that spring to mind right now are ""That Chapter"" and ""Darkside Royalty Lore"" and it appears to happen a second or two before and after something like ""fuck"" or ""shit"" is said. I've even gone so far as to verify by checking in the YouTube app on my phone and the audio gap doesn't happen on it. The bizarre part though is that there are other instances in the same video of one of those same words being said without being censored.

When I say it's being censored, I just mean that the audio cuts out momentarily without any reason as far as why. It's really odd and kind of irritating because I don't have any parental controls set for my Google account, let alone my YouTube account.

ekbdrj|2020-01-05 10:27:36|I just beat Rage 2. A missed chance really. Could have been much better.|"So I just finished Rage 2. When the first Rage game came out I had high expectations and although I ended up enjoying the game, to me it was always a missed chance. With Rage 2 my expectations were not high but I still wanted to give the game a go and it was a mediocre experience at best.

I must say that the graphics are excellent and the gameplay is quite fun and I had no performance issues on my PS4 Pro. The thing that made me mad was how pointless the entire game was. The story was worse than a generic story. If you don't focus on side missions or exploration then the game itself is extremely short and extremely repetitive. At first I greatly enjoyed playing the game but as days passed by I found myself less interested in playing it. I thought I would go out and explore every bit of the map like how I do in open world games but there was just nothing interesting to keep me playing. If I was a trophy hunter than going for 100% could be fun but I am no longer hunting for trophies and did not care much about the rest of the map to be honest.

Shame because the gunfight is extremely satisfying in the game and the weapons are great but if there is no story to it or at least reasons to explore the map, than everything else becomes pointless. I am glad that I bought the game on the December sale for like 70% off or something as I would really hate to play full price for this game. I really had hoped that this game would be Mad Max in Rage Universe but it turns out to be a cheap version of it. Mad Max was a great game btw.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Great graphics and gameplay. Terrible story and boring open world. A solid 3 out of 5. Enjoyable for a few hours."|iardas|False|https://redd.it/ekbdrj|70|0.82|0|59|1|ps4

This is what sends the signal to the rest of the parts. all of them matter don't get me wrong, but IF you do accidently smooth them out, all you need to do is find a small sewing needle, and a pair of tweezers and remake the indentions.. in the exact same place that they were in. then it should be okay... cleaning also will help with some drift problems tho.

PLEASE HELP|for about 2 weeks now, my ps4 pro has been freezing and crashing constantly on games like rdr2, skyrim and fallout 4. yesterday it started freezing so bad in the start menu that my ps4 turned off and was unresponsive for 10-15 minutes. now it keeps launching into safe mode and telling me that it is checking on the storage status, that kept freezing as well. today i decided i needed to get this fixed so, i went into safe mode, ive attempted to rebuild the database multiple times but when the ps4 tried to go through with it, it shuts down instantly then turns back on and goes straight back to the checking storage status screen after getting sick of trying that, i decided to turn on my pc and download the update file for 7.02, created PS4/UPDATE/PS4UPDATE.PUP on my usb, reformatted it to fat32 and slid it into my ps4, launched into safe mode, and initiated option 3, after it “apparently” installed, it went straight back to the checking storage status page, not even a minute into that and it finished, filled with excitement i was, i waited for it to launch itself back up to the home screen, as the ps4 launched it went straight back to safe mode and initiated the storage status page, my disappointment had gotten the best of me, all i could think of now was trying option 7, factory resetting the whole ps4. while thinking about the situation i was in i remembered that on numbered 3 of safe mode, one of the options were to try install 7.02 through the internet i decided to try that but once more nothing happened and it went right back to safe mode. at this point all i could think of was trying option 7, factory resetting the whole ps4 pro a long think went into this and i decided to give it a try, it took 10 minutes for it to restore, after about 2 minutes of a black screen the start up for ps4 finally initiated. i did all the start up settings and made a test user just to make sure everything was okay, i didn’t even connect to the internet. this time i was curious to see that my ps4 couldn’t even handle going into the settings to see what system software version i was on!!!! i restarted the ps4 and tried again but when it was loading into the software version page my ps4 completely crashed and won’t even respond to my controllers plugged in. what the flipping hell is going on?|Alcwoholic|False|https://redd.it/eku7ch|0|0.31|0|9|1|ps4

ekrbew|2020-01-06 08:35:41|Anyway to give away my PS4, PS4 account and all it's games to my brother?|"I want to give away my PS4 to my brother. I had originally bought it to play its exclusives and until I could build my own PC. I've enjoyed playing it, but I no longer have much need for it. My brother would benefit more from it.

I live in Bahrain and he's back in India. My PSN account is region locked to Bahrain. If I were to give my PS4 with the games to him, he'd login with his own account with region set as India. So it would be good if I could transfer my account to his account.

Basically, at the very least if all my games could be transferred to him, it would be for the best.

Edit: Additional info. The email id is only used for this PSN account. I can give him my email and PSN account to use for himself.

But the problem is the region lock on the PSN account. My PSN doesn't have access to games like GTA5 and God of War 3(some of our favourites), but the Indian region does. He could buy the disk and play them(probably) but digital downloads are going to be an issue. 

If I could either, A) Sell all my games, both digital and disks to his own account, or B) Change region of my PSN account.

It was working perfectly fine beforehand and the TV is clearly recognizing it as it gives the HDMI option to switch to for it. It turns on but just glows blue and I can take discs in and out.

Sony and microsoft made games a subscription service. I just find this very anti-consumer. Now yes, i understand that Sony and Microsoft want money. I completely understand. But there is a certain moral line that i don't think a company should pass. Here's an example.

I am a massive racing fan. And what better game for racing than Gran Turismo. I own every GT game on the PS so i understandably bought GT Sport. But now that i have started paying attention to the actions of companies, i got annoyed.

GT Sport, an expensive game that focuses on online racing and that is made by sony requires a service that costs 70€ a year to experience fully. I will not be calling this out as misleading though as the requirement is shown in the store page. But c'mon. I pre ordered the game for 80€ if i remember correctly. I have PS+ so i didn't realize the issue straight away, but i if i didn't have it i would have paid for a product that has its biggest feature locked behind another paywall.

Almost every online game requires PS+. It is ridiculous that i don't get to use the product to it's fullest extent unless i pay another sum of money every month. And i know that Sony wont get rid of it as it makes them a lot of money.

Now sure, the free games and extra discounts are nice and all, but more often than not the games are cheap and don't suit me. I ain't gonna say i dont like some of the free games i got, but most of them i don't. 

I would be fine with this system if the games would be fully usable without PS+. Sure, then to give more incentives to buy the service like more games per month or getting to choose one game every two months.

This error is conveniently undocumented in the Playstation 4 error reference page (https://www.playstation.com/en-za/get-help/#!/error-code/). 


Google is able to produce a whopping 2 pages of results, and less than half of those links are even relevant.
Out of the relevant half of those links, half of those remain unanswered (years later) and the other half are just users recommending the obvious steps.


I have tried all the obvious steps, which includes all 7 of the safe mode options, and I have also tried multiple hard drives and USB drives trying to get this update (or, now, the system software) to install. 


Every single time I get stuck at 0% on the System Software Update screen, followed by a full minute of nothing happening, then the SU-30676-2 error code presenting.


The Playstation says it will restart and try again, but it does not restart. It turns off, then when I go to turn it back on, it will beep once with no light on the console. I am unable to get a response from the power button after this beep. This lasts about 5 seconds, then the power button behaves normally as if the PS4 is starting from ""powered off"" mode.


I sent this console in two years ago to have a similar issue addressed.. paid the infamous $99 service charge and it has worked with minimal issues up until this latest update.


Am I expected to have this console serviced every two years? If so, I will not be interested in Sony's next release.


Any insight is appreciated.

**Is it possible to buy games from multiple country stores, but have them readily available to play for both gamer profiles?** If so, how would I set that up?

ekkllv|2020-01-05 23:03:24|PS4 (CUH-1001A) still overheating after trying everything, plz help|"Hi all, I have an old PS4 CUH-1001A. I got it from a friend four years ago. It's always been a LOUD PS4, and occasionally overheats in the summer time or when the room is too warm. I've always just dealt with this by playing in the basement because I haven't been able to fix it, but I recently moved and I just cannot make it work anywhere in my new residence.

THE PROBLEM: When playing most games, especially higher-end games, the PS4 fan is incredibly loud, far louder than any console or computer I've ever owned. Often, it will give me a blue screen message ""PS4 too hot"", along with the power light flashing red, and will power itself off if I don't exit whatever game I'm playing. The PS4 won't work at all in a warm room; I can't play a game like Resident Evil 2 remake or The Witcher 3 for even 5 minutes before I get told that it's too hot. The bottom of the PS4 actually does get quite warm to the touch.

WHAT I HAVE TRIED: I have blown all the dust out of the case, fan, and heat sink many times over the past few years. I've dismantled it from top to bottom, and re-applied thermal paste three times over the years. I've also tried all manner of cooling stands and such solutions; nothing works.

WHAT I WILL TRY NEXT: I am going to order a replacement fan. If that doesn't work I will try a replacement power supply, on the off chance that this will fix the issue. Before I do this, does anybody have any ideas? Anything at all?

When I google this problem all I see is a million posts saying either to clean out the dust or to change the thermal paste.

Thanks to anyone who knows anything about this problem.

edit: I guess I should add, I have built computers before and I know how to apply thermal paste, so it's not that."|alkaseltzerthrowaway|False|https://redd.it/ekkllv|0|0.56|0|11|1|ps4

To preface this, I'm a female.
I joined a group last week on the PS4 version of Overwatch with friends named something along the lines of ""buying nudes $150 add my sc 'x'"". We came in just to bother the guy and mess around but before we even got the chance to, he kicked all my friends and just kept me in the group, harassing me to send him nudes and threatening me in multiple ways, including DOXing me and DoS'ing me, which he did. He has been sending me friend requests (and almost immediately after canceling them) harassing me, telling me where I live, and has been forcing me off overwatch mid game at random points over the past two weeks. I already called my ISP and had them change my IP, and haven't responded to any of his messages contained in the requests or given him any sort of gratification. I don't know what to do or how he is still doing this. I removed almost all of my friends I dont actually know or havent spoken to in a few weeks because apparently he had me added on one of his ""smurfs"" too. I could really use some help figuring out what the next step here is.

I also live in Canada and he is clearly from the USA based off of his voice (from the initial time I joined his public group on OW) so I am not sure how the police would handle this even though I know what he's doing is considered illegal. 

This is very stressful and I just want to play like usual again. Thank you for any advice or help you can offer.

TL;DR: Getting DoS'd specifically on Overwatch even though I've changed my IP multiple times. Need help figuring out how to prevent some guy from doing this over and over again."|bpdoomed|False|https://redd.it/ekqgc9|0|0.4|0|22|1|ps4

ekic1q|2020-01-05 20:11:40|PS4 Extended Storage Problem: Does just plugging it into a PC wipe it?|"So basically I've been using a 2Tb Western Digital My Passport external hard drive on my PS4 for about two years. I had about 600 gb worth of games on it. I know that it's formatted to PS4 and can't be used on a PC, so it has a note on it, ""SlickSerpent's Hard Drive, DO NOT USE"" so my parents wouldn't try using it on a PC. 

For two years it hasn't been plugged into a PC and has worked fine. Since I'm off at University now I'm thinking there's no need to worry about my extended storage being accidentally formatted to PC and losing the PS4 data on it. I come home for the Christmas break, and everything PS4 wise is great.

Until today. Or last night, when my Dad was looking for a hard drive and he and my older brother took mine out of my room from it's spot next to my PS4 when I was not present because it looked like his that he uses for music on his computer and and he couldn't find his. Ignoring the explicit DO NOT USE note, they plugged it into a PC. okay ima try and avoid ranting about my brother and Dad but come on read the fucking note.

I found out this morning when I couldn't find my PS4 extended storage, I call my dad, he says they used it on a PC. I shout NO repeatedly but he says it's alright because they didn't reformat it. Okay, it should be fine.

**And yet when I plug it into my PS4, instead of getting the flashing storage icon in the top right and being able to play the games on it, it gives me the notification: ""You can use this USB device as extended storage"" or some shit like that. Sure enough, when I go to storage, the extended storage is not there. And the games are unplayable, they say ""hook up the extended storage device this application is installed on. Going to the notification proves that I have to reformat it. My hard drive is no longer formatted to PS4.**

I get super pissed at my dad and brother, knowing that it's about 1000 hours of gameplay I've lost. 

**But my Dad and brother maintain that they only plugged it into a PC, saw that it was not a compatible format, and unplugged it. They insist that they did not press the option to format it to PC.**

And yet, when I plug it into my PS4, it no longer recognizes it. So, does anyone know, does just plugging a PS4 extended storage into a PC immediately format it to PC and wipe it? Or are my dad and brother lying and they actually did mess it up somehow and reformat it? Any advice on if the game data on my PS4 extended storage is recoverable would be greatly appreciated."|SlickSerpent|False|https://redd.it/ekic1q|1|0.6|0|6|1|ps4

ekhmto|2020-01-05 19:23:05|Best ps4 headset|"Hey everyone! 
I have been doing some research but really haven't come to a conclusion; what is the best headset to use with ps4? I loved the psn silver headsets but they degraded pretty quickly. I've had cloud hyperx and those were trash (they muted themselves because of some weird interaction with the circuit board in the wire buttons). And now I am using logitech pro series, but the cord for them keeps moving in a way that it changes the sound and affects gameplay. 
These are ultimately what I am looking for in a headset with gaming:

Wired or wireless (depends on battery life for wireless really)

A large range of volume control (better control party chat and in game volumes)

Loud enough to actually here the game

A high Hertz range to better identify footsteps from further away

Noise cancelling (to avoid questions that my wife asks)

Good comms. Abilities to talk with my friends.

And hopefully not too expensive.



Let me know your opinions and I appreciate any responses I get!

Well I cant get away with playing on a controller,  that would be noticed (specially with how iconic and weirdly let up the ps4 pad is) 

So all I need to do is emulate a ps4 control pad with mouse and keyboard....link left analog to wasd link right analog to the mouse and map keyboard to the other buttons..... sounds so simple... yet I have mo idea how to do it.

I tried using applications like virtual joypad but no idea what I am doing, searches show years old posts with info that doesnt link or makes no sense....or worse, just end with ""solved thanks""....how?! 

So ummm yeah....how do I do this (ideally with free software, we guards arnt paid much)


Possible solution*
Ok I have a solution for my situation, https://grill2010.github.io/psJoy.html allows you to use https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grill.shockpad&hl=en_GB on your phone to control remoteplay on your laptop. 

I have it all set up and working though remote play can not connect to my ps4 via the internet...an issue with remote play and not the apps.

Shockpad is advert supported (though given the option to remove the ads is a couple of quid I will do that on pay day after testing it for a day or two)

*I say possible as I can not turn on my ps4 remotely to set it up (ps remoteplay is having issues seeing it through my router) alas my cat is refusing to answer the phone so will have to wait till i get home to set it up. 

will update this post when I have tested fully.... however, the ps remote app on pc asks you to press options to start searching and that works via the app on the phone....it also auto hits ps button and pairs to the app so I see no reason it wont work once I get remoteplay and my playstation talking to each other"|mrgreaper|False|https://redd.it/ekfcd0|2|0.53|0|7|1|ps4

I can not decide between 3 headsets, being the Philips SHP9500 (with V-Moda BoomPro), the Hyperx Cloud Alpha and the Logitech G Pro. All three being under €100. (SHP9500 & Cloud Alpha +-€95, G Pro +-€80).

I have been reading a lot of positive things about the Philips SHP9500 in combination with the V-Moda BoomPro. Some reviewers are even saying they are the best (gaming) headphones of all time. But I am a bit unsure about the bass response. Some say the bass is a bit lacking for gaming, which the main purpose of the headset will be. I play mostly story-driven singleplayer games and occasionally competitive shooters online with friends. So the bass helps the immersiveness in those singleplayer games.

That is why I am also thinking about buying the HyperX Cloud Alpha or the Logitech G Pro instead because they are closed-back and reviews say they have overall good sound with good bass response but probably not as good as the SHP9500.

Any help would be appreciated

Dinosaurs aren't those reptilian leathery things, they are related to birds and shit. It'd make a cute little change, while also keeping the dinosaurs authentic, plus it would just be nice to have some changes in design in general.

&#x200B;

Also have one of the unlocks or something be where giant chickens chase you around and stuff ;)

&#x200B;

Idk, just feel like it was a cool idea to have realistic dinosaurs in how we view them nowadays to demonstrate the variance between how we viewed dinos then and now."|HopOnTheHype|False|https://redd.it/eklgtr|0|0.39|0|7|1|ps4

So I'd like to download games to my PS4 on the fast Internet, then somehow bring a copy of that download to the slow Internet PS4 to install it there without having to download it again.

As far as I can tell this is impossible. The closest you can come is to *move* the game from the PS4 to an external hard drive, which deletes it from the original PS4. Then you can *move* the game again from the external drive to the second PS4, which deletes it from the external drive. Nowhere are you allowed to copy, only move. That's what I'm doing now, and I just download it a second time on the PS4 with fast Internet.

That seems awfully dumb. Is there some reason Sony doesn't just allow you to copy? It's not a piracy thing; the game is locked to my account, I'm not breaking whatever basic copy protection Sony has. I just want to make a copy of the game to a second device that has a license to use it.

So far I've tried unplugging the system and plugging it back in, rebuilding the database, and reinitializing (Option 7 Safe Mode). Despite all of that the system still ends up freezing and hanging.

At this point I'm assuming something has gone wrong with the hard drive. My only questions are is it normal for there to be significant performance drop while downloading files, and are these issues something I can fix on my own by ordering a new hard drive and replacing it, or formatting it from a PC, or should I send it in for repairs?

Does exactly what I wanted - switches automatically and right away just by flipping the power on/off on the headset itself - no need to change any settings or unplug the dongle.
I did have to use a USB extension cord to minimize WiFi interference, though (luckily I still had [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008KDMI4K/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_ywEeEbJVMQMN2) that I wasn't using that came with my PC mouse). I have that extension plugged into a USB port hub that is plugged into my PS4. Still works fine. Plus they are much more comfortable than my Stealth 450s. Definitely recommend.
They also [work with my Nintendo Switch](https://www.imore.com/these-are-wireless-headsets-work-nintendo-switch) using the dongle in the dock.

ORIGINAL POST:

I currently have some Turtle Beach Stealth 450s, and they work great, but even when I turn them off (using the button on the headset itself), the PS4 still tries to push the audio to them unless I *manually* switch it in the PS4's settings, or get up and unplug the dongle entirely.

I'm trying to find a pair to replace them, that allows me to leave the dongle connected ALL THE TIME, and trigger the PS4's ""automatic switching"" just by turning the headset on or off, with no further action required.

Is this possible?

Preferably a pair that I can also use with my docked Nintendo Switch as well (by moving the dongle over on the rare occasions that I want to do that).

ek5pkg|2020-01-05 01:12:27|The misuse of quick time events.|"I've never been a big fan of QTE's. Always thought they were a cheap play feature. You have no introduction to them and usually will die once or twice in a game due to them being thrown up at you out of the blue and you spend the first time or two just seeing what you had to do.

But I understand why some devs use them. Disagree but see what they were trying. 

I just did a big action scene in Spider Man to do with an escapgin helicopter that I had to stop from trashing the city. I had to keep watching for qte's. The devs obviously put these here to keep the flow of the cinematic cut scen in place. 

The big problem is, i didn't get to experience it. I spent my time watching and waiting for another qte to pop up, quickly register what i had to do and then carry it out. The entire cut scene was wasted because rather than enjoy the spectacle i was watching the middle of the screen for prompts.

I remember playing RE\^ and the amount of qte that did the exact same thing really took away from the game. Add into the fact that qte's don't utilise any skill or techniques that you've learned in the main play style and it adds to their pointlessness. 

It'd be easy to say that we need them for big cut scenes and yes they can have a place, one of the battles in God of War (won't say which) invloves some combat and minor qte's that balance perfetcly and add to the cinematic event you are involved in.

The PlayStation store refund policy says you can’t get a refund after the content is downloaded unless it’s faulty. 

Here’s the story.. 

I bought this game called Ticket to Ride made by Asmodee Digital. It’s based on a board game and it uses PlayStation playlink so that multiple people can play at the same time. The playlink part of it is an iOS/Android app that you download separately (it’s free) and it interfaces with the game. You must use the app to play the game. So I get the iOS app and it’s not been updated for iPhone X screens. Everything in the app is cut off... it’s unusable. Which means the game is unusable. There are multiple comments from iOS customers on the App Store page complaining about the issue which the developer acknowledges, responds to and says they will fix... but that was months and months ago. 

I tried to get a refund today from the PlayStation Store web chat agent which was a dead end. When I pointed out that the game was faulty she said that they didn’t have reports from the developer about any issues. 

Im going to call on Monday and try again. Maybe I can point out that the developer has acknowledged this problem in the App Store but hasn’t fixed it.

ejyx9i|2020-01-04 16:47:05|Duplicate devices / Deactivation|"Hello,

Apologies in advance for a potentially bonehead question.

I recently bought a PS4 Pro for my son as his old PS4 was beginning to cack.  When I log onto the PSN via browser, I saw an old PS3 I had forgotten about, and two devices with no name.  I labelled the last as PS4 Pro, but BOTH the blanks ones changed to PS4 Pro  (screenshot).  Any change I make to either label impacts both.

With the **old PS4**, I have **deactivated** it as the primary AND **initialized**.  It's now as it was from the factory.

With the **NEW PS4 Pro**, I have **activated** it as primary and everything is working perfectly.

Both the old PS4 and new PS4 Pro have myself as the family manager, and my son as a family member.

Question:

1. How do I deactivate the PS3 (long since discarded) from PSN (browser view)?
2. How do I deactivate the PS4 (I still physically have it) from PSN (browser view)?
3. What happens if I select \[Deactivate All Devices\] from the PSN browser view? (screenshot)

End result should be only seeing one device on the web view of PSN. No?

I feel like this shouldn't be as complicated as it is.

Its actually one of the oldest games released on PS4, I think when PS4 first came out. But its a very solid game, I enjoy the murder mystery games like this.. its not easy to get hold of it now.. can't buy it on Playstation store, you have to buy it physical disc.

My sadness with next gen consoles is the lack of murder mystery games, back on PS3 and XBOX 360 there were tons of them, but now there is not many at all.. only a few, its a shame, I enjoy them and finding all the clues. The puzzles are challenging and interesting.. great games.

I also have played Sherlock Holmes and the Devils Daughter, thats also amazing and give it 10/10. I really enjoy these type of murder mystery games, I think they are underrated.. ABC Murders is another on PS4, but thats about it.. there is not many more.. only a few PS3 ports.  Its a big shame and a HUGE gap in the market.. there are many gamers like myself that really enjoy the riddles and clue solving and actually using your brain, instead of shooting everything and going crazy.

 I hope when PS5 comes out that there will be murder mystery games on them, there has been very slim pickings on PS4 and XBOX One. Shame really.. they are very good games.  There was a lot more on PS3."|Crash_Team_Racing_Go|False|https://redd.it/ejgfqz|31|0.68|0|63|1|ps4

ek3f29|2020-01-04 22:14:07|Explain to a noob like me why powerful next gen consoles can't do backwards compatibility, when old weak consoles could easily...|"So as we all know PS4 can't play any PS1, PS2 or PS3 discs, none work... and XBOX One can play a few XBOX 360 games but 90% don't work at all, I have tried tons and most do not work, example I just tried Nat Geo Quiz Wildlife XBOX 360 Disc on XBOX One and it doesn't work.

But wait??? why is it so complicated, I keep hearing all this talk that it is ""so hard and difficult"" to do backwards compatibility,  even though the consoles are supposed to be much more powerful and can do much much much more, yet old consoles with supposed limited capabilities can do backwards compatibility with total ease. 

For example:

PS2 can play PS1 Discs

PS3 can play PS1 and PS2 Discs

Wii can play Gamecube Discs

Wii U can play Wii Discs

Nintendo 3DS can play all Nintendo DS games

And the list goes on and on and on and on....

Yet new much more powerful consoles can't do it?? they have not enough technology or power to play older games? Hmmm something seems fishy to me, I can't wrap my brain around it,  are they deliberately making everything complicated?, I want some proof as to why they can't play them.  It seems they are deliberately on purpose making everything complicated and trying to push us to their services such as PS Now and Gamepass.  

I am not a technician, I just play games, so please enlighten me and explain to me.. because I am a noob in this field, I don't get it. It makes no sense, I have had it explained before and yet the facts don't add up. I think we maybe being duped on purpose to be pushed to their services. Am I wrong to think backwards compatibility is as easy as pushing a button?, because I need some explaining..  fill me in guys.. I know that you know your stuff, much more than I do.................."|Crash_Team_Racing_Go|False|https://redd.it/ek3f29|0|0.18|0|13|1|ps4

ejy396|2020-01-04 15:41:35|What new features would you like to see in next gen gaming consoles?|"Yesterday I was playing split screen COD Zombies and multiplayer campaigns on my PS4 and thought about the possibility of having a second screen. 

Something like this would be a game changer in my opinion. Not just for split screen play, but for other serious gameplay. 

Think of the possibilities! Playing games online for example: a second screen could allow you to move HUD data, chat and other useful things to your second screen. 

Immediately I think, well this may add a lot of additional load to the GPU, but if done in a way that makes the second screen low frame rate and not a lot of ""action"", I think it could be done. 

Another one is a second stream that can add applets for streamers to manage streams and chat. 

What do you think? And what other features would you like to see in the next gen consoles.

ejtt4i|2020-01-04 07:54:51|How long does it take to charge your DS4 controllers?|"I’m using one of these aftermarket stands to sit two controllers and charge them both off one USB. The charging lights don’t work well and blink between red and blue while charging when they should be steady red while charging and blue when charged. 

My controller has been charging for 9h now but it’s still charging apparently because it has this orange breathing light bar pattern. I put it to charge when it had 1/3 left. 

Should it be taking so long? Can anyone recommend a good charging stand where I just drop the controller on to charge (ie no mini usb to fiddle with)"|TrainingSetting|False|https://redd.it/ejtt4i|0|0.4|0|10|1|ps4
ejzj2f|2020-01-04 17:32:14|So I watched Inception for the first time in about a decade...|"Light spoilers, I guess, but I’m convinced that it would make for an absolutely mind-blowing video game if handled by either Remedy or Naughty Dog. 

As gravity shifted about a twisting hotel, characters floating through it as if through space, I couldn’t help but be reminded of the Ashtray Maze. Control really proved that Remedy has a gift for conducting dreamlike sequences. Then I thought of Uncharted-style shootouts and set pieces when it came to how the action in the movie played out. Not only that, but the heist-style story and fast-talking, morally grey characters are prime for Naughty Dog’s narrative touch. I know chances are slim to none on a movie from a decade ago with no contemporary buzz surrounding it getting a video game adaptation/sequel but uuuuuuuh Neil Druckman, if you can just get started on this, that’d be greeeeaaaaat thanks 🙏🏼"|lo_REZ90|False|https://redd.it/ejzj2f|0|0.39|0|6|1|ps4
