ea9vis|2019-12-13 21:05:43|Annual State of the Sub Post: 'This is not the best Q&A Subreddit'|"It is one of the most well known.  We also aren't what anyone would call 'casual' or 'easy'.

This sub's name is idiomatic and that is often confusing to newer visitors.  I'll make a comment below for anyone who wants to talk about rule 4 or just read about it.

For reasons that include a lot of luck, good timing and good fortune this sub is maybe the best known 'questions' sub.  Certainly among newer users of reddit.

The problem becomes that a lot of people just know us as the popular sub for questions and end up stumbling into a whole heap of hoops to jump through to post.

**The TL:DR of this post is that r/nostupidquestions is the sub that many people are looking for when they come here.  It is a place where no earnest question is against the rules (no question is stupid there).  They have a thriving community and reliably produce timely answers.**

We want people to have a good experience and for a lot of people that might mean they want to visit our spiritual sister-sub.  Both are good and we want to help people find the one that fits them best.

Various other comments below can discuss further.

ekkuax|2020-01-05 23:20:16|ELI5: log(n) = O(n^c)|"I'm pretty sure I understand the basics of orders of complexity, but I just can't understand this one. The context here is trying to explain why `f(n)_1 = n^0.99999 * log(n)` is asymptotically less complex than `f(n)_2 = 1000000 * n`.

This comes from MIT's open courseware algorithms class on the first problem set found [here](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.006/fall11/psets/ps1_solutions.pdf) and the explanation they gave was essentially ""`O(f(n)_1) < O(f(n)_2)` because both are `O(n)`"", which is...just...what?

I did see both [this](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/41588/do-not-understand-why-log-n-onc-for-any-c0) and [this](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/824/sorting-functions-by-asymptotic-growth) in StackExchange but didn't find them particularly helpful.

Edit: Missing parenthesis. Also, to me `O(f(n)_1) = O(n*log(n))`, but this is wrong and I don't get why.

Edit 2: Thanks to u/Wargon2015 for hitting the parts of the equation that my brain was skipping over. I've re-written a shorter explanation that I think captures the gist of it.

`f(n)_1` has a faster computational speed than linear time because of the following:
1. `n^0.999...` is inherently upper bounded by linear time since the exponent is between 0 and 1, meaning the rate of change in the function decays.
2. No matter what the value of `c` is in `O(n^c)`, this will always be an upper bound to `log(n)`.
3. If we happen to substitute `n^c` for `log(n)` so that `n^0.999... * n^c = n`, then we know that anything less than `n^c` _must_ be less than linear.
4. Since we know `log(n) < n^c`, we are able to say because of (3) that `f(n)_1` is also faster than linear time."|Metomorphose|False|https://redd.it/ekkuax|4|0.83|0|8|1|explainlikeimfive
