#UPDATE

**I'm delighted to announce that I was recently appointed to the Communications Advisory Board of the Folding@home initiative: https://foldingathome.org/communication-advisory-board/**

**It's an honor for me to be included in a group with such distinctive individuals, and an awesome opportunity to help this wonderful project grow.**

Please check out the intro video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wypC32o1tPA

My mother passed away from cancer in July 2016, only 30 days after I was told that she had the condition.

Like me, many others have seen family and friends suffer with this plague. It all makes us feel helpless and desperate.

Only with scientific advancement is it possible to fight against cancer. There are little things that everyone can do to help such advancements happen sooner than they otherwise would. Our suggestion is the

# FOLDING@HOME PROJECT


**What is it?**

Folding@Home is a project by the Stanford University that uses our computing power to help study the process of protein folding so as to aid research on various diseases, including many forms of **cancer, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's**.  It is basically a big distributed supercomputer, and you can contribute a node!


## What do I have to do to help out?

All you have to do is install a small program on your computer. Said programs downloads a small amount of data that it analyses.  When finished it then returns the results to the research teams and collects another task to work on. You can even [choose what disease research to base the bulk of your computing power on](http://i.imgur.com/uID425t.jpg) or just let it fold them for all projects! 

## I don't have a 9900k and RTX 2080Ti. Is my effort worth anything?

Everyone, no matter the hardware they possess, has a chance to help researchers fight against cancer and other illnesses, and, perhaps, make a big difference in the life of other people, or even their own. While the better your CPU, and especially GPU, the more folding power, every little bit can help!

[Overclock.net has a good resource where you can check where different GPUs rank on what concerns folding](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vcVoSVtamcoGj5sFfvKF_XlvuviWWveJIg_iZ8U2bf0/pub?output=html)

## Joining is easy and takes about 3 minutes!

1. Visit [this link](http://folding.stanford.edu/start-folding/) and download the installer.

2. Install the software. [(Windows guide)](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/installation-guides/windows/) | [(Linux guide)](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/installation-guides/linux/) | [(Mac guide)](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/installation-guides/mac/)


**That's it!**

You can choose any username you want, even if it's already taken, and select to be part of a team to 'compete' against other teams to see who can accomplish ""the most science"".  [Our team number is 225605](http://i.imgur.com/fbIiZCn.png) but you do not have to join ours. Regardless of which team you join (or even if you don't join any) you are still helping!

In the [initial config screen](http://i.imgur.com/fbIiZCn.png), you can also have a [passkey](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/points/passkey/) e-mailed to you. You can add this string in the app settings, and that will give you extra folding points, under some criteria, if you finish your work units before scheduled!  For higher end hardware, finishing early happens very often!  [Folding@Home benchmarks their tasks on an older first gen i5.](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/points/#how-is-the-qrb-determined).  If your machine is more powerful, you will do better!

## But doesn't this make my computer run very hot?

If you want it to, yes. It is designed to run your system as hard as it can to get the fastest returns on results.

However, you have control as to when it runs and how quickly you want it to run.  Your options are Light, Medium or Full.

* **Light:** CPU is Folding at half speed and the GPU is not Folding at all.
* **Medium:** CPU is Folding at three-quarter speed.  GPU Folding is enabled and at full speed.  Medium is selected by default.
* **High:** CPU is Folding at full blast and so is the GPU.  This will consume the most power and generate the most heat.

You can also control whether or not you want to Fold while you're doing other things.

* While I'm working: Folding is enabled (as above) at all times.
* Only when idle: Starts folding when you leave the machine for a couple minutes.

Many people also find that running it at medium or even high makes no difference on what concerns performance if you're only just browsing the internet. It all depends on your specs.

If those options aren't enough and you want some more control, you have many more advanced options.

* Programs like [TThrottle](http://efmer.com/b/) can suspend and resume Folding based on the CPU / GPU temperature.  F@H already does this, but only at extreme temperatures.
* F@H can be configured so it only uses the number of CPU cores you want it to.
* Programs like MSI Afterburner can make sure your GPU will never go past a certain temperature when folding.

If, instead, you are going for MAX/FULL power folding, then know that Folding@home is designed to max your parts even more than video games or benchmarks!  This means your temperatures will be higher than normal so you will want to check what they reach and/or tweak your CPU/GPU fan curves so they run at a higher speed. Your CPU and GPU *are* designed for this.

Consider running a monitoring program alongside when folding at a constant FULL level. Some program recommendations are [OCCT](http://www.ocbase.com/index.php/software/20-occt), [MSI's Afterburner](http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm) or other similar programs. 

# TEAM PCMR

[Team ""PC Master Race - PCMR""](http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=teampage&teamnum=225605) (225605) has the potential to be one of the top 15 teams in the world.  Right now we are ranked [**21st** in the world](http://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/team_list.php?s=&t=225605#225605) and there is plenty of room for you!

Even if you don't want to join any team, or have another team in mind to join, the important thing is that you join folding@home!

The only time I get can it on to where trey fans run is during a flashbios, however there is no display. Normally using the power button or jumping the pwr pins does not do anything. 

During flashBIOS the debug LED for BOOT stays on, meaning that is the stage my motherboard is stuck on.

- MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX
- RTX 2060super WindfallOC

el0pqd|2020-01-06 21:33:17|Need a recommendation for PC set up|"Hi all,

Thank you ahead of time for helping me with this - I am completely new to non-mac computers and therefore need help.

Background: I am a doctoral student and mostly would use my pc for reading research paper, writing (aka, having 40 tabs open at one time). I do not play any video games, so my needs are somewhat simple.

My budget, including the monitor, is $1600.

I want: VERY FAST loading speed, reliability, ability to handle 10 different apps open without significant lag. Some kind of set up that I can easily sell off when I finish my degree and move out of state.

I also would like to buy a 24 or 27 4k monitor, ideally mounted.

I currently have a 27'' imac and a macbook air 13', and I want to get a pc desktop and a macbook pro 15 instead. or at least, a pc desktop, because one of the research websites I frequent uses a text format that glitches frequently in mac.

Since I am very new to this, I would rather just buy something off cyberpower or an existing desktop machine instead of piecing together everything and mess up. If you have suggestions on what to look for in my case (should I look primarily at the RAM, or???) please do let me know."|kohenw|False|https://redd.it/el0pqd|2|1.0|0|2|1|pcmasterrace

In my attempts I have installed an old GTX 760 I had sitting around from when I upgraded a friend's PC. So I thought I'd install this in, install drivers and just enjoy my game, however now my AMD driver's upon boot are spitting out Error 87 but booting as if normal and my monitor using the AMD card still works fine. I attempted to fresh install my AMD driver's and ended up getting where my mouse cursor was constantly showing it being ""busy"". So I fresh installed Nvidia's drivers and error 87 have started again. Is there a fix to allow these two to run without causing these issues. I am not attempting to use them together for 1 game but 1 at a time for it. Any help is appreciated and thank you.

Before it boots the screen is black with a blinking underscore. Most of the issues related to this revolves around not being able to boot but mine does.

 I've reinstalled win10 multiple times, tried out a bunch of BIOS settings, tried different SATA ports and it's still there on boot when turning it on. Reminder, I can use windows but for some reason it has that blinking underscore when booting.

In disk management I can see ""Recovery (OEM Partition)"" and ""C:"" but the 99MB ""Healthy (EFI System Partition)"" is missing.

Any idea what this means or why it happens?

I ask because I've run across things I don't fully understand in my travels like disabling lanes and speed etc. my motivation for M.2 over traditional SSD is longevity/TBW.

Also, does torrenting put ridiculous strain on SSD's? Obviously there's a lot of read/write going on at the same time but isnit better to keep a spinning disk for torrenting and then move everything over to SSD once completed?

So there are the GTX 10- and RTX 20- lines. Any rationally thinking person will assume that RTX cards, which came after GTX, are better performance-wise, since - wait for it - they have higher numbers on them! GTX 1660 fits the story, since it's better than a GTX 1060 and worse than a RTX 2060 (nevermind the weird jump to 1600). 

But then you come across GTX 1070, which is way better than an a GTX 1660 and also slightly superior to RTX 2060. Also: GTX 1080, which is comparable to RTX 2070, both being superior to GTX 1070. What? Why...? And don't even get me started on all the -Ti and -Super versions!

Why are they doing this? Why are there even RTX and GTX in the first place? Why did they come up with GTX 1660 and then went straight back to GTX 1070?"|LeChef01|False|https://redd.it/ekvshi|4|0.86|0|19|1|pcmasterrace

* Gigabyte b450m DS3H Mobo
* Ryzen 5 2600 CPU
* XFX RADEON RX 570 GPU
* G SKILL 2x8gb DDR4 RAM
* THERMALTAKE SMART SERIES 500W Power Supply.

Up until yesterday everything has been running flawless. I have been playing Rust which is notorious for being pretty demanding. Uncapped I was getting 80-110 fps, but because I have a 60hz monitor I capped myself at 60 fps anyway. Well anyway, I was playing and then my PC shut down straight to black screen. I have to reset the PC to turn it on again. 

&#x200B;

I can run Cinemark CPU stress test with no problems, but when I try to run the GPU test my PC shuts down right before it can render anything. My GPU utilization doesn't even get a chance to jump up before the shut down. I can browse windows normally and If I turn my computer on to power saver mode I can actually complete the GPU test (sometimes). I was even able to play a match of Halo Reach flawlessly. So far I have tried basically everything from re-assembling the PC, reinstalling windows, reinstalling rust, power saver mode, small overclock/underclocks, BIOS resets, DDU Fresh drivers.

* ""Your eyes should look slightly downward when viewing the middle of the screen.""  


But this is exactly the problem, my neck is tilted downwards, which later makes my spine and ends up hurting 40-an hour later. I've been trying to stack a few blocks of paper from the printer to make the center of the monitor rise, but not 100% sure if there is a better idea or what. I also don't get the advice.

Is there a benefit to running games over 144 FPS if my monitor is a 144Hz FreeSync IPS ?

I tested it on one game (Path of Exile) using the F1 key and it said that at 144 FPS locked my frame time was 7ms with a GPU utilization of around 60-70%. If I let the FPS stay uncapped it goes to 240ish with a frame time of 4ms but my GPU is utilized to nearly 100%.

I noticed that, after spending 5-6 minutes in both cases, the GPU temperatures were similar, around 70-72C. The FPS capping didn't lower them in that game.

So my question to you is, again, what's the benefit of capping vs not capping your frame rate if your monitor can output 144FPS ?

At the beginning League literally didn't care if you put vsync on or off but by setting the games profile to standard instead of esport or gaming the problem went away.

Next is Destiny 2 where I still can't understand how to solve the problem which is, no matter the resolution I set the game at, it still sits at around 30-50 fps even dropping below that. I reinstalled the drivers like 3 times now, I fisically cleaned the pc before booting it and I also updated windows.

Does anybody have a solution to this mess please?

el0g9q|2020-01-06 21:15:04|Which 2080 Super to choose for my build?|"I have my build finished up, just need to throw a GPU in. It’s a Ryzen 5 3600, 32gb of ram, 1TB of M.2 storage, and it has 6 Corsair 120mm fans, 3 intake and 3 exhaust. I’m using a ATX Mid Tower case. As for a monitor, I think I’m going to save up and buy a Samsung 49” 1440p super ultrawide.
I’m about ready to buy in a week or two, and want to start narrowing down options. Obviously looking for the most power I can get, and it seems like stepping up to a 2080ti is substantially more expensive, so I think a 2080 Super is better. I’ve never overclocked, and this is my first build, but if I have the cooling I’d definitely be willing to try it.
So what 2080 Super is the best bang for the buck? On pcpartpicker, the cheapest one is the EVGA Black Gaming for around $675. For just under $700 I can get the EVGA XC Ultra Gaming, which has a better boost clock. Both are dual fan models. Is it worth it to go with the MSI X Gaming Trio for $750 because it’s a triple fan card, and would likely give better thermals?
Trying to keep this card as cheap as possible, just don’t want to buy a substantially worse card because I didn’t spend an extra $100 or something buying a better model."|recoil1776|False|https://redd.it/el0g9q|1|1.0|0|3|1|pcmasterrace

So on 15th of January im moving to canada from Switzerland and i have a Lenovo legion with 32 gigs of ram that i just ordered after 2 years of hell and saving up for it.

My dad told me if we cannot find any solution we will just ship it via DHL or something but i really did not want to do that since they probably don’t handle it with care and it would take like 5 life times to get to canada, but i mean i ordered it with DHL so i guess it wouldn’t be too bad XD, i just would prefer traveling with it in a luggage. Any ways the kind of luggage i have in mind is a hard body plastic one with some foam peaces. My father had one for his iMac and it never got a scratch from over 100 hours of flying. If any one wants the dimensions of the pc just search up Lenovo legion gaming PC. Spec doesn’t matter, size is the same from worst spec to best spec. I even wondered if it would fit in a luggage with my fathers iMac or in a regular luggage with some padding. Not sure :/"|beserk-cherelly|False|https://redd.it/ekub1p|3|0.81|0|9|1|pcmasterrace

# APRIL 2018 (bottom right - base build)

**CPU:** *Ryzen 5 2600x*

**GPU:** *MSI GTX 1050Ti Gaming X*

**MOBO:** *ROG STRIX B350-f*

**RAM:** *Gskill TridentZ 3200MHz*

**BOOT DRIVE:** *Samsung 960 EVO m.2 250GB*

**SSD:** NONE

**HDD:** *1TB WD Black*

**COOLING SOLUTION:** *Kraken X-62 280mm AIO, 2 Corsair 120mm RED LED + supplied case fan as exhaust.*

**POWER SUPPLY:** Corsair HX-750 80+Silver

**CASE:** *Phanteks Eclipse P400-S*

# APRIL 2019 (top right - not yet final form)

Upgraded the **GPU** to an **EVGA GTX 1080 SC** and installed a **500GB Samsung 860 EVO SSD** for my steam library. Load times became SO much quicker than when I had everything on the HDD.

# OCTOBER 2019 (left - finito...for now)

Decided it was time for a face lift. The ketchup and mustard 24 pin had to go. Grabbed a pack of **Cable Mod** cables off Amazon that would match my **RED/BLK** build. Swapped out the cable for the GPU as well. Slapped two **Fractal Design Venturi HP-14's** in push config on the Kraken's rad, and put the other two 140's it came with in pull config on the back. Then it was time for the RGB. Two 140mm **NZXT AER RGB's** on top and one 120mm on the back as exhaust. I still just use them as a red colour though XD.

That's it for now. Spring is coming up and that means this build will be TWO WHOLE YEARS OLD, practically arthritic. Thinking of getting a new CPU, probably the 3600x. Technically I would only need the latest bios, which I have, to make my B350 compatible. But I don't think I'd be squeezing all the power I could out of the 3000 series chips with such a dated board.  I'd like to get a new case as well, I'm looking at you NZXT H710!

Will keep ya posted.

ekuq8w|2020-01-06 14:20:30|PC kinda just died a bit|"So I've had my trusty build for about a year and a half now. Its had some slight issues, but nothing too major. I just fixed an issue with a bios update gone wrong 2 or 3 days ago, but nothing wrong since then. 

But last night, it just went out. The pc lights up and everything, and the motherboard led indicates it's trying to boot (it has 4 little leds to indicate if anything's wrong or if it's just booting.) My keyboard gets power after a while, but doesn't change any lights if I hit caps lock or anything like that. The display is just black, but the pc is almost as normal. 

My specs are as follows:

Ryzen 1700x @3.9ghz, cooled by an h100i

32gb 3000mhz corsair vengence rgb (4x8)

Gigabyte ax370 gaming k5 (dont confuse with the regular 5) running the latest f50a bios

Evga rtx 2080

128gb nvme ssd boot drive, 1tb nvme, 3tb hdd

Corsair 570x case, with an rmx 850w gold 2018 and a corsair commander pro to control fans and shit

And 3 different monitors to confirm it's not a monitor issue. Also played my switch on my primary. 

[////neat little divider to keep things neater since I cant make bulleted lists on mobile or know how////](http://google.com)

So what I've tried is:

Reseating the ram, removing all but one stick, and that did nothing. 

Switching the gpu with a confirming working r9 270x, did nothing

Removed all my drives, nothing. (This fixed my bios issue from the other day)

Removed the cmos battery, and held a screwdriver to the reset cmos plugs (which my motherboard says will clear cmos), nothing. 

Tried following a guide which should boot to my backup bios, didnt do anything? (Which it never has done anything for me before). And that's all

[////neat little divider to make things neater that links to nothing////](http://google.com)

I'm currently going to take everything apart. Again, the whole pc lights up, fans turn on on everything, but my screens are black and keyboard does nothing. No errors if I unplug anything like boot drives or ram, or anything. Motherboard doesnt indicate it's a ram, gpu, or cpu issue, but the motherboard does light up and display gpu if I remove it.

So my issue is mainly that there is no DVI port on the back of my GPU. If I were to get a DVI to HDMI cable like the one below, would I still be able to get the 1920x1080 at 144hz?

I already have bad experience with RX5700xt being stutter show, but who knows .. maybe drivers finally fixed something. (was not fixed a month ago)

**RX5700xt costs 580 dollars (Nitro +)** \- previously had Pulse and only game without stuttering was Overwatch

**RTX2070Super costs 700 dollars (MSI gaming X)** or 610 dollars for Ventus OC, but that one looks ... meh. Compared to top edition rx 5700xt

**RTX2080 - NON super** (**used one** with 1.5 years warranty) **for 700 dollars (ASUS rog strix 08G)**

I tried every fix on the planet to make my first RX5700xt work but nothing worked :D what worked in the end was replacing it with old RX590, stutter was immidiately gone. But performance as well. Point is tho ... not using Navi helped me with all the stutters.

I researched the net and checked youtube videos and everyone who had stutters says: I sold it and bought RTX2xxx and it fixed it all for me.

So ... I am thinking of paying extra for useless raytracing :D because I want smooth gameplay. Previously I had 2560x1080 75Hz monitor that I sold and now I am waiting for Viewsonic 2k 144Hz 1ms (we know it's not :D ) to arrive. Heard some people say Navi does not work well on 1080p monitors, especially 75Hz ones. So maybe ... it would fix the issue.

What do you think I should go with? The extra 120 dollars will make me cry a bit :D but ... if all I do is game ... I need it to be good :D"|Yserill|False|https://redd.it/ekw2cz|2|1.0|0|11|1|pcmasterrace

Looking for help finding something to help with cooling my machine.

I am currently running an Ryzen 2700X and an MSI RTX 2070 in my build. When playing games (Borderlands 3) my CPU hovers around 60 degrees using an Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo. My GPU tends to hit upwards of 80 degrees or higher using the stock fan. I would like to get the temps of both down and water cooling seems like the best option, but I am not up for doing a custom loop.

Does anyone know a good AIO that can cover both a Ryzen 2700X and a RTX 2070? Would prefer something I could use on an upgraded component as well.

Thanks in advance for the suggestions.

As a side note, with these specs, what would you expect me to hit in terms of FPS in BL3? I feel like my FPS has been on the low end, around 60. Playing at highest quality.

I use this PC primarily for work, but also game quite a bit during lunch period and in the evenings (work from home) and will be doing some video editing (4K GoPro, some YouTube content).      

Ideally I could play new games on High or Ultra at high FPS, though right now I'm on a 1080 @ 60Hz I will upgrade at some point in the next year or two so I don't mind overdoing it a bit.     

Games I play: FarCry series, Battlefield (single player), Elder Scrolls, Total War series, AC series, Dishonored, Crysis series, Fallout series, etc. Mostly single player FPS, RPG, and some RTS.    

I also plan to upgrade to faster HDD and/or more SSD storage.

Budget would be $300-400 USD for the GPU.

eky905|2020-01-06 18:42:54|Monitor issue|"Yesterday when booting up my pc in the morning, my monitor was not displaying. It was flashing "" HDMI 1"", as if it knew it was plugged into something. Sometimes in the past, when I would be doing something behind my desk, I would bump against the hdmi cable and the display would go away and then reappear. Because of this, I assumed it was a faulty cable and I went to best buy and bought a DP cable. When I plugged that in, problem solved. 

The problem came back this morning. It is now flashing ""DisplayPort"". I now think it might of not been the cable, so I plugged in the same hdmi cable, and it flashed ""HDMI 1"". 

When I click source, if nothing is plugged into a certain port, it will flash the name of it once, and then try the next source. The monitor is flashing the respective source of which ever cable is plugged in multiple times, like it is picking up some kind of signal.

I plugged my nintendo switch into the monitor using the same hdmi cable with success. So I reseated my gpu and I tried both display port and hdmi and still having the issue. Thanks in advance for any response.

I can't really remember what some of them were though, I think one was to disable ""game mode"" or something but I can't remember exactly what or why.

eksu1k|2020-01-06 11:20:16|Monitoring software and optimization|"Hello PCMR! I was recently forced to upgrade my GPU when my 1080 blew up on NYE. I recently upgraded to a 2070 super and have noticed some gains in the FPS region and am happy to see it. However, I'm not noticing as big of a jump as I thought I would. I've watched a plethora of benchmarks on YouTube specifically with my specs and am not getting similar results. Of course I am taking into account the differences in location in said benchmarks and am setting my settings accordingly. Currently, my specs are an i7 8700k @ 4.8 on all cores, RTX 2070 super, 32gb RAM @ 3200 and running on all SSDs including 1 NVmE M.2 for my main drive. 

So my question for you all is this, how do you go about optimizing your system to get the best performance and what is your preferred monitoring software? According to ASUS gpu tweak ll, my temps aren't high averaging 52 on both the cpu and gpu so I can't imagine I'm throttling due to temps.

PS. The game I'm most confused by would be Subnautica. I seem to have significantly lower FPS than others with the same specs or very similar."|Im-Mr-Bulld0ps|False|https://redd.it/eksu1k|3|1.0|0|3|1|pcmasterrace

eku0id|2020-01-06 13:15:45|Questions from a future PCer|Due to an injury at work I am done with my career of 13 years. My plan is to get into Architecture being that I have some Auto CAD and Photoshop experience. I plan on building a PC for this reason. What kind of things should I be looking for to get the most out of my future pc? I plan on running auto cad and photoshop and I also wanted to dabble in some kind of 3D rendering for my walk throughs of houses. I also want to use the computer for some light gaming ( I.E Age of Empires, The Sims, and possibly some games on steam since I already have a few ) As for the budget I’m not too concerned about it but would like to stay around the 3k area. I have a drafting table that will be used as my main desk and I’ll be building a small rig to hold my art supplies, tower and monitor.  I plan on mounting the monitor to a swivel mount on the rig.. what kind of monitor should I be looking for? I’d like something with a good black/color range and decent refresh rate but don’t want to go too crazy since I won’t be playing any high end games.

I play around and discover it will boot but only with one RAM stick inserted. I test both sticks of RAM thinking one is bad but alas they are both fine. (Either one would boot by itself) 

Now here’s the weird part: I reseated all the connections to the power supply and it booted last night with both sticks again. I was playing game and the PC froze. I shut it off with power switch (it was frozen) and had to go back to one stick of RAM again. This morning I reseated all PSU connections again and it booted again with both RAM. 

I can’t figure out what the problem is... any ideas? 

There was no damage done when I cleaned the Pc with compressed air so idk why I’m having these issues in the first place. The PC worked fine for the past year and a half.

ekslpp|2020-01-06 10:56:44|Recommendations for PC build for around 1200 USD|"Hey. I’m going to build my own PC soon. I’ve never done it before but I’m confident in myself because I like tinkering things, doing a lot research and I want a project to fill some empty time I have in my hands.

Anyway. This PC will mainly be for gaming; maybe also for streaming, very little chance for video/photo editing.

I’m not a big gamer, I don’t play online games at all but I want to comfortably play AAA games. My favorite game is (surprise surprise) Witcher 3, and ideally I want to play Cyberpunk without any lag or other problems when it comes out.

The thing is, I haven’t owned a PC since 2013 and I have no idea how the components developed, only thing I know is that I won’t buy a gaming laptop.

I’m not looking for insane graphics like 4K or anything. I can barely tell the difference anyway. I just want a PC on which I can play “big” games comfortably, and for 2-3 years. I can upgrade later on. I just don’t want to make the effort to build a PC then only have to play games on medium or lower graphic settings. 

Any recommendations for parts, pointers to better learn what I’m looking for is appreciated. My budget is, like I wrote in the title, around 1200 USD. Yeah I’m gonna sell my Macbook Pro. I can go higher than 1200 USD but I don’t want to honestly. 

I have no interest in “sick” lighting rigs like LED lights for the casing and such.

eksbtw|2020-01-06 10:27:05|Help me build a PC to join the true Master Race|"Good evening people! 

Ok so I’ll level with you. Since July I’ve been saving up to get a new PC rig. I mean the works. From the desk, chair to the monitor and the all important PC. I need it all

So at the moment I have a budget of $4300 AUD (Australian) (that’s just for the PC)

I’m fairly new to the PC building community. I’ve been watching so many videos trying to learn but I don’t want to spend all my hard saved money to screw something up or make a bottleneck in the system. 

I know the RTX 2080 Ti is overpriced as hell but I’m fairy set on that GPU as it’s quite powerful and as you know. I want to join the master race club.  

My dream is to have a liquid cooled build that’s mostly white with coloured coolant, glass on both sides not just to show off the front components and workings but also the great cable management in the back. I’m thinking of a Star Trek or assassins creed theme so everything matches. 

Any and all advise will definitely be appreciated, it’s kind of hard learning something from scratch but I hope one day soon I’ll know enough to help others out. 

I need particular advice on the PC working but feel free to let me know what chairs or desks are good! Mice and keyboards!

I want to make something to be proud off and show to the world! 

Thanks in advance!

ektml0|2020-01-06 12:39:06|Does slow hardware correlate with slow wifi speeds?|"Hey,

I bought a cheap Win10 tablet to use it with ""Playstation Now"" when I don't have access to my main PC. It has an Atom Z8350 and 2gigs of ram. Should be enough to stream games, right? No!

At first I couldn't connect to my 5ghz network so I thought ""No big deal"" and connected my 802.11ac WiFi USB stick via a ""micro-usb to usb"" adapter to the tablet. Then I installed the drivers and I was able to connect to my 5.0GhZ networks.

But sadly with this setup I'm only able to reach a download speed of 30mbps. With my beefy main pc, the same wifi stick and drivers I'm able to reach download speeds of 200mbps. So the issue must be within the tablet.

I think the culprit could be the slow hardware of the tablet or a micro-usb socket (or micro-usb to usb adapter) that's not up to par with the fast internet speeds the wifi stick is able to receive.

My question: Can slow hardware correlate to slow WiFi speeds? And if the answer is no, what is the issue and is there a possible fix?"|DarkOrb20|False|https://redd.it/ektml0|1|1.0|0|2|1|pcmasterrace

ekr80c|2020-01-06 08:25:13|Here’s my story!|"So I grew up a console player. I’ve owned every PlayStation system made and still have my original one I got when I was 5! Spyro and Crash were my childhood!

When I met my (now) wife, she was really into The Sims. One day I went and bought some Dell laptop for college, but I also loaded all her favorite Sims games on it. It quickly became her laptop. 

Fast forward a few years and now I’ve been bit by the PC bug! I love building things so I want to try my hand at a PC. Of course it will be mostly for The Sims, but I plan to expand and take my gaming to a further level. 

I was thinking of buying a pre built but after showing my wife’s cousin what I was looking at, he quickly advised me to look into building one myself. After about 2 weeks of obsessing over it and watching countless YouTube videos on builds, motherboards, RGB, etc... I think I’ve finally narrowed down what I want to put in my first PC. And it’s actually pretty close to what I was looking at (cost wise) for the pre build. Any advice or further recommendations are welcome. 

With the help of my wife’s cousin and PCPartPicker here it is:


CPU - AMD Ryzen 5 2600


Motherboard - MSI B450 Gaming Plus MAX ATX AM4


GPU - Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 6 GB OC


RAM - Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3600


SSD - Kingston A2000 500 GB M.2-2280 NVMe (with possibility of adding a 2 TB Seagate Barracuda)


Case - NZXT H510 (I really like the simplicity of this brand! Easily mod-able without overkill, my style)

ekqt08|2020-01-06 07:40:42|The subtleties of PSUs?|"Hi!

I‘m new to this stuff, so please forgive me if what I‘m asking is obvious.

So I got that the two main properties of power supplies are wattage and efficiency. There seem to be cheaper brands, such as Gigabyte and higher tier, such as EVGA. 

What I don‘t understand are the differences between seemingly equivalent products of the same manufacturer. For example, Corsair have their RM and RMx lines. The 750 W versions have the same wattage (obviously), are both 80+ gold rated and come with detachable cables. Still, the latter is more expensive and considered a lot better according to some old threads I‘ve read. 

So what else do I need to pay attention to, besides watts and 80+ rating, if I want to buy a high quality, durable PSU? I guess price is a good signal for quality, but in the end we all want to buy the best bang for buck, so there needs to be some better way to assess quality, right?

eksqd8|2020-01-06 11:10:06|What could be the cause for new GPU crashing the whole pc under load?|"My brother bought a 2070s, and replaced his old 1060. Basically when the gpu is under low utilisation, like watching yt and such, it doesn't crash, but after you play a game for a bit, it crashes the whole pc. Sometimes it crashes after an hour, but it can also crash after playing as little as 5 mins. 

After checking what windows said about the crash, it'd say that it crashed because of ""kernel power"".

We reinstalled windows, tried different versions of Nvidia drivers, removed and added the gpu back in, but nothing seems to fix the crashing.

Temps stay in the mid 70s during load, so it's not that.

With the 2070s we had to use an extra psu cable (6pin and 8pin), while the old 1060 ran on only a singular 8pin. So I'm either thinking that the PSU (although being 750w, which should be plenty) is causing the crashes as it can't always keep up with the wattage required to run the gpu, or the gpu itself is faulty. 

I'm more leaning towards the PSU being at fault because if there was something wrong with the gpu, wouldn't it just crash the game, and maybe go black screen, but keep the pc on?

Edit: we going to send the whole pc to the shop where the gpu was bought from, and make them try  running a game with a new PSU. If it doesn't crash with a different PSU anymore, then we know that a new PSU is needed."|EatDatPizza446|False|https://redd.it/eksqd8|1|1.0|0|6|1|pcmasterrace

ekqd1q|2020-01-06 06:54:19|Having some serious issues, please help!|"Hey PCMR, it's been a long while since I was last here and I need some help.

This afternoon, I was vacuuming while my PC was idling on Fortnite. When I turned on the vacuum, I noticed that the lights flickered in the room, likely because everything was connected to the same circuit. I'm sure most of you can already see where this is going. I turned the vacuum on and off a few times, like an idiot, to see what would happen. I finished vacuuming and sat down to play some games and I noticed that there were some major issues. The game turned to a light blue screen and then a grey one and my PC froze up completely. Then, when I tried again the same stuff happened. I uninstalled my graphics card drivers and reinstalled them, but that didn't really help much. Somewhere along the way, I got a notification from windows that the 'PCI bus' was just connected and needs to be set up.

I restarted my PC a few times, running into the same issue each time, and eventually, it didn't turn on. The lights came on and the fans spun up, but 'no signal' was displayed. I tried a few times, and nothing happened, but eventually, I got it to boot. I gave up after that because I know I'm not doing any harm.

&#x200B;

What is broken? I'm really worried it is my graphics card, but I think it might be just the power supply. They weren't exactly graphical issues as much as the whole thing froze and the screen turned a certain color. Could it be something else entirely? 

&#x200B;

For reference, I have an RX 480, a Ryzen 5 2600, and one of these [these bad boys](https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-WHITE-Warranty-Supply-100-W1-0430-KR/dp/B00H33SDR4) as a power supply. The RX 480 is a few years old as I got it used, while the motherboard and CPU are less than a year old. The power supply has been in operation since mid-2016."|AppIns|False|https://redd.it/ekqd1q|2|1.0|0|2|1|pcmasterrace
ekqcxy|2020-01-06 06:54:00|HP 750-424 BIOS/Windows 10 Reset - What have I done|"Hi! I was receiving a driver error/bad pool caller and iql error from scarlett 2i2 audio interface/maybe my audio app. A4ALL drivers never worked, got pc used so had admin issues at times too. so i tried running verifier.exe from windows.

This put my pc in a loop saying there was an issue and it couldn't boot.. after shutting down that night due to drivers not verifying properly but everything was fine before shut down after verifier...

I attempted to restore from a flash drive but was having issues with that so (using mac until i could meet a friend and in my haste>>) i followed some video on youtube that altered my bios/system 32 boot config leading to error 0xc0000098 and attempted to reset to default UEFI settings at some point in this mess. When pressing F2 my bios.bin is not correct/ update is unavailable.

I launched the drive from recovery a different way (how i should have before but missed the option late at night leading to stupidly altering bios/boot config...) and tried to reinstall windows but it was already installed and couldn't repair unless booted up. So I hit delete and format on my partitions in repair my pc under advanced options. Stupid mistake I know but I figured by now data loss was the worst thing that could happen. I deleted every partition damaging system files and recovery files leading to my new error when pressing f1 for recovery environment error 0xc000025 or just staying on that dreaded blue screen.. Being a noob from basic apple and not reading fully I got rid of everything important. Im hoping i have a chance to fix this on this motherboard. i have collected quite a bit of info about my rig. at this point i just want to get everything off the drives if i have to and hard reset EVERYTHING to default? Can anyone help me fix stupid ---> -\_- i mean fix my rig..
