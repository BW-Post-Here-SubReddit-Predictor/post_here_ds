ekwn1l|2020-01-06 16:48:15|Top Board Games of 2019 Holiday Season - Most Viewed vs. Most Ordered|"My friend and I run a website called [Board Game Atlas](https://www.boardgameatlas.com/) and [Board Game Prices](https://www.boardgameprices.com/) and I was curious about trends among board game buyers during the holiday season that just passed by (November to end of December 2019 for Thanksgiving and Christmas).

I tend to have fun looking at numbers and trends, so I decided to make a graph of the data I saw. Some people have told me that it's low res on their phones while others have had no problem, so I'm sorry if you can't read it well!: [https://imgur.com/a/X8hqQ1I](https://imgur.com/a/X8hqQ1I)

Thinking back, I'm not entirely sure it was worth the struggle putting all this together, or if there are any meaningful results for you all to enjoy but hey, I'll be satisfied if there's at least one person who likes looking at stuff like this.

Things to consider:

* The data for game pages viewed are mostly from Board Game Prices (which we acquired back in October).
* The data for games ordered is from our Amazon analytics and leaves out purchases from non-Amazon stores. It combines BGA and BGP purchases, but probably 95% or more is from BGP.
* The high number of purchases for some of these games may be a result of holiday sales.

Things I noticed:

* Wingspan takes the crown as always.
* There are a number of popular (most viewed) game pages that have little to no orders - many of these are Essen/new releases not yet available on Amazon, or games like Root that go out of stock frequently.
* Since it's the holiday season, most of the top purchased games are suitable for family gatherings. Some are also expensive/luxury items for a nice gift to someone/to yourself (e.g. Gloomhaven).
* One person who's looked at the graph commented that it seems to reflect the conflict of what you'd ideally like to buy vs. being considerate of who you'll be playing with.
* The latter half of games share a very high ratio of number of orders to number of views - these games aren't trending/hot but are either generally well received or are well known ""classics"" - Apples to Apples takes the cake with this one, where it's seen 12 orders but have practically zero views.

I hope at least someone enjoys looking at these and let me know what you make out of it! Thanks :)"|tofudad18|False|https://redd.it/ekwn1l|418|0.95|0|68|1|boardgames
ekx7vx|2020-01-06 17:28:59|Wavelength is an amazing party game.|"I saw Wavelength on kickstarter quite a while ago (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alxhague/wavelength), and I was pretty intrigued by the concept. I thought it would be a fun game with big groups, and it had the possibility to scale to however many people we want. 

Everything turned out to be true, and the game is awesome. I'm playing it with coworkers, including ones I haven't gotten to talk to before, and it's a fantastic icebreaker. The game is incredibly easy to pick up, usually taking at most one round for people to understand the game and start playing. I've played with a group of 8 and a group of 16 and the game is equally fun with either size, and infinitely replayable.

Its also an interesting way to see how people thing about different ideas and has led to some unintentionally hilarious moments which will likely be talked about for months.

If you're looking for a fun party game that leads to lots of laughs, and is easily approachable with a relatively short (45ish minutes) playtime, I can't recommend Wavelength enough.

Edit: It's also worth noting that after playing for a few hours, 2 of my coworkers spontaneously bought the game as well. So definitely a hit."|CptJesus|False|https://redd.it/ekx7vx|88|0.95|0|50|1|boardgames

el03mu|2020-01-06 20:50:50|[COMC] Two Player Focused Collection - Update|"So I have gotten many new games over the past year, especially over the Christmas holiday, and thought I would post an update.  Below is a link to a collection image, my BGG User Collection page, and a link to my COMC post from almost a year ago.  Some expansions aren't shown in the image, but are listed on BGG.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/dFaL1Nh](https://imgur.com/gallery/dFaL1Nh)

[https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/strider7476?own=1&subtype=boardgame&ff=1](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/strider7476?own=1&subtype=boardgame&ff=1)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/apommt/comc\_six\_months\_into\_the\_hobby\_just\_purchased\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/apommt/comc_six_months_into_the_hobby_just_purchased_a/)

*How long have you been involved in the hobby?*  My wife and I got into modern board games about a 18 months ago, our first modern board game was **Carcassonne**.  We focus on games that play well at two, but scale up so we can play with friends/family.

*What would you change about your collection if you could?*  We have three really young children and some of our main opportunities to play are when they go to bed at night.  After initially getting into the hobby, we started getting some longer mid-weight games, which we really enjoy, but are challenging to get to the table.  Lately, we have been getting shorter games that are quick to set up and quick to play (**Jaipur**, **7 Wonders Duel**, **Lost Cities**, **Welcome To...**, **The Fox in the Forest**).  This has enabled us to play much more and been lots of fun.  This is one thing we would have changed about our collection, get more short light-weight games earlier.  We still play the longer games, but typically once a week over the weekend.

The games in the lower left corner, **Animal Upon Animal** and **First Orchard** are games for our kids, which they really enjoy.

Favorite Games: All of the short games listed above are some of our current favorites.  We also really enjoy **Viticulture**, **Wingspan**, **Castles of Burgundy**, **Targi**, and **Race for the Galaxy** for longer mid-weight games.  **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** is our favorite party game.  One other thing, I really enjoy watching reviews like Tom Vasel, Shut Up and Sit Down, and Rahdo.  Rahdo's reviews are good because factors in two player playability and doesn't like cut-throat games, which align with my preferences.  I have to say he was really wrong on **7 Wonders Duel**.  I avoiding buying it based on his review, we got it as a gift and love it.  It is not as nearly as cut-throat as he makes it out to be unless you just really wanted to play that way I guess.

Least Favorite Games: I do not like **Five Tribes** in the least, I am no good at it and don't enjoy the game play itself.  My wife enjoys it, but not so much that she wants to keep it given my dislike for it.  It is just too chaotic for me.  My wife thrives in tactical games with changing situations (chaotic), I do better with more strategic, long-term planning games.  I believe **Five Tribes** is one of the most chaotic games I have ever played, and is just not for me.  Also, my wife and I both tend to struggle with analysis paralysis (AP) and this game really brings that out, especially at two players with back-to-back turns, makes the game really long.  We will be selling or trading it soon.  **Patchwork** is fun to play, but I never do well in it, so it is not a favorite of mine, but I still enjoy it enough.  My wife struggles in **Dominion**, but still enjoys it enough to play and it is staying in the collection.  I believe adding some expansions to Dominion that open up more viable strategies than engine-building would help my wife enjoy it more, maybe **Dominion: Intrigue**.

Game Wishlist: Other than party games, I am looking at games that play well at two players.  These are the games I have really high likelihood of getting over the next year: **Schotten Totten**, **Railroad Ink**, **Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small**, **Hanamikoji**/**Jixia Academy, The Quest for El Dorado**, **Time's Up! Title Recall!**, and **Pictomania**.  The two party games are for when family comes over.  My mother-in-law likes **Guesstures** and **Time's Up! Title Recall!** seems like a better alternative to it.  I really enjoyed **Pictionary** in the past and **Pictomania** seems like an improvement to that game.

I also am interested in these games, but need to think more before deciding to get one. **A Feast for Odin**, this seems like a great worker placement.  I would like an economic type game and am interested is **Brass: Birmingham** or maybe **Great Western Trail**.  I would like a dudes on a map / area control game and am considering **Inis**.  I am also looking into **Clank! In! Space!**, **Memoir 44**, **Gaia Project**, **Pandemic Legacy**, and **Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective**.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Also, wanted to say that **Splendor** is one of my least favorites as well.  Again, my wife enjoys it and I enjoy it enough to warrant keeping it though."|strider7476|False|https://redd.it/el03mu|15|0.9|0|9|1|boardgames

ekwg94|2020-01-06 16:34:42|Boardgames vs. Video Games|"*Apologies if something similar has been posted before or if I am not in accordance with the rules... I'm fairly new to Reddit!*
  

I love boardgames and think about them every day. I play them whenever I can. I like video games and think about them just before I am going to play them; which is about once a year. I haven’t owned a console since the Sega Saturn. I feel like I 'grew out' of video games and 'grew into' boardgames. Not that I mean to belittle video gamers nor am I saying this is (or should) be the case for everyone. Sometimes I think about why people might prefer 'analogue' gaming to digital; given the many similarities between the mediums. I've put down my thoughts...
 

**Peacefulness.** I know you can get tranquil video games and that not all boardgames are peaceful but they can ‘flow’ so beautifully. You often have a delicious narrative unfolding in just an hour or two. You get more time to process and contemplate too.
 

**Sharing time and space** The good old fashioned ‘quality time’. Even with the multiplayer solitaires I love to play it’s nice just to have some prolonged joint-attention and shared-interest with other people. Playing two player video games (we would now describe as co-op) was always the best fun.
 

**The tactility.** Say no more.
 

**Intimacy** I feel closer to ‘the craft’ and feel like I'm being spoken to on a personal level. Somewhat akin to the feeling you get when reading a book or viewing a piece of art as opposed to watching a film. You can see the process more easily and marvel at the mechanics. 
 

**The rituals.** Rule-reading. Careful set-up. Meticulous tear-down.
 

**The proximity to our heroes.** I’m sure this is a thing in video-gaming too, but so many boardgame designers and authors appear to be regular Joe's.
 

**The longevity.** Boardgames don’t date like video games. I could happily play a game of **Ra** without consideration of the fact that it’s 20 years old. ~~Sure, they age, but not so noticeably~~. If I played **Crash Bandicoot** it would really only be for retro value. When I played video games I used to pine for the new and would feel weirdly horrible playing an older game.
 
**EDIT** I didn't word this well. I don't think old video games are inherently bad, indeed older boardgames are more likely to be bad (roll n moves etc.). But going back to them gave me a certain feeling. Like if I were to be playing through Red Dead Redemption (which I loved) for the first time now, I'd feel on edge that other people were playing more current things. I know that is completely illogical!


**Sense of direction/Euclidean Geometry**. My skills here are terrible and I’ve always preferred fixed planes. First person shooters are my nemesis!
 

I know people will have a ton of video game suggestions that match/contradict my points. I’d be interested to hear them and any of your opinions on the differences between VG and BG!

ekx3sv|2020-01-06 17:20:36|Charterstone is better than I thought (no spoilers)|"tl;dr: We didn't like Charterstone but it turns out we screwed it up. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good and much better than we thought.

We picked up Charterstone after it first came out. It first hit our table a year ago when my wife and I had three other friends over. We played through the first game ... and we just couldn't get into it. It's not that we hated it, it just seemed too thin for our tastes. Phrases like ""is that all you do?"" were used. We boxed it up and it collected dust for a year. 

Then over the holiday break we decided to give it another chance. We like Stonemeier games, and we like legacy games, so we figured we must be missing something.

We played through from the second game and found the first problem with our initial attempt: game 1 is _really_ limited. You're really meant to play games 1 and 2 back to back, because 1 is so basic, but we hadn't because of time constraints with our friends. Breaking them up really gave us the wrong impression of the game.

We also found that we were misinterpreting some of the rules. Without going into spoilers, we incorrectly thought some of the buildings and effects could only be used when they were in your own charter. This appeared to make the game ridiculously unbalanced. The correct interpretation is made clearer by things introduced in later games, but we hadn't gotten that far.

So we played through 5 or 6 more games, building out more of our charters and enjoying the new buildings. My wife and I each played two characters, rotating through to fill out the emptier charters. 

But it turns out we were _still_ playing it wrong.

We hadn't gone back through the Game 1 cards - we had just started with the Game 2 cards. Unfortunately, the bottom of the last card from Game 1 (or maybe 2) tells you to reveal a series of cards that introduce the story cards and guideposts that set up the narrative for the game. We missed this! We were playing a story-less version of the game where we were getting the new mechanics that come with new buildings, but without any per-game guidance.

We just figured the game was set up to go into story mode once the charters filled out and some number of initial cards were revealed. A sort of ""phase 2"" kind of thing. Nope.

We got to the point where one of the charters had opened all their crates and built all their buildings and was at a dead end. But no story seemed forthcoming. No phase 2. But there were 100+ cards waiting to be revealed. 

Frustrated, I decided to retrace our steps. Starting with Card 1, I reread each and every point ... and finally noticed the line we had missed because of how we'd split apart Games 1 and 2.

This effectively reset us back to Game 2, even though we had many or most of our buildings built and crates unlocked. So we did our best to adapt and played through the rest of the campaign.

With guideposts and narrative, the game is _much_ better. We didn't have the imbalanced charter problem others have described, and found that winner trophies were fairly well distributed. (Though for us, Yellow definitely had trouble keeping up.) My wife and I played 3v3 for the rest of the games, each taking 2-3 hours, but none were boring.

If I had one recommendation for something that would have helped us, it would be a few extra lines on later cards that say something like ""you should have already unlocked crate 1234"" to ensure you didn't miss a line on an early card. There are a few points where this already happens in the game, but that Game 1 to 2 transition is really easy to flub.

Overall, I'd recommend Charterstone for most anyone who is comfortable with worker placement and 2-3 hour games. It occasionally feels like group solitaire, but even then the puzzle solving of it all is pretty good. And the narrative is also good, with some pleasant twists and turns."|rickosborne|False|https://redd.it/ekx3sv|17|0.8|0|10|1|boardgames

ekr6hy|2020-01-06 08:20:36|Can anyone here help with info about pre-release test versions of board games?|"Hi all, I am hoping someone has knowledge of the board game development process. 

I think I have an early copy of Catan from before it was officially released and I am wondering how many of these types of tests sets a company might make and who might have used them. I have been trying to see if anyone on BGG might know but have had no replies yet. 

I have acquired a Catan set that is a draft version of the game. The rules/almanac have hand written corrections that are reflected in the first 1995 commercial release Franckh set. Some of the counters are hand written, and the buildings and roads are not fully painted. The box uses the final Franckh artwork, but it has been cut out and glued to a plain white box, rather than screen-printed onto the card. My thinking is that no-one would make hundreds of copies using hand-written components but I simply do not know. 

This set is also signed by Klaus Teuber and dated 1995, the year Catan was launched, which also makes the game a bit more special for me.

I am really excited to have this unusual set in my Catan collection regardless of whether it is rare or not - but I am keen to know more about why it was made and who would have used it. If anyone can help with any information I would be very grateful.

ekxt95|2020-01-06 18:11:41|Abomination: The Heir of Frankenstein is a great game!|"My wife and I had our first run through of this game last night and man I went to bed still thinking about it. For those who don't know you are competing scientists making a companion for the original Frankenstein creature racing against Robert Walton, the sea captain who has vowed to hunt the creature down.

&#x200B;

You accomplish this by visiting spots in Paris like the morgue to pick up recently deceased bodies, or the graveyard for some not so fresh. Body parts are represented by cubes for muscles, organs, blood, bones, and even animal parts. All of these resources rot over time and actually give you less points if you create a monster part using them. The monster won't be very happy if his companion has a leg that is already mostly rotted away. The game ends if either someone creates their monster and brings all the parts to life or if Robert Walton tracks the monster down.

&#x200B;

Now there is a LOT of components to this game especially for a worker placement game. With the very large board of Paris, our two player mats, and all the tokens and cards, this game barely fit on our table. We aren't sure if we could physically play this up to 4 players. The cards with the cadavers are a bit unnerving as they are very well drawn images of bodies of various stages of rot and damage and could turn some people off of this game. Plus there is something weirdly satisfying with turning in a bunch of cubes and getting a monster part in return.

&#x200B;

The game did run rather long, it took us about 3 hours to get through our first game. I've heard this is a common complaint, but the publisher did release some alternative rules to speed up the game which we are excited to try. Even with the 3 hours, we were having fun the entire time and interested in what we were doing.

&#x200B;

Some criticisms I had are that the randomized player powers seemed a bit unbalanced. My characters power was he would gain stats anytime he was bumped (you can pay a player to ""bump"" their worker off a spot) from the academy. In a two player game, this NEVER happened and seemed like I didn't have a power at all. There are also a few fiddly bits with the event cards such as one that had a different effect if a player had ever visited the church or helped Robert Walton in his hunt at any point in the game which required you to actually remember if you had or not. Bit difficult in a game of this length. 

&#x200B;

Really though they are small criticisms and we are excited to try it out again. There's a lot in the box, and if you like worker placement games and don't mind a slightly morbid theme, definitely check it out!"|miscellaneousobjects|False|https://redd.it/ekxt95|13|0.8|0|7|1|boardgames

To ring in the new year, I'm going to do a quick series here on /r/boardgames about my favorite 20 multiplayer games and my favorite 20 solo games. These are, I guess, my ""favorite"" games, with the following assumptions:

\- I can play the multiplayer games with what I'd consider to be the ideal number of players (this is what I call ""The Mage Knight"" rule of thumb""

\- Time is not a constraint for any of these games (this is ... also what I call ""The Mage Knight"" rule of thumb)

\- How far up a game makes it on my list is some totally nonscientific combination of how fun/cool/neat I think the game is, how well-designed/clever/innovative I think the game is, and how much I want to play the game on any given day, and, uh, other stuff

Oh! One more thing! I do a review series on BGG called [Meeple, Myself, and I](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/222097/meeple-myself-and-i-solo-gaming-reviews), where I review solo board games and official solo variants to games. When I've done longer, more in-depth (and weirder) reviews to these games, I'll link to them accordingly.

ONWARD WITH THE GAMES

**#20**

***Multiplayer: Russian Railroads***

What a delightful, thinky game to start off the list. And maybe the best part of this worker placement train game [without a shared map](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1821521/russian-railroads) is that it positively POURS points onto you by the end of the game. The game holds up well after repeated plays, and it rewards medium-term/long-term strategy much more than many other worker placement games, I'd argue, which gives more tension and stress to the game than I feel in many other worker placement games. (There is only one other even semi-traditional Euro worker placement game in my top 20 multiplayer, and we'll see it lower down on this post.)

I do think that the German Railroads expansion is probably required to keep the game from going stale -- it helps to loosen up some of the more scripted openings and allows for extra customization and exploration. And, although the game is likely dead and never coming back (boo), it can be easily played on Board Game Arena's [excellent implementation](https://en.boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=russianrailroads). I love this one solo, too, but it doesn't crack my Top 20 -- the mindless automa doesn't quite do enough for me to have the game shine as a solo experience.

***Solo: Spell Smashers***  
My BGG review can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2144371/solo-gaming-spell-smashers-meeple-myself-and-i-rev)

Let's switch from the thoughtful, challenging, heavy-ish Russian Railroads to... a word game that you've maybe never heard of? And the solo mode for that game?

I was pretty surprised that I enjoyed this game so much: it just kind of showed up at my house one day, and upon further investigation, the rep I talk to at Renegade games said, ""Oh, I added you to a list for that game and forgot to tell you."" I normally carefully vet all games that I review, so I was nervous. It was weird.

But this game was an incredibly pleasant surprise: you're making words to fight monsters (using letter cards to make words and buy new letters), but the game is excellent at incentivizing you to do clever things with your letters other than simply brute-forcing your way to the longest word that you can fathom. Sure, I like Paperback, and I adore Letter Jam, but this is the word game for me. Great art, a fantastic theme, [an incredibly fun solo mode](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4345926/spell-smashers) that feels like a fully-expressed game on its own, and something unlike anything else in my collection... yay! As I note in the review, I prefer this one solo to multiplayer, because I don't want to have to sweat out making a word while others wait around for me to show that I spelled ""hat"" with my cards after 2 minutes.

**#19**

***Multiplayer: Innovation***

Carl Chudyk's tableau builder is chaos and beauty, insanity and structure all shoved into a whirling, discombobulating experience. I'd probably never play this with more than 3 if I have the choice, simply because things spiral out of control much more quickly than even I like with much more than that.

This was one of my earlier obsessions in the hobby, and it is accordingly one of my most-played games. Of course, I still suck at it, because I'm dumb and bad at games, but I do love this one. [Knowledge of the cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4492244/innovation-deluxe) and its insane, game-breaking, Chudyk-tastic combos are really key to getting the most out of this game: once you start knowing the flow of the deck and appreciate the way things evolve and how to take advantage of what you've been dealt and what your opponents are doing in their tableau, the game really shines.

Innovation highlights something I increasingly care about in multiplayer competitive games: interactivity. You care about what other people are doing on their turns and what their board states are like, and you have to crane your neck and see what bizarre civilizations your opponents are building up as you're progressing through the game. It's also easy to set up and quick to play when everyone knows what they're doing -- both major plusses in my book.

***Solo: Nemo's War: Second Edition***  
My BGG review can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2045702/solo-gaming-nemos-war-meeple-myself-and-i-review)

Victory Point Games is well-known for its outstanding solo games, and this is the first of three games primarily designed for solo play by VPG that appear in my Solo Top 20.

In Nemo's War, you are the (possibly) deranged Captian Nemo, [roaming around in the Nautilus](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3611624/nemos-war-second-edition) and trying to do different things depending on what your ""motive"" for the game is -- maybe you're more science-y one game, and more warfare-ish the next.

The game is fundamentally driven by dice: you'll get actions allotted to you based on dice rolls, and then you'll move your ship around a board, getting treasure, fighting ships, and trying to survive without getting too much infamy (or mitigating that infamy when things start to get out of hand). The most clever part of this game is the resource risking mechanism: you can risk your hull or the crew or even Nemo himself with a roll, boosting the outcome of the rolls you're making. If you succeed, nothing bad happens; if you fail, you lose some effectiveness of that stat (hull/crew/Nemo) for the rest of the game and get closer to losing at the same time. Things can spiral out of control quickly in this gorgeous, unique solo game. The pressure that ramps up near the end of the game, as the ships are closing in around you, is a joy.

**#18**

***Multiplayer: Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar***

This is probably the last game on my Multiplayer Top 20 that features worker placement in an obvious way. But the game is certainly not your standard worker placement affair: you're putting workers down on a [series of interlocking gears](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1447899/tzolk-mayan-calendar) and sending those workers off around the board on those gears. This requires you to think BOTH about when you put your workers down and when you pick them up, because they longer they chill out on the gears, the better stuff they can do for you. (But! Oh no! Then the longer you go without them!)

I understand why some people consider this game's gears to be a gimmick, but I mostly think the gears are either Not a Gimmick or a Forgivably Cool Gimmick. As far as what I love about the game, careful consideration of timing is key for success in this game, and the deep enjoyment of pulling off your last, cool combo on the final turn of the game ranks near the top of my Favorite Discrete Moments in gaming. Pulling off your last batch of workers and squeezing out a few last points at literally the last moment is... neat.

The game is less interactive than I'd prefer, in a general sense, with my multiplayer experiences, but Tzolk'in is a great example of a general principle for my gaming tastes: design a Sufficiently Engaging System (i.e., give me a cool enough puzzle to work through on my own), and I'm willing to forgive a game bordering on multiplayer-ish solitaire.

***Solo: Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition***  
My BGG review can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2339671/solo-gaming-dawn-zeds-third-edition-meeple-myself)

This is my most recently done review -- it went up just about a week ago. This, I'd guess, is another one of the lesser-known games outside of the solo community, and it is the second game published by Victory Point Games on my solo list.

In Dawn of the Zeds, you're controlling villagers who are attempting to [stop zombies from invading their hometown](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3036723/dawn-zeds-third-edition). Much like Nemo's War, this is a dice-tastic affair: it actively strives to be cinematic in nature, and it relies on dice to provide a sense of urgency and tension for much of the game. It is, in short, a ridiculous, strange production. Get ready to roll dice and then hate those dice and then realize a special player power would have allowed you to have more bullets three rounds ago that would have prevented SO MANY OF YOUR PROBLEMS.

More than any other game I've played recently, I've felt myself becoming a sucker to the stories the game lets me tell. The game is... FUN. I've never seen a board game pull off ""campy"" so well while also remaining a solidly good time overall. The game is a commitment, but when you're in the mood, it's well worth the commitment.

**#17**

***Multiplayer: Blood Rage***

We're now starting to get into some of the key things that I really adore about multiplayer board games: clever mechanisms draped around obvious player interaction. [Dudes on a map](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2757554/blood-rage) is a great way to get me interested in a game: you'll usually have a solid opportunity for pretty pieces and lots of ways to mess with what other people are doing in these kinds of games.

I remember, pretty vividly, the first time I played Blood Rage. I remember seeing some of the cards that were being passed around and thinking, ""Oh! Wait! You can do THAT?!?! OH NO WHAT AM I DOING""

And then I lost the game.

The point here (if there is a point) is that the game robustly supports lots of different strategies and fun things to do -- do you want to kill yourself for some points? Sure! Do you want to get neat monsters and romp around the countryside? Okay! Do you want to learn about Norse history? Probably go get a book!

Blood Rage allows you to get meaningfully better at the game over time (an important characteristic of a multiplayer game for me) while also giving everyone interesting decisions throughout the game. It, uh, is good.

***Solo: Fields of Arle***  
My BGG review can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1728564/solo-gaming-fields-arle-meeple-myself-and-i-review)

This is one of my oldest reviews on BGG -- back a whole TWO YEARS AGO when solo gaming was a vast, unknown landscape to me. I knew I liked Uwe Rosenberg's stuff, and I knew that my FLGS in Seattle had a copy of this big ol' box that I wanted to check out. So I played Fields of Arle, and I was immediately captivated.

The game is so genteel and pastoral -- you are placing four workers to represent your family running a farm in Germany. You will get cute little animals and put them around your farm, you'll need to feed your people, you can ship goods off to local towns, and you're running a massive conversion efficiency engine on [a massive worker placement board](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2378854/fields-arle) (or, at least, it was massive before [A Feast for Odin](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3105731/feast-odin) came out). You get points for all sorts of things at the end of the game.

Fields of Arle helped me realize that some games might shine for me quite a bit more solo than multiplayer: I've played Arle with two players and had a good time, but I just kinda generally wondered why the other person was there for the most part. The interactivity of worker placement doesn't usually provide the traction I want and need out of multiplayer games. But, when these puzzley, multiplayer-solitaire-y games become ACTUAL solitaire games, I enjoy my experience quite a bit more.

**#16**

***Multiplayer: Gaia Project***

We finish out our multiplayer games today with a game that makes me go OH MAN THIS GAME IS SO GOOD every time someone talks about it. This is Terra Mystica 2.0, where you are different alien races with radically asymmetric powers that are trying to get points through building different buildings and fulfilling different round-specific requirements while gaiaforming planets around the board.

Again, this game is an excellent example of [A Sufficiently Interesting System Allowing Me to Forgive a General Lack of Interactivity](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3833982/gaia-project). And while it's certainly true that there is interactivity in the game, it's not to the level or degree that I generally prefer in my multiplayer games. You're kinda mostly doing your own thing, and maybe you're upset that people got to some things before you did.

But. The game's systems are just SO MUCH FUN to romp around within. Timing when you place and upgrade your buildings, what tech tracks you're going up, how to leverage your special power, managing your resources, picking the right bonuses to go into the next round, and managing your immediate needs with your long-term plans is just SO SO SO ENGAGING AND NEAT AND THE GAME IS SO GOOD

***Solo: Spirit Island***  
My BGG review can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1920663/solo-gaming-spirit-island-meeple-myself-and-i-revi)

Final game of this post!

I, uh, LOVE Spirit Island. (Spoiler: it's higher up on my multiplayer list, too.) A heavy cooperative asymmetric game that has been thoughtfully developed, has a unique theme, [looks great on the table](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4099092/spirit-island), and provides bonkers replayability through LOTS of different game modes?

Sign me UP

This game is ""only"" #16 on my list because of how profoundly I adore begging other people around the table to help me figure out how to get THOSE DANG SETTLERS UNDER CONTROL DO YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING OVER THERE PLEASE HELP

But ""Catan Fights Back: The Game"" is a delight. In this game, you're controlling one or more spirits that are fighting back against colonists taking over your island. The Spirits are VERY different from each other and really show off how flexible and well-made the game system as a whole is. You're doing scary things and trying to shove around settlers while seeing where they're going to attack the island and build new nasty things all over your humble little island. The game will have you going from ""I am so screwed"" to ""I am literally unstoppable God"" in the blink of an eye.

I. Love. This. Game.

Wow! If these are my number 16s... JUST THINK OF HOW MUCH GUSHING IS TO COME!

ekxlsu|2020-01-06 17:56:56|I made an iOS Shortcut for Avalon|"Happy new year r/boardgames!

Over the Christmas break I created an iOS shortcut to replace the opening narration of The Resistance: Avalon by texting the participants their roles as well as the information they need. An iCloud link to the shortcut can be found here:

https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8b7b53a735054cc99dee71705bfcd228

You may need to go to Settings > Shortcuts > “Allow untrusted shortcuts” to import it.

Before running the shortcut, you will need to make sure each contact is added to your contacts app, with their mobile number appearing above any other numbers they may have.

Here are the user-required steps after running this shortcut:
1) Select the players from your contacts list
2) Select the roles that you wish to play with
3) Review the summary pop-up to confirm your selections as well as the phone numbers of each player. Selecting OK will send text messages in the background to each participant.

The following house rules are assumed:
- Oberon requires 7 or more players (scenarios where more than 2 evils are present)
- Morgana requires Percival to be selected as well
- No assassin role is dealt. Assassination to be discussed as a team by the evils at the end of the game.

Currently working on version 2 which will include Lancelot (expansion role). Would love to hear any feedback anyone might have.

At first I thought ""ah, it's because of the go back, go forward"" action on the back of the tiles, but even then, the tiles are always places in the same rows (6s, then 5s, then 4s, etc...), so the action could have taken this into consideration.

el08lj|2020-01-06 21:00:30|Mechanics masked as other mechanics (sort of) - do you ever think of games like that?|"I thought it was just an interesting thought experiment that I hadn't considered previously until hearing Karuba compared to a roll and write, but here's some examples of what I mean:

- Karuba is a roll(/flip) and write in disguise where the tiles are what you're drawing into your map and the tile draw is the roll aspect

- Gizmos marble row could be replaced by a row of cards like in Ticket to Ride and returned cards can just be placed into the middle of the deck

- Tzolkin's gear system is simply a series of tracks where when you get to the top, you wrap back down. In this case, the gears are efficient instead of pushing each piece up one step on the track

- similar to the above, but each ""gear rotation"" in Tzoklin can be seen as mimicking Agricola's replenishment of each resource each round, sort of, but without stacking

- 2 player Hanabi is like a game where you can see your hand but your partner is the one who decides what to play

Anyway, anyone ever think this of some games, where some mechanisms are actually quite similar to others, at their core? What other examples can you think of?"|AnokataX|False|https://redd.it/el08lj|1|0.57|0|11|1|boardgames
ekha9y|2020-01-05 18:59:14|COMC This is what 300+ games looks like (7 years in hobby)|"Album link: https://imgur.com/a/uPyMx9O

Finished moving and unpacking and finally found my camera charger so it was time to grab these photos. This is me and my partner's collection. I personally got my first game in 1997 (Hacker, from Steve Jackson), but we didn't really get into hobby until 2013 with Android from FFG. 

This is actually in our living room because realistically board games is the most common thing we do with our friends, so instead our books got shelved in the guest bedroom (converted into a study of sorts). 

This photo includes everything except Ginkgopolis that's at work and Arkham Horror LCG that's on the table at the moment. A few of these are signed by designer: Pericles, Root, Tragedy Looper, and Gandhi. If you're a collector notable grabs are Ginkgopolis with expansion, Rococo first printing, the earliest War of the Ring (70s), first printing of Three Dragon Ante, Polish version of Mysterium (Tajemnicze Domostwo), Sol, and the monster 18xx game 18OE. EDIT: Oh, and the vagabond plushie on top right.

Shelves are IVAR from Ikea, the amp is an Orange Rockerverb, and the mostly empty shelf is partner's collection of alebrijes. That shelf will get used as the Day of the Dead altar this year.

One thing I'd do different second time around is switch to vertical storage (like books) earlier. It's made it much easier to grab things vs previously where the games near the tops of the shelves were played more often just cause they were easier to take. Also I should probably do a better job of trying to sell the stuff that we got in discount bins and don't realistically play at all (and generally spend less time thrifting games that we're not super interested in)."|miriku|False|https://redd.it/ekha9y|123|0.88|0|68|1|boardgames

I've tried to get a mix of the classics (e.g. 7 wonders, splendor) and some newer games (Res Arcana, Parks). This being 2019 most of my newer games have been released this year as they're the ones most talked about in the community groups. 

My question revolves around how much staying power do we think any game that's been deemed a best game of the year will have in the future? I've been looking to add wingspan to my collection since it's gotten so much acclaim this year. However, I hesitate because I see a game like Teotihuacan that was considered one of the top games of 2018 hardly ever be recommended or talked about in these groups.  I know the gameplay between wingspan and Teotihuacan is different but is it safe to say that Teotihuacan didn't have the same crossover appeal that wingspan has had from serious gamers to casual gamers? Or, was teotihuacan an example of a game that hasnt aged well?

I know they offer reset packs, and realistically I may never need one, I'd just want to future proof the game as much as I could.

Unfortunately the chairs we purchased don't work the best for it. The seat doesn't have a lot of support, so when you're sitting in them you tend to sink a good deal, making the table feel taller than it should. We've resorted to use pillows to boost ourselves up until we can find a replacement.

Was curious to see if anyone had some recommendations on replacement chairs, especially if you also own a Geeknson table. Any responses would be appreciated. 

I'll post the table and chairs we currently have below.

How long have I been involved in the hobby?

I have been playing games randomly my whole life, but just started my own collection October 2019.

What would I change about my collection?

I want a nice shelving unit to display the games, found a nice one online but it’s very expensive.  

What is my favourite game?

Either Scotland Yard, or Betrayal at House in the Hill.  Depends who I am playing with.

What is my most recent acquisition?

Quarto is my newest addition.  Bought it because I needed more two player games and I was not disappointed.  It’s simple enough anyone can play, but also lots of strategy to the game.

What I haven’t played?

None, I have played all games, in fact we played every game in 11 days.

What game do I think more people should try?

Diplomacy, but it requires players with a interest in democracy, the game is a bit tricky to learn, and can take 4-7 hours to play."|exportablue88|False|https://redd.it/ekfxs6|12|0.64|0|3|1|boardgames

Then on any game, you can click ""Geekbuddy Analysis"" at the top to see all of their opinions at a glance.

Here's some useful people I think make good Geekbuddies:

https://boardgamegeek.com/user/TomVasel - Dice Tower's Tom Vasel

https://boardgamegeek.com/user/rahdo - Rahdo of Rahdo Runs Through

https://boardgamegeek.com/user/eekamouse - Joel Eddy of Drive Thru Reviews Youtube Channel

https://boardgamegeek.com/user/Adam78 - runs the Youtube channel Adam of Wales IIRC

https://boardgamegeek.com/user/mayonesiac - Efka of No Pun Included

https://boardgamegeek.com/user/Quinns - I think he's Shut Up and Sit Down

With this, at a glance at the Geekbuddy Analysis for any game, I can see the ratings and thoughts of a bunch of the popular reviewers and also look up their videos if I wanted, which I think is nice. You can also see commonalities, like if multiple prolific reviewers liked something or vice versa. For example, if I see Rahdo gave a good rating to something, I'm more likely to suspect it'll work well as a 2 player, but if Tom Vasel and Dan King and Joel Eddy all rate it as high too, I expect it'll be a good game that'll have good appeal overall. I think its a good start if you dont know any BGG users with similar tastes to yours.

Lastly, if you're going to a convention soon, its nice to add the convention username geekbuddies if you wanna check their library. Ex https://boardgamegeek.com/user/paxtt is the list of owned games for the Pax Library. There's a similar one for the SHUX and Dice Tower Libraries, etc.

While the game worked fine, most of us realized that it wasn't nearly as much fun as playing with people who are a little more story-focused and a bit less winning-focused. 

Because of the type of game it is, I think that Once Upon A Time may be more suited to a more process and less goal-oriented form of play. The fun experiences and memorable story-results from this game were all from groups where while people were playing to win, they were also playing for the story.

In general, aggressive playing is more of a style/preference by the players than something which necessarily impacts the game itself.

Today, we're talking 2018’s biggest Kickstarter, **Tainted Grail**, a narrative adventure game that just arrived at backers’ doorsteps toward the end of the year, but is already racking up the ratings and climbing the BGG rankings. Tell us how this game found its way into your collection, why it's staying, or why you're getting rid of it. Where does it stack up compared to other games you played this year?

Designers: Krzysztof Piskorski, Marcin Świerkot

BGG Rating: 9.0

Publisher: Awaken Realms

**Game Description:**

> Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon is an unforgettable, solo or cooperative adventure experience for 1-4 players. Blending Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology with a unique vision, it allows you to impact the game world in deep and meaningful ways. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike. Difficult decisions or harrowing choices wait behind every corner and seemingly minor tasks may reverberate with major long-term consequences.

> In a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by conﬂict; surviving each day is a challenge on its own. Starvation, sickness, violent weather, and random incidents all conspire to end your journey. Guardian Menhirs, that ensured safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark turning simple logistics into an involving puzzle. To overcome these challenges, your character develops along several conﬂicting lines, such as Brutality / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of mutually exclusive skills and lead to diﬀerent deck-building strategies, making character development meaningful and deep."|friendshabitsfamily|False|https://redd.it/eka2c8|37|0.89|0|46|1|boardgames

I don't remember the name of the game, and I was hoping someone knew what it was.

It had around 7 players sitting around a map of Renaissance Europe. Each player played as a major European power in the Renaissance, like France, Spain, Sweden, or the Ottomans. Every country had a unique bonus to playing as them, Spain's bonus was 'Declining Empire', and they started with more money. I think the game had metal coins, or at least nicely designed coins. 

I don't remember much more than that, sorry if that doesn't help so much.

ekai8l|2020-01-05 08:42:38|New Fireball Island Thoughts?|"[http://imgur.com/gallery/YoZOdtV](http://imgur.com/gallery/YoZOdtV)

Quick summary to get everyone up to speed.  I got the original back in the day for Christmas when I was 9 and something about it burned into my brain.  So 25 years later I was all in when the restored version hit Kickstarter.  I funded the main game plus both the expansions.  I later purchased the third expansion and most recently the newest expansion, the one with the spiders.  All 5 boxes were still in the wrapper until I came across the right night with the right people to finally unpack everything and play.  That night was tonight.  It took me quite a while to get everything unpacked and set up before my friends showed up.  A couple of my friends were really excited as they were there with me 25 years ago playing the original when we were innocent 4th graders with mullets.    
    
Flash forward to the end of the night and we all enjoyed the game a lot more than we thought we would.  There is quite a bit more strategy than I thought there would be, and of course, knocking people over with fire balls, bees, snakes, spiders, and flying tigers, is just plain fun.  What I'm wondering is what other people's thoughts are on the game, and if you've tweaked some rules to make the game more enjoyable.  Here are a few issues we noticed after playing 4 times through.    


1. One of our friends had to leave after the first game so we were down to 3 players.  We noticed that with only 3 players and having the Pirate Ship and the Spider area expansion the main island seemed a bit baron.  It felt like there was so many opportunities to cause destruction on the main island but 2/3 of the players were always out in the expansion areas doing there own things.  I think this game would be best with 5 players if all expansions are in play.   We were thinking next time not using those two expansions and forcing everyone to stay on the main play area for some condensed mayhem.
2. We felt like there were too many Cataclysm cards, it seemed like no time at all had passed and all the fireballs were in the Scar which triggered the end of the game.  We were thinking about removing a few of them.
3. Has anyone played with a variant where you hold more cards in your hand so you have more play options, maybe resulting in having more cards that pertain to the expansion areas.
4. Any thoughts to making players have to collect 4 Snapshot cards instead of 3 with the expansions added to increase the length of the game.  Maybe this would throw everything off but we all felt that games could be ended pretty quick and before you know it everyone's running back to the chopper.

After all the marbles settled we had a lot of fun playing Fireball Island, even though a lot of that fun was enhanced by the drug of nostalgia.  I enjoyed the game and I feel it's something you can play with mix of friends who are hard core, casual, or totally new gamers.  You can even throw kids in the mix.  I know my 9 year old and even 6 year old will love playing this.  Even if they don't understand the strategy side of it, it has marbles and that springy flippy tiger thing."|Ruttagger|False|https://redd.it/ekai8l|11|0.64|0|21|1|boardgames

*How long have I been involved in the hobby?*

I’ve been playing board games probably since the late ‘00s with Carcassonne and Agricola being my first memory of “real” board games.  My friend also introduced me to Dominion around the same time.  I’ve also been playing magic for almost 10 years now.  More recently, I found a steady group to play with, and we gone through Pandemic Legacy Season 1 and most of season 2, along with games like Terraforming Mars, Spirit Island, and whatever else anyone wants to bring to the table.

Honestly, not too much.  I borrowed Splendor from a friend and would not buy it myself, and I don’t really bring Catan out any more since I’ve “graduated” from it.  I would like to add a mid to heavy euro at some point, but I opted to not back The Great Wall since I didn’t like what I saw.  Anachrony Essential Edition may fill that gap when it arrives later this year.


*What is my favorite game?*

I would say my favorite game is Nemesis.  It’s always a great time when it hits the table.  Every play is another story that’s remembered, which is more than I can say for a lot of other games I’ve played.


*What is my most recent acquisition?*

Sol: Last Days of a Star.  I’m so glad I found this game.  I’ve played it at 4p once (when no one knew what they were doing) and 3 times solo, and it presents a great puzzle to solve.  Every time you play, the buildings are in different positions; trying to figure out the optimal solution is an engaging challenge every time.


*What haven’t I played?*

I haven’t gotten around to Carnomorph yet, but that should be taken care of in the next week.  I’ve played Void Seeders once, and the base intruders numerous times.  I’ve heard that Carnomorph is the most difficult and easy to get out of hand.  I’ve played everything else in my collection.  I’m not one to buy something and not play it.  That said, I haven’t played Blood Rage at 5p yet.  It’s already a cluster at 4, and 5 must be mayhem!


*What game(s) do I have that I think more people should try?*

Sol because it’s fantastic.  Cerebria the Card Game because it’s a tight and thought provoking experience.  The balance between using the engine you developed for the round vs scoring the max number of points is delicate balancing act.  Android: Mainframe is also worth a shot.  At 2p, it’s a chess match where every decision needs to be calculated for maximum points.  At 4p, it’s an absolute cluster where you’re happy to score 3 points in a play.  Also, Pandemic: Iberia is probably the best Pandemic short of Season 1.  It's more difficult than core Pandemic and 100x better to look at!"|bonsai1214|False|https://redd.it/ek4bfj|55|0.8|0|10|1|boardgames

yesterday we played our first session of WotR with the Warriors expansion and had a ton of fun, even though we probably used the factions pretty badly...  
  
We ran into 2 questions regarding the recruiting of faction units that we weren't able to google succesfully, so I'm hoping some of you can help us.  
  
* Q1: Can a standard muster die be used to recruit faction units as well or just the special symbol on the faction die? I'm sure I read this somewhere but I couldn't find it again. (So the same way a Palanthir can be used for all 3 decks, I guess.)
* Q2: If I have the *'Saruman is a neighbour'* card in play with ents on it but 0 ents left outside the board, is it possible to play *'Father of Trees'* with the recruitment? I.e. can I recruit an Ent using a card effect, not a die, if the only Ents that are left are on a stack that is on a different card?

ek2ky2|2020-01-04 21:13:03|Suggestions for selling board games? (Geekmarket, etc)|"Hey! After years of picking up a slew of board games, my closet is becoming a bit too crowded (much to my wife's displeasure lol), not to mention I'm not playing many of them as consistently as others and I think at this point I found my niche in dice games and deck builders. I would like to sell off some of my unwanted board games, all of which are in pristine condition, but I don't want to do it through Amazon since they don't adjust the shipping amount based on weight and size, and since some board games can be quite heavy, I'd imagine the shipping for them would be pretty costly, and then I'd be eating up the shipping cost. 

I just wanted to inquire what website do you all use to sell off your unwanted boardgames?

ejxz3y|2020-01-04 15:32:06|Dune - thoughts after first play|"Hey ! This is an update from my last post about the Dune boardgame.


We have had our first and second game recently.  I must admit it is a nice game.  We had a lot of fun and there were some tense moments.  Ill recap briefly some of the moments I think were nice and some stuff I didnt appreciate.


First game.


I had managed to make everyone ( we were 6) read the rules and watch the videos on how to play.  We checked the rules one last time before starting and I must say it went really well. Things were smooth and everyone knew what they coild or couldnt do, which I think is really nice.  We might be doing this from now on for learning future games as it speeds up the learning process quite a bit.


Games lasted about and hour and a half.  Yup it was quick.  Emperor and spacing guild allied on like turn 2 and by being our first game, we were crushed.  They were making so much spice it was ridiculous.  On firsf turn also, me being Harkonnen, the Atreides player decided he wanted his KH special ability right now so he moved everything from Arakkeen to my stronghold and we were both mostly wiped and couldnt recover. He got his +2 token which he wasnt able to use.  Bad idea, rookie move I guess. 
Game ended on turn 4 or 5, dont remember.


Second game.


Now that was the game.  We learned the hard way that recovering from a bad move is quite hard, and being new to the game lets just say we played more safely.  Game lasted 10 rounds and a  spacing guild / fremen alliance ( wtf ? Lol ) won the game.  It was tight all along.  We kept the same factions as in the first game and I managed to play my 4 traitor cards.  Definitly my most satisfying moments in recent bordgaming history !  Half game we were ( me and emperor ) close from winning but some miscalculations in battle made sure we didint.


I would definitly play again.  We barely touched what the game has to offer.  Everyone liked the game : 4 of us are Dune fans and 2 didint know anything about Dune and yet, they liked it.   As I said earlier, the cost is high for making mistakes or bad moves, no one in both games recovered from theirs.  You have to be carefull about what you do.


The way battles work is nice but really costly.  You cant battle every turn as the revives dont cover the death toll.  There are probably strategies we dont know yet.  


We have played with the advanced rules and I think you just cant play with the basic ones.  Some factions really shine with theirs advanced abilities.


Id give a solid 9/10 as a score.  I wouldnt give 10 just because how unforgiving the game is.  Having more games under the belt might change this score.  It had been a while we had such a nice bgaming day in our group."|chycore|False|https://redd.it/ejxz3y|154|0.95|0|44|1|boardgames

One of the things that we're most confused about are some of the yellow cards. For example the Haven and the arena, when we play those cards do we get the coins right away or do we add them to our end score once the game is finished? Also for the bazar card where you get coins depending on how many gray cards you and your neighbors have, do we collect coins each time one of us or our neighbors play a gray card?

After Christmas update. Not shown in picture : Takenoko,  Complot

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?”**

\\-Not long! My wife and I purchased Catan some years ago and Black Stories was a gift from my job last years. All of the other were purchased in the last months. Prior to that, we went several times to a Boardgame cafe to play several games with friends. I tend to gravitate more and more towards coop games and they are ""friendlier"" to play with my wife. Sadly I tend to win more than her in our competitive games and I don't want her to have a bad time. Coop games also provide (in my opinion) a better solo experience most of the time.

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

\\-Not much, but I may get rid of Viticulture + Tuscany

My current **favorite** are 7 Wonders Duel, Robinson Crusoe and Wingspan. 

In the **shelf of shame**, I have Spirit Island and Flash Point (both new purchase, didn't had the time to play yet).

Today, we're making a break for it in **Escape Plan**, Vital Lacerda's take on classic heist movies. Tell us how this game found its way into your collection, why it's staying, or why you're getting rid of it. Where does it stack up compared to other games you played this year?

Designers: Vital Lacerda

BGG Rating: 7.7

Publishers:

* Eagle-Gryphon Games
* Angry Lion Games
* TLAMA games

**Game Description:**

In Escape Plan, players are the thieves, but they may influence the cops' moves every turn. The robbers move on a modular board trying to reach the best spots to recover their loot and escape from the city with more money than the other thieves. The cops are trying to thwart their escape plan — by force if necessary. The players play cards to aid their escape and slow the other players down. The players take actions that allow them to move and to engage gangs, mules, and snitches.

It contains asymmetric roles set by missions that players may achieve during the game while avoiding the police. The players' roles as thieves are individual with every player for themselves. In the end, only the player who escapes with the most cash wins."|friendshabitsfamily|False|https://redd.it/ejvule|31|0.78|0|20|1|boardgames

ejpo38|2020-01-04 01:51:10|Short Reviews of the New 2019 Games I Played, From a 2p Perspective|" 

I always enjoy reading these lists of shorter reviews, whether as a Con recap or something else, so I thought I would post one of my own. I typically haven’t kept up with new releases, but this year I’ve actually played a handful of new games and played them quite a few times each.

I play mostly two players with my wife and we enjoy lighter games.  Some of our favorites not on this list, for a reference point, are **Quacks of Quedlinburg, Dominion, Quest for El Dorado, Space Base, Qwinto, Welcome To…**  I will be reviewing these as two player games, although I might mention higher player count, but I will call that out specifically.

Order is in the order I played them and I believe all of these were released in 2019, even though BGG lists Imhotep The Duel as 2018, I believe it was a 2019 US release.

**Wingspan**

*Mechanics*: Engine building, egg hoarding

*Playtime*: 45 minutes (all of these will be 2p and include setup/teardown)

The best thing this game does is streamlines the heck out of engine building.  This is the heaviest game my SO will play and it works because it was easy to teach and the forced hand-holding of tracking actions makes things very easy to manage later in the game, where as other engine builders might have players bouncing around to a bunch of different cards/abilities as their actions trigger.  The theme is great, there are multiple routes to points, and fun decisions to be made.  The primary downside is that, despite the high number of unique cards, there are not that many unique ability types, so the game might not be as fresh as you would hope after a bunch of plays (hello Wingspansion!).  This has been a hit, I’ve enjoyed dipping into it as closer to a midweight game.  It plays fairly quickly given what it offers. It isn’t something we want to play every game night, but is always a hit when we are in the mood to bring it out.   **8.5 out of 10**

&#x200B;

**Tiny Towns**

*Mechanics*: City planning, Tetris, wrecking your friend’s hopes and dreams by relentlessly calling out “yellow” on every turn.

*Playtime*: 20 minutes

Dead simple gameplay with a nice amount of strategy.  You have to build as many buildings as you can in your tiny town by matching resource/cube patterns on seven building cards (plus a unique, hidden monument card each player will receive).  The buildings play off of each other to score points and/or make it easier to build more stuff.  Use your Tetris skills to plan well and leave as few blank spaces as possible (those lose you points).  The catch is that you have to use whichever resource/cube your opponent decides on their turn.  This will inevitably thwart your grand plans and force you into scramble mode. Admittedly, with 2p, this scrambling is much less severe than at higher counts, for better or worse.  I loved this game as first but it has cooled down to a “strong like” after a few months.  The reason is that the initial game feels a lot like Dominion: there are a bunch of different cards, you need to read them and devise a strategy on how you can use them together to score the most points.  That’s all well and good, but in Dominion you are much more in control of your own destiny whereas in Tiny Towns you have to make your own plans and also be adaptable to your opponent’s resource choices.  It is a fun bit of chaos to add to the mix, but I’ve sort of come to the conclusion that, at two players, I’d rather just play Dominion and get my spatial planning fix elsewhere.  I highly prefer Tiny Towns to Dominion at 4, and also enjoy it supports up to 6, so it definitely has a place in my collection, it just won't be as a 2p game. **7 out of 10**

&#x200B;

**Twice as Clever**

*Mechanics*: Roll and write, chain reactions, mind melting decision space

*Playtime*: 25

Roll dice, use one to fill in a spot on the corresponding scoring track, repeat a few times, add up your points.  As you fill out spaces, you will earn bonuses which allow you to get free moves in other scoring sections, take more turns, have some redos, and sometimes you’ll get a fox which is fun.  This is a deep, fun game.  It will make your brain hurt trying to figure out which route to take, which die to use, which bonuses you want to trigger, and the timing of doing so.  This was also one of the biggest whiffs I’ve ever had with my SO, it was an instant “no.”  I had played the digital version way too many times before trying the physical game with her, and the connecting of the bonuses and all of the scoring possibilities were overwhelming.  I love what this game offers but personally will stick to the digital version.  **3 out of 10** (for my groups) **8 out of 10** (if I had people to play it with)

&#x200B;

**Point Salad**

*Mechanics*: Set collection, card drafting, hate drafting, vegetable education

*Playtime*: 20 minutes (set of 3 games)

Each turn you choose between taking two of six available vegetable cards or one of three scoring cards.  The scoring cards are all based on what and how many veggie cards you have, getting five points for each pair of tomatoes, or seven if you have the fewest onions, for example.  At the end of the game you score each of your scoring cards individually to tally up your total.  The two player game uses ⅓ of the deck, we like to play a series of three games and tally our totals over those games (Sushi Go-style).  This has been a great filler hit.  We weirdly like drafting games that should fall apart at 2p (Sushi Go and Between Two Cities), Point Salad scratches a similar itch but I actually find it more fun at lower player counts.  You have to be very aware of what your opponent is doing and every choice you make will help or hurt your opponent.  The higher counts end up being a bit more random about what is available on your turn, where as with two you can try to plan a bit (try is a keyword here).  This is a fun, quick filler that offers a fun set collection experience in a nice package. **8 out of 10**

&#x200B;

**Imhotep: The Duel**

*Mechanics*: Set collection, hate sailing

*Playtime*: 15 minutes

A two player game inspired by the SdJ nominated original.  Players place meeples on a 3x3 grid which is surrounded by six boats, attempting to align their meeples strategically to grab specific tiles to fulfil set collection goals.  I like the idea of this game and thought would be a big hit, but it’s just okay.  It feels like it is missing something.  The decisions are too simple, the chances to interrupt your opponent are mostly limited to special ability tiles which allow you to break the placement/sailing/tile rules.  Once you get tiles there is no decision to be made, they simply slide into their scoring spot and you move on.  I haven’t been able to quite put my finger on it, but this one was decidedly average for us.  It does play super quickly and I give credit that the B-side scoring boards are significantly more interesting than the A-side.  Just not for us. **5 out of 10**

&#x200B;

**Bosk**

*Mechanics*: Peaceful area control, vicious area control, squirrels full of pure unfiltered evil and hate

*Playtime*: 15 minutes

Two area control games in one! First, place some numbered trees on a grid and earn points for controlling the gridlines.  Next, follow the path of the wind and place leaves falling from your trees to attempt to control a handful of land areas.  The first portion of the game (I won’t say half because it only takes up about 20% of the total playtime) is peaceful and, honestly, a bit mindless.  Place trees, make sure your opponent doesn’t trick you into having an uncontested line (they get more points for that), and once you know how to play the scores will be within a few points after this phase almost every time.  Ho-hum.  Then the visually pleasing, peaceful looking game about trees hits you over the head with a mind melting, cutthroat area control battle. You place leaves extending out from your trees placed in round 1, attempting to control areas on the board   I see a lot of complaints on this at a 2p game because there isn’t as much conflict, but the reason I love it at 2p is because if you are the sole controller of a region during the leaf phase you get 8 points (those are split 5-3 in normal cases).  That’s a huge, game-changing swing and it makes you agonize over every decision trying to prevent it from happening to you and trying to sneakily make it happen for you.  It also makes those adorable, evil squirrels game changers.  You will place a ton of leaves and you can play on top of opponent’s leaves (taking control of that space) by paying an extra leaf, a nice strategic decision point.  However, once per game you get to play a squirrel which is un-toppable.  It can thwart beautiful plans at the last minute or completely turn games with one move.  I’ve gone on long enough here, but one legitimate downside is that the player colors look way too similar, not an issue at 2p, but man is it tough sometimes with more (the red is difficult to differentiate from both the orange and purple, somehow).  Bosk look amazing, is incredibly simple to teach/learn, gets better with each play, has almost zero setup time, plays quickly, and has become perhaps my favorite filler game **9.5 out of 10**

&#x200B;

**PARKS**

*Mechanics*: Worker placement, set collection, photography

*Playtime*: 30 minutes

A worker placement with a unique worker mechanic that has you marching across a trail, taking actions as you go.  You can’t use a space an opponent is using and there are bonuses for reaching the end before others which gives a fun weight to your hiking speed decisions.  The goal is to collect resources and then trade them in to visit parks which score you points.  There are some other odds and ends to help along the way and each player has a hidden objective which can gain them a few points.  This is the best looking game I’ve played this year and the component quality is A+.  The game is a really fun gateway level experience.  Despite there being so many minor things involved, it is easy to pick up because it is all integrated really well.  I’ve seen a lot of Splendor comparisons, and I get those, but to me it’s a streamlined Lords of Waterdeep.  You won’t get as much depth here, but you will find a game that can be played with less experienced players and is potentially a much more appealing thematic package than fantasy (or not, of course, depending on tastes).  I wanted this to be a true 10/10, but there isn’t enough there, gameplay wise, for that.  It is always a fun, pleasant experience, but it doesn’t have a ton of depth.  It will definitely stick around and get played quite a bit, so that makes it a successful game for me.  **7.5 out of 10**"|empty_glass_mug|False|https://redd.it/ejpo38|154|0.95|0|18|1|boardgames
ejugox|2020-01-04 09:12:10|Which game, currently on the market, offers the best Lovecraft experience and why?|"As the title says, which game gives the best Lovecraft experience and why?

Lovecraft is renowned for his tales of horror and even those which delve into the truly strange and outright weird. His works often feature characters who have their fate taken out of their hands with journeys often resulting in encounters with the servants of the Old Ones or even, on occasion, the Old Ones themselves.

My current favourites would be the Arkham LCG offered by FFG due to its artful weaving of a strong narrative befitting the Lovecraft theme while offering a tense experience. I would argue that it's biggest flaw, but possibly the biggest contributor to why it works, is that the game is incredibly expensive due to a constant deluge of content releases.

The other contender for top spot would be the Call of Cthulhu P&P RPG although I've found that the best experience is often occurs when played with those most familiar with the Lovecraft's writings or by talented GM's. Admittedly neither of these elements are exclusive to the CoC RPG."|FreeFragUK|False|https://redd.it/ejugox|31|0.81|0|35|1|boardgames

It's been about two years in the hobby for us. We still try to keep to a minimum, even though we have already agreed that when our collection grows, we will clear the top shelf and use the space on top of the cupboard to store boxes :)

**Lower shelf**: *back*: Clank! + Sunken Treasures expansion, Istanbul Big Box edition, Terraforming Mars + Hellas and Elysium expansion, Aeon's End: War Eternal, Wingspan, Dune

*front*: Sushi Go! Party, Star Realms, Bang: Samurai Sword, Decrypto, Cyclades: Monuments expansion, TM: Venus Next expansion, Sagrada, TM: Turmoil expansion, Skull.

**Bottom shelf:** Tyrants of the Underdark, Cyclades + Titans and Hades expansions. There are also Codex and Seasons with its expansions, but both are currently sold.

***What changed and why?***

 We decided to focus on games which have high replay value rather than pretty design or peculiar mechanics. Century: Spices and Photosynthesis, unfortunately, fell through by this criterion and were sold. We also had to sell Lords of Waterdeep and Betrayal at Baldur's Gate, because those games are in English, and those who speak English in our community didn't find these games interesting. 

I'm very content with what our collection looks like now, and there are currently no new boxes I'd like to add. Frankly, I'd like to get rid of Cyclades, since I'm nor a fan of the game at all, but my husband loves it very much, so if it makes him happy, I'm fine with it :)"|savageexplosive|False|https://redd.it/ejv5de|20|0.72|0|11|1|boardgames
ejrwbb|2020-01-04 04:47:33|[COMC] 9 Years in the Hobby – Most Generic Collection Ever|"[Photos here](https://imgur.com/a/czJTMjg)

*How long have you been involved in the hobby?*

I am a former MtG player. A friend of a friend gave Carcassonne to my family for Christmas back in 2010. I thought the idea of a board game where you build the board as you played was so fascinating.

My board gaming collection has three sections (in my mind):

1. Gateway Games – 7 Wonders, Dominion, Ticket to Ride, etc. - For about eight years, my family had only been playing lightweight gateway games. We had been slowly collecting them over quite some time. Nearly all of our gateway games were Christmas gifts from extended family and church friends.
2. Solo Games – Mage Knight, A Feast for Odin, etc. - About a year ago, I discovered solo gaming, and I got sucked into spending a lot of money on bigger and heavier games.
3. Medium Weight Euro – Agricola, Viticulture, etc. - This is the newest development. I have finally convinced my family to play non-gateway games. In August, we received Agricola as a gift from a church friend, and this Christmas, we received Viticulture from another church friend.

*What would you change about your collection if you could?*

I am pretty happy with what I have. I wish I had gotten into solo gaming a year or two earlier than I did.

*Favorite games*

1. Agricola – I love how stressful and exciting this game can ben. There is never enough time to do everything. And you are always worried to someone will take the action spot you need/want. I have never found anything as thrilling as winning a game of Agricola.
2. A Feast for Odin – This is almost the opposite of Agricola. While you still never have enough time to do what you want, you can always find something good to do with your turn even if someone takes your action spot. Also, the puzzle board is visually and tactually pleasing.
3. Dominion – This was my favorite for so many years. My best friend has ever expansion. So I usually play with him. These three boxes seem to be enough to keep my family happy.
4. Aeon’s End – I bought this for solo gaming, but it has been a huge hit with my family. They love the lore and the characters and the different monsters. I am pretty abstract when I play a strategy game. But I guess my family members like a little theme.
5. Ticket to Ride – Most serious board gamers are above Ticket to Ride. But I never get tired of it and am always willing to play it. That is why I have four different versions.

*Newest games*

For Christmas this year, I received Viticulture from a church friend and Gloomhaven from my brother. I also just bought The Castles of Burgudy because of [this COMC](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/eelm6v/comc_the_calm_before_the_cull_4_years_and_counting/) .  Shout out to [longtime\_sunshine](https://www.reddit.com/user/longtime_sunshine/).

*Haven’t played*

Just Gloomahven. I just punched and organized it last week. I do not know when I will play it. I am still trying to decide if I am going to do it solo or try to organize a regular group to play with.

*Future purchases*

In 2020, I want to get another midweight Euro for my family. I am considering Concordia, Orleans, Puerto Rico, and Tzolk’in.

Also, I want to get one more heavy solo game. Right now, I am leaning toward Gaia Project."|philipneri|False|https://redd.it/ejrwbb|50|0.79|0|43|1|boardgames

Well, I finally went and got a Kallax like the rest of you, so I figured it was time to post my collection rather than just keep looking at others!

[link](https://imgur.com/a/jLvOgcC) to collection (edit: updated the link with a few more pictures, so you can see what's in the collection a little better)

*“How long have you been involved in the hobby?”*

I've been playing board games with family my whole life, but the collection was rather small until the past 2 years.  I graduated school and now have a disposable income of greater than $0, which has allowed me to increase my collection by leaps and bounds in that time frame.

&#x200B;

*“What would you change about your collection if you could?”*

I wouldn't have purchased Gloomhaven.  I fell for the hype, and had never played a legacy game prior, sadly it just misfired for me.  Too much set up and tear down combined with the fact that the 2nd member of the party was my wife, who doesn't care for RPG's, made it feel like a waste of money. I'd love to start over with a full party of people one day though.  Agricola was also a bit of a miss for us as well.  We just find the game more frustrating than anything, and it plays too similarly each time.  I've been looking into Viticulture to replace it with a more easy going worker placement game.  The only other thing I'd change is to eliminate some copies of Monopoly, but those all came with the wife when we merged collections, and she loves em.

&#x200B;

Our favorite game is Twilight Imperium (4th edition), sadly it doesn't hit the table as often as we like.  We recently relocated for work and are trying to rebuild a gaming group, but even then finding people willing to spend an entire day on a game is a challenge.  Our second favorite would be Terraforming Mars.  I also love Small World, and own every expansion.  It's a pretty simple game, but I really enjoy the different race and power combos.  It feels like an upgraded Risk for me with a theme that I like.  I've been working on making my own custom races for it.

&#x200B;

I'm currently trying to flesh out my collection so that I have a game for ""every occasion and every player"".  I'd like to have a game so that no matter who the other players may end up being I have something they'll enjoy, who knows, maybe I can one day talk them into some Twilight Imperium if they keep coming back.

&#x200B;

With all the new games we got for Christmas it will be a bit before I add to the collection again, but on my radar for aquistion are: Brass: Birmingham, Inis, and Concordia: Venus (expansion and base game).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hope you enjoyed."|JusticiarIV|False|https://redd.it/ejn0ub|76|0.83|0|26|1|boardgames

ejvcpf|2020-01-04 11:00:44|Risk: Legacy Adventures with Family|"So I’ve known Risk to always be a major source of conflict but for Christmas I decided that my parents and fiancée playing with me would be a fun bonding experience for everyone.

My parents are pretty green when it comes to board games, they usually prefer Monopoly or Life. This is one of their first major ventures into more in-depth games and after a few practice games or regular risk, they’ve actually been holding their own fairly well. Both of my parents and my fiancée have come close to winning two games in...close being the operative word. I have won both game’s we’ve played so far, and this last one struck a nerve. 

My fiancée told me I should essentially just write my name everywhere on the board since no one else was going to win. She is normally fairly calm and was just excited the first game that she got to customize a minor city. Right now her PCOS is going full force and she has a cyst on her ovary so patience is somewhat thin.

But this game is making everyone bloodthirsty. My mom usually avoids conflict but she no longer has any problem tearing into hoards of troops to get to an HQ...my fathers strategy is usually summarized as “in due time” and he takes great satisfaction in unleashing his hoards on everyone. 

I’m hoping everyone starts teaming up on me since I’ve gotten some vitriol going so they can start winning games. I enjoy seeing this somewhat darker side of my family."|ThatSoodooGuy|False|https://redd.it/ejvcpf|7|0.77|0|5|1|boardgames
eje1xb|2020-01-03 11:12:21|[COMC] Boardgame Room Setup|"Photos [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/QABpr1G).

I’ve just had to clean out our boardgame room after ash from nearby bushfires got through everything (we are in Australia), and that seemed a good excuse to take some photos and share our setup here.

My partner and I host weekly boardgame nights and so we put together this room for everything (although games inevitably spill out through the rest of the house). I’d seen some awesome setups using Kallax shelves from Ikea and given our house is quite tiny I thought they could also double as nice bench seats with the addition of some cushions. The table also extends which is great for bigger games. 

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

I’ve been playing boardgames for around 10 years now, but only seriously collecting and hosting events for 5 years. 

**Not shown**

Space is a constant challenge so I always combine expansions into the base game box when possible. So most (if not all) games seen include all expansions. I also have all of *Imperial Assault* and *Eldritch Horror* but I stash them away in a cupboard as they don’t typically get spontaneously played. 

**Recent additions**

*Root*, *Tiny Towns*, *Wingspansion*, *Suburbia (Collector’s Edition)* and *Concordia Venus*. 

**Awaiting**

*Eclipse 2nd Ed.*, T*erraforming Mars: Turmoil*. 

**Current top 3**

*Nemesis:* Not actually mine, but is always a blast to play. Our friend group is great at really getting into character and playing up the narrative/thematic side of the game. Each game is filled to the brim with memorable moments.

*Race for the Galaxy:* My partner and I play this almost daily, and after a number of years it’s still fun and challenging.

*Battlestar Galactica:* I don’t get to play this one very often but it was one of the original games I played that really got me hooked on boardgames.

Honourable mentions to *Scythe*, *Wingspan*, *Charterstone*, *Terraforming Mars*, *Gloomhaven* and *7th Continent*. 

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

I’d like to stop automatically buying expansions. For a while as soon as an expansion for a game I liked came out I would buy it, but I am finding more and more that expansions can unnecessarily complicate a game and detract from the experience. I now err towards only buying expansions which mix things up without changing the mechanics of the game (for example, the new Wingspan expansion which mostly just adds more bird cards, or the Terraforming Mars expansion which just adds new maps to play on).

I am also a huge fan of inserts which streamline setup/pack-up. Most of my games have Broken Token inserts but a few (like Alchemists) I haven’t been able to source good inserts for. Consequently those games are played less. I have access to a laser cutter and would love to explore designing my own inserts for them but I have never had the time/headspace to tackle that project."|Cpt_Shipsail|False|https://redd.it/eje1xb|465|0.94|0|71|1|boardgames

ejf7t2|2020-01-03 13:11:06|are all Rosenbergs super similar?|"I am quite the Uwe-fan (very unexpectedly) and hold most of his titles (since I'm also a completionist). Starting a solo session today, I got myself to thinking, do the games really only follow one formula? Is it really enough to warrant owning several of them and what are the considerations for playing them? 

For me, the clear Uwe-mechanics are: 

* harvesting, i.e being forced to preserve a certain resource and pay up at designated times during the game;
* conversion, i.e being able to make something more valuable of lesser goods (smoking fish, making bread etc);
* time limitations, i.e a certain amount of turns, available cards etc 

I believe my first Uwe was Agricola, and I wasn't an instant fan - quite far from it. I didn't think the multiplayer made thematic sense and I vastly prefer heavy conflict games or space operas, so I wasn't exactly smitten. The idea of solo playing was ridiculous to me back then, so it took some time until I tried it again solo, and boy do Uwe's games shine solo. 

Soon after, I got Le Havre and fell in love (although I dont like Le Havre solo for some reason). My spouse prefers Caverna, and I actually think my favourite is Ora et Labora - if it didn't take 4 hours solo, I would play it weekly. AFFO is a masterpiece, but I prefer it solo and it's such a beast to set up that I almost never get to do it. 

Bohnanza is a good choice for camping trips and social gaming, and still features the classic Uwe mechanisms. 

&#x200B;

Many of my gamer friends say this (owning several Uwes) is unjustified as they are all alike, but I disagree. I think each of them scratches a very specific itch within a general larger itch. Kind of like you might have a general like for a ""beach vacation"", but sometimes it means swimming and surfing, sometimes sunbathing, sometimes just cocktail sipping at a Tiki bar."|siretsch|False|https://redd.it/ejf7t2|36|0.79|0|49|1|boardgames
ejqkgz|2020-01-04 03:00:30|Legend of Five Rings LCG—what is it?|"I've played a ton of (and love) the Arkham Horror LCG. I've tinkered with the Lord of the Rings LCG. I've read enough about the Marvel Champions LCG to gain a solid understanding of how it works on a macro level. The Legend of Five Rings LCG, though, is difficult for me to grok. From everything I'm reading (official rule books) and watching, it appears to be a two-player card dueling game (a la Magic: The Gathering and the 100,000 variants that have come out since), but with fixed card sets instead of random boosters. Is this ""all it is""?

I expect there's something I'm missing, as all other Fantasy Flight LCGs have some sort of campaign/adventure element to them. So, what am I missing? Is there a campaign/adventure element to L5R LCG?"|eljayplay|False|https://redd.it/ejqkgz|3|0.64|0|16|1|boardgames

ejo7h2|2020-01-04 00:01:56|Next generation party games: Impressions of two of my favourites from North Star's award-winning line-up|"There should always be room for some good party games in the collection of every gamer. We all find ourselves spending time with friends or family that are non-gamers, and where we need a good game that both they and we can enjoy. It's also true that many people are tired of the usual party games like Trivial Pursuit, Scattergory and Pictionary, which are arguably from a previous generation. Publisher [**North Star Games**](http://www.northstargames.com) is at the front line of a new generation of great party games you really should know about.

Game designer Dominic Crapuchettes began the company, and with the release of their popular title Wits & Wagers he really hit the big time, and North Star Games really began to shine.  Here's a short overview of this fun game and another of my favourite hits from North Star's award-winning line-up of titles.

**Wits & Wagers**

The first real success for North Star was [**Wits & Wagers**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20100/wits-wagers), which subsequently even found its way into big box stores like Target and Walmart. This game puts a whole new spin on the trivia genre, by not making the trivia element play a lead role. After all teams have submitted their answer to a particular trivia question, you may bid on an answer that another player/team has guessed. This is a great concept, because it means that you stand a chance of earning points even if you don't have much idea about the real answer. Is Aunt Joan a history buff? Then let's vote for her answer to the question about the date of a military battle, because she's the one most likely to get it right!

Skill and knowledge is still rewarded, but the questions have been designed with just the right level of difficulty to keep the playing field more level, and to inject an element of tension and excitement that is not present in most trivia games. Being able to bid chips can increase the risk as well as the rewards, so there's room for both high risk and low risk players to have a great time and even win! This bidding/betting mechanic really makes the game shine, and gives it a game-show feel. As a result, Wits & Wagers rises beyond the mundane that we have come to expect from a trivia game.

Wits & Wagers is also ideal for large groups, because players can team up.  I've even run games for over 50 people at a large anniversary event. The essence of gameplay is so easy to explain, making it ideal for new players to enjoy themselves from the get-go. It's quick to play (under 30 minutes), and perhaps best of all, it's buckets full of fun! How many other trivia games do you know that you can honestly describe with the word *fun*? I'm sure there are some, but ""fun"" isn't usually the adjective of choice that most people associate with trivia, but it certainly is true of Wits & Wagers!

Several different versions of the game were later released, including a party version, and a family-friendly version that removes some of the ""betting"" elements and gambling feel of the original to make it more suitable and easier for children.  Whichever version of Wits & Wagers you get, you're bound to have a terrific time with family and friends.

 **Say Anything** 

Dominic later teamed up with Satish Pillalamarri to create [**Say Anything**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33604/say-anything), another big hit that went on to win a string of awards just like its predecessor. It's also a party game, but borrowed the elements that helped make Wits & Wagers stand apart from most traditional party games.

In Say Anything, players write answers to a question asked by another player, and score points by trying to guess which of the answers they think he will pick. Think: Apples to Apples meets Balderdash meets Wits & Wagers. Questions are ones like these: ""What would be the dumbest thing to say in a job interview?"" ""What would be the weirdest thing to collect?"" ""What's the most important quality a person can have?"" Now comes the fun part: Can you think of an answer that the person whose turn it is might pick as the best one? And when everyone has written their answers, can you guess which one you think he'll pick once you see the answers others have written? This bidding/guessing mechanic keeps everyone in the game, and is what makes the game fun for gamers and non-gamers alike.

Say Anything is flexible, very interactive, highly social, and once again it has a huge fun element.  A family edition was also produced for this title, with more kid-centric questions and meeples, and to cater for groups with children.

**Recommendation**

Both these North Star games are excellent, and I recommend them highly.   Besides their many party games, they've also started a fantastic [Happy Planet](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/48480/north-star-games-happy-planet-series) line of party games.  The first of these smaller games was [Happy Salmon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194626/happy-salmon). It can literally be taught in under a minute, and played in just a couple of minutes of complete mayhem and fun.  

There are of course many other great party games available today, and it's not my aim to cover those or discuss them in this thread.  The point is rather: if you've never come across Wits & Wagers, Say Anything, or other North Star games, definitely do yourself a favour, and check out the exciting new world of fun they offer!"|EndersGame_Reviewer|False|https://redd.it/ejo7h2|2|0.6|0|7|1|boardgames
ej9u84|2020-01-03 03:58:56|I spent most of New Year's Day playing kids games|"My wife suggested to my 4 year old daughter that we play all of her games* on New Year's Day.  Here are the games and my thoughts. (Note, some of these may not be games to adult gamers, but she definitely had fun with them and that's what matters)

1. **Surprise Slides Game** (Sophia the First version) - This game is just a spin and move.  The only interesting thing is the ""short cut"" spaces which may let you go forward, or send you backward.  There are four of these and are double sided (one forward and one backward).  Depending on the spinner, these ""slides"" could flip over or change locations. There is zero player agency, however as a kids game it is reasonable for teaching how to take turns and that it's ok if there is a setback (ie. the shortcut sent you backward).  My daughter recognizes when she just needs to ""get past the gem space"" to avoid being sent backward. I think the game is super boring, but she likes it a lot and that makes me happy.

2. **Disney Princess Pop-Up Magic Castle Game** - Similar to the first, this is mostly just spin and move.  There is an added piece where if you land on a gem space, you can flip over one of (players x 3) secret tiles.  If you get a tile that is a character from your princess's movie, you get to move additional spaces.  The presentation for this game is actually pretty cool, because the castle really does pop-up from the board like a pop-up book.  The player pawns are also pretty decent representations of Belle, Aurora, Snow White, and Ariel.  My daughter has gotten better about this one after the first few times being frustrated with (a) not landing on a gem, (b) not finding the right secret tile, or (c) landing on a villain space and being sent backward.  Again, mostly boring for an adult, but she's super into Disney princesses right now, so I'm happy to oblige.

3. **Guess Who?** - We have previously played this game a bunch of times, but as noted in the previous entry my daughter is big into Disney stuff right now.  A few months ago, I set out to create a [custom Disney version](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5145730/sasquatchcc) as the ones I found didn't fit our needs. She loves this version, but nearly always picks Elsa.  Still working on drawing a random one, but I'll take what I can get.  She's pretty good at asking meaningful questions, so I'm very happy with this (and the original) as stepping stones for kids.

4. **Feed the Woozle** - We've played this a bunch in the past too.  Cooperative game where you roll a die (and/or spin a spinner) to determine how many ""silly snacks"" you have to fit on a big plastic spoon to put into the cardboard woozle's mouth.  If playing with the spinner, you also have to walk in a silly way (hula dance, hop, backward, etc.) when feeding.  Teaching turns, failure, directions, and teamwork are nice things about this game.  Highly recommended for younger kids.

5. **Sophie's Seashell Scramble** - Spin a spinner (notice a theme...) and collect a shell.  This is kind of a dexterity game, as the interesting part is that Sophie is an otter and represented by a big plastic tong-like grabber.  You have to find a shell that matches the spun pattern, then pick it up and transport it to your shell mat. Motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and a little bit of ""take-that"" (depending on spinner) are all things that can be taken from this one.  Highly recommended for younger kids.  I think there are other similar versions (**Sneaky Snacky Squirrel Game** I think...)

6. **Outfoxed!** (2014 Gamewright version) - Just got this one for Christmas and it has been a hit.  Basically cooperative Clue-like game where the players try to find out whodunit.  Roll some dice Yahtzee style to get all three to match, then either flip over suspects or move around the board trying to find clues.  This one is fun even for the adults (though I wouldn't play with *only* adults) as the players, upon finding a clue, place it in a slide window to reveal if the suspect has the item found.  Deduction, observation, teamwork, failure (small [bad die roll] and large scale [losing]) are all things this game does well.  Highly recommended for kids.  Does require a little patience and guidance for a 4 year old.

7. **Postman Game** - Also got this for Christmas, and it has been a fun activity.  Flip a card from a large deck and be the first to find the house on a modular board.  First to find it delivers a letter, and the first to deliver all their letters wins.  The cards sometimes show the exact house, but sometimes only show a description (white, blue door, 6 windows).  Language independent so no reading required for little kids.  We've only played non-competitive, although my daughter occasionally finds the house first.  Observation is a big one for this game.  She has also gotten very good at describing the houses, so language development is a nice perk as well.  I couldn't find this one on BGG, but here is a [link to a site that sells it](https://www.londji.com/en/games/857-postman.html) (note: I have no affiliation with this site or game)

8. **Paul and the Moon** - This one is a cooperative roll, move, then memory.  Find the right face-down tile and advance the ""fairy bridge"" but flip the wrong one and the clouds start covering the moon.  If you finish the bridge, players win.  Clouds cover the moon, players lose.  We finally played with the rule where you mix around the face-down tiles whenever you land on specific spaces.  We lost, but my daughter was ok with that.  She did say a few times that she ""didn't like this game"" but that just meant she was frustrated that we were not doing very well.  HABA does a good job with their games and I think this is no exception for young kids. Recommended, but note that the die we have is not weighted very well as the same two numbers come up *far* more often than the others.

9. **Build a Robot** - Let me start by saying this ""game"" is awful.  Even as a kids game.  You spin a spinner to get a number (1-6), Tool, or Lose a Turn.  To start building your robot, you need to spin Tool.  Only after collecting a Tool, do any of the number sections matter. Spun a 4 without a Tool? Might as well say Lose a Turn. Utterly boring.  It has rules for ""younger kids"" which just remove the Tool requirement and add the caveat that if they spin a number they already have built, just keep spinning until they get something new or lose a turn. Ugh. Not recommended.  Avoid at all costs.

10. **Animal Upon Animal** - Another HABA title.  Roll a die and stack some small wooden animals on top of each other.  Dexterity at its most basic, but that's kind of the point.  My daughter liked rolling the hand - which makes another player stack one of your animals.  She also thought it was hilarious when I knocked down most of the animal tower.  She did surprisingly well, and could probably legitimately beat me at this game as I suck at dexterity stacking games. Recommended for sure.


*********  
We didn't get to three others that I'll note below.

* Memory Match: Pretty Ice Pops - Basically just memory with a Popsicle theme.  Last time we tried this she got frustrated with not finding matches.  Also frustrated when someone else used her previous flip as their match.  I was hoping to get to this one to see where things stood now roughly 6 months after the last attempt.  Ran out of time, but may try it this weekend.

* **Hoot Owl Hoot** - I think this is a pretty decent kids game where you are trying to get all the owls home cooperatively before the sun comes up.  There is a deck of cards that have colors or suns.  Each player has 3 cards and can choose any of them to play, unless they have a sun in which case they must play the sun.  One of the owls (difficulty varies based on how many you use) moves to the color you play, but can skip over that colored space if an owl already occupies the space.  We have fun by saying HOOT HOOT every time that happens.  Haven't tried this one in a while, but last time she was a little too young to play by the rules and only wanted blue cards.  Will try this again soon as I think she can handle it now.

* **Where's My Bottom?** - Funny name aside, we haven't actually tried this one at all.  It's all about matching animal tiles together. I'm guessing this will actually be too young for her as she's mostly past simple matching, but is touted as a learning game for observation, matching, animal names, and hand-eye coordination.

I think I'll try to introduce a few others like **Feed the Kitty** soon and then maybe move into some of the Tales & Games series (we have **Tales & Games: The Hare & the Tortoise**). Excited to eventually have a third gamer, but we're more than a few years away from her playing most of our library."|Sasquatchcc|False|https://redd.it/ej9u84|65|0.87|0|32|1|boardgames
ejdu80|2020-01-03 10:48:25|Picked up a couple of games with gift cards over new years (reviews)|"First was **No Thanks!**  I knew it was a classic card game ala 6 nimmt in it's appreciation.  I really think this game is super fun, quick, just the right amount of take that to opponents for a basic card game.  

Played it 3 player with wife and 8 y.o. daughter, and they liked it.  The daughter started grasping the concept more on the second play, as she spent the bulk of the first play hoarding chips and getting numbers ""she liked"".  Second and third plays showed great improvement for her.  

Played it 4 player at a NYE function, and NEARLY managed to go a full round with no cards... ran out of chips on the very last card.  

Then played this 6 player the next day and it was enjoyed by my very casual gamer friends.

IMO works with both big and small groups.

&#x200B;

The other game I got was **POINT SALAD,** thanks to, of all places, The Party Game Cast featuring The Party Game Cast.  For the uninitiated, Point Salad takes the gaming term ""point salad"" to the top degree.  Each card has both a salad ingredient side (6 different vegetables) and a point scoring side (108 unique ways to score points).  The deck is split into three even decks, point side up, and the top 2 cards of each deck are placed below the decks, ingredient side up, to create a 6 card vegetable market.  On a turn you have two options:

* Claim two ingredient cards (replacing them from the respective decks)
* Claim the top point card of any deck for scoring options.

...and as a free action, at any time, you can flip a point card to it's vegetable side on your tableau.  (They CANNOT be switched back however).

Once a deck is emptied, simply split the largest deck in half and continue until every card has been claimed in one form or the other.  Then tabulate points.

I cannot stress enough just how much I love this game.  It plays 2 to 6 (scaling the decks which each player count).  It's quick.  It's chaotic, yet strategic.  It's look is simplistic, yet pretty.

It was a hit with the wife and daughter, despite my wife saying that ""Salad without meat is not a salad worth eating.""  Expansion possibilities?"|AntoniusMN|False|https://redd.it/ejdu80|17|0.8|0|2|1|boardgames

ej84d7|2020-01-03 01:43:43|I am losing my passion for boardgames, what should i do?|"For years i have been extremely passionate about boardgames. I watched tons of videos, got new games, i am always the person that learns games and teaches them. I got countless friends into boardgames where almost every close friend now has their own boardgame collection. 

About a year ago me and my wife moved to a new city where we made lots of new friends boardgamers but the couple we play with the most (my older sister and my brother in law) is more competitive than anyone we have ever met. Me and my wife have a more casual approach when it comes to gaming. We play to win but winning isnt everything. My sister and brother in law are different. They are available the most so we almost always play with them. My brother in law is very competitive and manages to make peaceful games extremely cutthroat somehow, and wins a lot of the time. My sister is unhappy with her husbands play style and almost always rants during the entire game about how he always wins and how his tactics are too aggressive etc. but she tends to use similar tactics in order to win. Usually her problem is that she doesnt win as often.

I don’t have a problem with him winning or her rants but gaming has been a casual experience for me to relax until now. Their prescence immediately turns the general mood more competitive and that makes the experience less fun. We tried games with less interaction where my brother in law has almost no fun (and is vocal about it), but still manages to make the session feel like we are in a tournament. We tried coop games but then they try to quarterback so hard that a 1 hour game takes 3-4 hours because “everyone needs to be on board with every decision” and somehow what they have planned is the right decision. Highly interactive games are a hell because me and my wife dont really enjoy attacking that much, any my brother in law really shines in those games.

Now i dont want to ask my sister and brother in law to change how they enjoy games. If he likes being aggressive thats fine, people enjoy games in different ways. I dont want to stop playing with them either because i dont really think there is anything wrong with how they play and i dont want them to feel like there is. My only issue is, i noticed i dont want to play as much anymore. I check out the subreddit less and less, i rarely watch boardgame videos, i dread gaming sessions. This hobby used to be the best experience for me, i used to be very excited and passionate about the games we were going to play or what new games we were going to try.

I really want that passion back. Im not really sure what i should do. I starter playing boardgames as a couples activity, so we might try to stay away from bigger sessions and just play 2 player games for a while. Boardgaming has become such a regular event in our friend group that im not even sure how we would do that. We have a friend group of about 6-8 people (us, my sister and brother in law included) and we regularly play games. So stopping playing might seem like a passive aggressive move or it might cut us out of our friend group because the major activity we do together is boardgames.

Im not really sure what advice i am asking for honestly. Cutting them out is not an option, other than gaming they are extremely dear to me. They love gaming and want to play games all the time. I just need to somehow get passionate about boardgames again. I guess i just needed to rant a bit and write what i was thinking. I would appreciate any suggestions or stories if you have experienced anything similar. Did any of you have a period where you started to lose interest but got back to normal? Have you played with someone who has a style so different to yours that you needed to adjust somehow?


tl;dr. I dont feel as passionate about boardgames as i used to. Im unhappy about it. Is there anything i can do?"|Mtard31|False|https://redd.it/ej84d7|29|0.68|0|127|1|boardgames

Problems:

1) Saki Bottles weren't held well.  They'd fall out if the box was shaken.

2)  There was a lot of wasted material not doing anything on the file, causing wasted filament and print time.

Solutions:

1) Added some new bosses on the top to hold the Saki Bottle against the manual and board, stopping them from coming out if shaken.  Thanks to the inspiration of brettinman on Thingiverse for the basis for my improvement.

2)  I reduced the material by changing the out cuts, and adding a undercut on the bottom.  My slicer estimates that this is around 30-40 grams reduction, about 20% less filament.  In addition, it reduced the print time from 10 hours on my printer to 8 hours.

In all, I hope these changes work well for all the print it for themselves.  Any feedback is welcome.

From the release email:

## Capstone Games Announces Second Title in the Iron Rail Series:

>In **Ride the Rails**, you will invest in railroad companies, build railway track across America, and deliver passengers to as many cities as possible. Each of the 6 game rounds features 3 phases:  
>

>  
>*Build Railroad Track*: each player may build Railroad track in companies that they own at least one share.  
>  
>*Ride the Rails*: each player transports a Passenger to a city, paying dividends (points) to all shareholders.  
>  
>Each round, a new Railroad company is introduced to the game, and each Railroad company has its own special placement rules! Deliver passengers to as many cities as possible to earn the most points. Be cautious in your travels, as shareholders of Railroads that you use will also earn points!  
>  
>Ride the Rails is a game of simple rules (only 1 sheet of paper) with varied strategies & tactics for 3 to 5 players ages 12 and up, playing in about an hour. Contents include (subject to change): 1 game board, 5 player boards, 162 wooden locomotives, 52 wooden passengers, 7 tracker disks, 15 player disks, 1 round marker, and 1 rule sheet.

I prescribe to 'less is more' and try to sell/give away what I don't play/love. 

I've still never played at an organised event, only with friends and family members whom I have forced into the hobby. Get between 1 and 2 games in on a good week. 


**Not shown**

Gloomhaven (under the bed until we finish Pandemic Legacy) 

Cathedrals and Inns Carcassonne expansion 

Castles of Burgundy the Card Game 

The orange bag is Hive Pocket and the red one is Love Letter. 


**Recent additions**

Teotihuacan, Concordia, Puerto Rico, Nusfjord, Trajan, Targi.


**On the way out**

DR Congo, Mafiozoo, Unbroken, Tiny Epic Galaxies

A mate bought me Emira as a joke for Christmas as he thought I'd find the slightly offensive theme a bit of a chortle. 


**Not yet played**

Targi, Puerto Rico, Trajan.


**Wish list**

Orleans
Viticulture 
Agricola
Fresco
Great Western Trail


**Current Top 3**

Castles of Burgundy
Arkham Horror LCG
Clans of Caledonia 

I think Concordia and Teotihuacan will be contenders for the top 3 but have only had one play each.


**Most underrated**

Steam Time (just needs a retheme!)


**Most overrated**

Hanabi or Mysterium (both sold on)

Would love to hear any recommendations for future games, based on my collection!

eixe48|2020-01-02 12:00:04|End-of-year discussion: Pax Pamir (Second Edition)|"This series is a chance to discuss some of 2019's most notable releases. Today's game is **Pax Pamir (Second Edition)**, the well-received overhaul to Cole Wehrle's entry into the Pax series, a cutthroat tableau builder set in 1800s Afghanistan. Tell us how this game found its way into your collection, why it's staying, or why you're getting rid of it. Where does it stack up compared to other games you played this year?

Designers: Cole Wehrle

BGG Rating: 8.4

Publishers:

* Spielworxx
* Wehrlegig Games

**Game description:**

>In ***Pax Pamir***, players assume the role of nineteenth century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire. Western histories often call this period ""The Great Game"" because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.  
>  
>In terms of game play, *Pax Pamir* is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly."|friendshabitsfamily|False|https://redd.it/eixe48|197|0.91|0|113|1|boardgames

ej45m2|2020-01-02 20:56:54|[COMC] Fairly new to hobby (& Reddit)- ended 2019 with 19 games!|"Started with Catan, now we [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/bDfi4iT). 

I was introduced to Catan a couple years ago but really started growing my collection in the last year or so. 

My favorite so far is Villainous; big Disney fan and I enjoy how uniquely each character plays plus the variety the game offers. Can't wait to see more expansions!

My 2020 board game goal is to play more of Grimm Forest and a little less of the party games. Though it is nice to have some quick and easy games to play and explain- especially for someone who is fairly new to explaining how to play a game and yet always finds myself having to do so. 

A couple of my highlights: 
1. Jaws was a surprisingly fun game and I'm happy to have a co-op game in the mix. I thought it would be like battleship and I'm happy to report it is not. 

2. Ramen Fury was calling me each time I saw it and I don't regret it! It is as fun as it is adorably packaged and portable!

3. I have 3 games I have yet to play and bought on impulse (no regrets yet) and those are Ticket to Ride, Foodie, and Bob Ross Art of Chill. Monster Crunch was also an impulse buy; love the colors and that I can drag anyone into playing it. The fact that it was on clearance doesn't hurt.

My niece played as Han and she managed to get the Falcon upgraded, get Chewie as a crew member, AND do the Kessel run job.

I've had a few playthrough's now, and my biggest complaint is the slow start.  I find that with the 5 total items trade off, you generally go 2/3 birds, and 3/2 food, the first round is basically playing 2 birds, and hoping that the food dice are in your favor, but your still pecking at it 1 food at a time. Then by end game when your engines are just starting to run, the game is over.

There are 2 variants that i have read at BGG that sound interesting, wondering if anyone here plays anything similar that feels balanced, or just sticks with standard rules.

1. Card Draft - instead of the random luck of 5 cards, each person is dealt 6, and drafts 1 card at a time then passes the deck to left (7 wonders style).  then discards the 6th card, this way you are getting birds that will fit your strategy based on your bonus card.
2. Keeping 5 food/no trade off - just exactly that.  get some birds on the board early so you have more time to strategize/more time to look through the plethora of bird cards.  rather than the slow food grind of the first round."|duggz67|False|https://redd.it/ej0r4o|36|0.72|0|21|1|boardgames

What I am curious about is that It seemed like we basically just had the same 6-10 Infection city cards pop up over and over again as they get reshuffled into the top of the deck with the addition of the one card from the bottom. Especially because very early in the game we Eradicated Yellow, and 4-6 of the top 15 cards were yellow, meant we had very few new cubes coming out on our infection turns. Is that right, that we keep getting those freebies? We didn't use much of the infection deck at all and we never ran into an Outbreak or Chain reaction (so the piece stayed at 0 the whole game).

Also, she was a Contingency planner. This meant we got to use every Event card we liked twice because she would immediately take it back upon my or her first use, and then stick it on her role card, and use it a second time either immediately or soon after.

As a dispatcher, I was often using my moves and city cards to charter flights for her piece when she was moving around to eradicate diseases."|Doc_Seven|False|https://redd.it/ej00pr|25|0.77|0|32|1|boardgames

The bookshelf version was the trendy one, so it was more expensive even though the innards were exactly the same. I remember this had a profound effect on my thought processes - I still wanted the bookshelf version even though I was now completely aware that it was a waste of money.

Now, years later, I'd like to track the game down. The game involved resource collection in an effort to build the first ship to reach another galaxy. The cover had ships on it flying towards your viewpoint (well, to the left of it), and I remember one had a ring habitat section at the ""near"" end.

It was part of a series of similar games, including various stellar exploration versions (which he recommended as a good introduction to the field) and I recall I went looking them it because I saw an ad for the complete series in a magazine - Omni? Creative Computing? Given the era, it's almost certainly Avalon Hill, but I've looked over the AH game list on the wikipedia and BGG, and I can't see anything that fits the description.

I seem to remember an old blog post that coined the term “cult of the new,” but now that I look for it, I can’t find it anymore. Here is what I remember, but keep in mind that part or possibly all of this could be my memory playing tricks on me:

—This was from around 2012

—It was written by Scott Nicholson, an amazing youtuber, one of the first, who has since mostly stopped making videos

—I remember this coming out shortly before Scott stopped making videos and shortly after the Dice Tower started gaining traction (the era when Tom said “shut the door” in the middle of every episode).

—In the post, he argued that it felt like all the unhealthy hype the community generated lead to people buying more and more games. He coined the term “cult of the new” to describe this behavior.

—It may have been in the comments of that very post that someone coined the term “cult of the old” to describe the grognards who describe those who just play the same old games again and again.

—I remember there being some kerfuffle in the comments to that post, but it never got super serious.

—Shortly after, people started using the terms “cult of the new” and “cult of the old” somewhat jokingly to describe their personal boardgame taste.

Does anyone else remember this? I’ve done a search on BGG, but can’t even find any evidence that Scott ever even had a blog! Any help would be greatly appreciated."|philly_beans|False|https://redd.it/ejassw|0|0.44|0|9|1|boardgames
ej4tab|2020-01-02 21:42:29|Dune (2019) Get Gud?|"I broke this out with my usual Twilight Imperium crew, and it was a lot of fun. All of us went in with some knowledge of the setting, but no knowledge of the rules. We did a rules read at the table, looked at the FAQ a little and then randomly distributed factions and were good to go. Oh... except for the boyfriend of one of the players, who really only likes Euros and has never done anything “heavy”. 

The game was great! The Emperor player had 2 strongholds by turn 3 and was slapped down hard by the Fremen and the BG, to the point he thought about just going home as he felt he was rendered irrelevant. Later in turn 6 the Harkonnen player would deal with back-to-back treachery cards in Carthag and Arakeen, wiping out his army and filling up the tanks.  There were ups and downs, huge swings with troops getting wiped out by BG wielding lasers and shields like the zealots they are, and the prescient Atreites even blew up a shield wall just in time for a 5 space storm to ravage the major strongholds.

It was thematic, and sneaky, and fun. But...

We saw three huge stacks owned by two factions wiped out, one of which was controlled by the aforementioned boyfriend who had to have “kingmaking” explained to him. Battles depended less on armies and more on leaders, and leaders were dependent entirely on the projectile/poison/shield/snooper game of rock-paper-scissors. In the end the Emperor, who thought about packing up, won the game with the help of the Spacers, and the Harkonen almost won with the help of the BG.

I can’t tell if this is great game design or not. We had fun, which is most important, but I’m worried the battle system is too random. My chits on the board seemed to matter less than the one in the battle wheel. 

Is it possible to get good at this game, or do even veteran players have to deal with the randomness of the battle system?

That in order to declare the suspect, weapon and location, you have to go to the middle room first and declare it there. If you get it right, you win, if not, you put the cards back and are out of the game, but are allowed to answer questions. This might seem simple to some, but for countless years, my family were under the belief that if nobody could dispute your guess, you immediately take the cards out of the envelope and reveal them if they’re right, so long as you yourself cannot disprove your own guess. 

So, after going through these rules with my family, it has proven to be rather controversial. We had a heated debate on which rules is the right rules. I believe it’s getting to the middle room, since you can trick other players into losing by bluffing and using your own cards for guesses, but some in my family still cling to the old rules, hating the idea of having their own skill and cunning stolen by players who didn’t do anything. I’ve argued that you have to keep the suspect, weapon and location a secret until you yourself can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt it’s the real deal and by making a question which no players have, including yourself, you’ve just clumsily given the answer away and now must race to the middle room to stop the other players stealing the thunder.

Now, I do enjoy the game, and I'm NOT arguing it isn't a game. But I still prefer Arkham Horror 3rd or Eldritch Horror to MoM. I think I feel this way because every time I play MoM it feels more like an experience than a game. The easiest way to explain my thoughts is I feel MoM is a choose your own adventure but with skill checks. 

I think I get this feeling since so much of it is governed by the App, and most of your choices are investigating tokens. When I reply a scenario or old one in AH 3rd or EH (not as much) I do lose the fun of the new experience and story. Yet, I think the gameplay is more exciting. I have a few choices each turn on have do decide how I will talk those choices. With MoM when I replay a scenario most of the gameplay is about exploring than game mechanics. 

I don't want to go into too much detail here but what I mean is in the other games I can makes choices on where to go to improve my character a specific way by buying items, getting improvements, or encountering themed/skill oriented encounters. MoM it is more about just moving and finding the tokens you need to investigate. There is of course choice but more narrative not mechanical. 

I wanted to know other players thoughts on this. Basically if I want to ""play a game"" I almost always want to play AH or EH over MoM. If I want more of a experience (think would rather watch a movie type mood) I break out MoM."|filbert13|False|https://redd.it/ej0lrw|5|0.67|0|12|1|boardgames

eiw4cv|2020-01-02 09:27:08|One Night Ultimate Werewolf: 4 Players, 1 Wolf|"My family recently began to play One Night Ultimate Werewolf. There are four of us, and we repeatedly encountered the following scenario.

After some discussion, we would become fairly certain that two of us were villagers, and that among the other two exactly one was a wolf (often because they are the two with conflicting claims). But at that point, the two non-suspects can simply each vote for a different suspect. According to the rules, in the case of a 2-2 tie, both candidates die. Then the wolf really cannot stop themselves from getting killed, giving the villagers an almost guaranteed win.

This ended up happening so often that we decided to adopt the house rule that in this scenario, with a lone wolf, all the villagers need to vote for the wolf in order to win. It was much too hard for a lone wolf to win otherwise.

My question is, is it really supposed to be that difficult for a lone wolf to win in a four-player game? Is the goal of a lone wolf really to sow enough discord that *two* other players are suspected, even though on their own they've only got one vote, and it's hard enough trying to cast suspicion on just one other? Is there some sort of obvious strategy we're missing for a lone wolf to get out of such a sticky situation? (I realize that throwing a Tanner into the mix might resolve this issue, but I'm curious whether there's any other way.)

Any thoughts and tips appreciated; we're still fairly new to this game.

EDIT: To clarify, when I say ""villager"" I mean any member of the village team, be they a Villager or a special role."|Phiryte|False|https://redd.it/eiw4cv|4|0.67|0|9|1|boardgames

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?** -
I have been in the hobby seriously for about 4 years now, but I have played games since I was a child.

**What would you change about your collection if you could?** -
I would buy less games honestly. I play a lot of games every year, but only a handful are from my collection. I play games with 5 other people, and between us, we probably have 750+ games! There are a few games that I have played once or twice, and I also have 5 on my shelf of shame. Over the last year I told myself that I wouldn't buy as many games. (My girlfriend also told me this) But that didn't seem to happen as I added 32 games/expansions in 2019. It also didn't help that for birthday's and Christmas gifts, I seem to get board games as well! I am sure I will slow down once I fill up all the cubbies in my shelves. That or I may get more shelves since there is room for it. Who knows right now, but there isn't any plan to cull anything as of yet!

**Current favorites:** Kingdomino, Sagrada, 7 Wonders, Dixit, and Castles of Burgundy. I love these games as they are all really fun for me and my girlfriend! 7 Wonders is the only one that she doesn't like as it is too much iconography, but it's still one of my favs. 

**Current Shelf of Shame:** Dominion, Catlantis, Tak, Bosk (just got this for Christmas!), and New Dawn (not pictured).

**In 2019**, I managed to play 258 times, with 111 different people, and 145 different games of which 92 were new to me. Of these 111 different games, it turns out that I played 62 games of my own. So maybe I do play more of my own games than I realize? My H-index was only a 5 as I played so many different games. Wingspan, and Birds of a Feather were at the top of the list for me at 8 plays a piece. My girlfriend is really into birds, so this isn't too surprising!!"|debeerzerker|False|https://redd.it/eio6qy|32|0.76|0|14|1|boardgames

eipe6r|2020-01-01 23:11:35|[COMC] Small but growing collection|"Hey r/boardgames!

First off, here is my current [Collection](https://imgur.com/a/QCUHUik)

And my [Board Game Geek Collection](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/Jarllax?objecttype=thing&ff=1&subtype=boardgame)

***How long have I been involved in the hobby?***

I have been involved in the hobby since before I was a teenager.  I played the traditional Monopoly type games growing up and was then introduced to Magic The Gathering by my cousin shortly after it came out in 1993.  At this time, I was only nine years old but immediately fell in love with the game.  I played and collected this for a few years.  Unfortunately, I have no idea what happened to my collection and could've probably bought a new house with it if I still had it today.

After this I got into the Marvel Overpower card game for some time  after it was released in 1995, then got pretty big into the Star Wars CCG by Decipher when that was released later that year.  My friends and I got into that quite a bit and even entered some local tournaments in our city.

After that, I took somewhat of a hiatus from tabletop gaming and began playing more roleplaying games with my core group of friends.  We played a lot of Dungeons and Dragons 2e and 3e in high school.

It wasn't until around 2007 that I got back into board gaming when **Last Night on Earth** was released and a friend brought it to our annual gathering of friends.  We played that every year we would get together and I eventually bought it as my first modern board game.  Later in 2011, **Eclipse** came out and that replaced LNoE and my collection has only grown since.

***What would I change about my collection if I could?***

There's not a whole lot I would change about my collections at this time.  My friend and I got pretty serious into **Star Wars: Destiny**, I spent a lot of money on it and now we don't play it.  Same thing happened with **Star Wars: X-Wing**; however, thankfully that never got much past the core set as far as my collection goes.  I have never culled anything from my collection, but that will probably be the first to go.

***Favorite Games (In Order):***

1. ***Tainted Grail:***  Just received this in November and it is already my favorite game of all time.  I absolutely love the theme and the story of this game.  In my opinion, there is nothing else quite like it in the market today.
2. ***Arkham Horror: LCG:***  Was introduced to this game in our annual gathering of friends and very quickly fell in love with the game.  I absolutely love the story telling this game does.  The theme, the deck construction, I love it all.
3. ***Eclipse:***  As mentioned, this was one of the first modern board games I fell in love with.  It is still one of my favorite games, even though it doesn't get played as much any more...**Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy** should hopefully be arriving very soon /fingerscrossed...
4. ***Root:***  I love the theme of this game and the direct player confrontation.  My gaming group instantly fell in love with this game and I cannot wait to receive the new expansion soon so I can try out and learn the new factions and play on the new maps.
5. ***Terraforming Mars***:  This was a new to me game in 2019 and I wish I would've gotten it sooner.  I love the way that the different corporations play differently allowing vastly different combos and we recently began playing with the drafting variant which completely changes the game for the better.  I haven't decided yet if I want to get the other two expansions **Venus Next** and **Colonies**.

***Newest Additions to my Collection:***

My game purchasing has slowed down pretty significantly as of late as I am trying to work through my unplayed games at this time.  I have still been acquiring expansions for my favorite games though.

Newest Games:

* ***Tainted Grail:***  I got this gem on November 8th and it has already quickly become my favorite game.  I am playing a two player campaign with a good friend and we are slowly chugging through it.  We are currently on chapter 3, but almost have it complete (I believe).  Easily my most favorite game of all time already!
* ***Q.E.:***  Just got this for Christmas so I haven't had a chance to play it yet.  It looks really interesting and I'm excited to try it out.

Newest Expansions:

* ***Terraforming Mars: Turmoil:***  Haven't had a chance to play this since my Kickstarter copy arrived.  Terraforming Mars is one of my favorite games so far.  We have only got 10 games under our belts so far and have only been playing with the Prelude expansion.  We've recently started playing with the draft variant and definitely won't be going back.  I look forward to getting this out the next time we play TM.

***What games haven't I played yet:***

* ***Fury of Dracula:***  I've heard so many good things about this game and thought I needed to have it.  It just hasn't hit the table yet due to other newer games taking precedent.
* ***GROWL:***  I bought this when my gaming group was pretty consistently at 5+ players each game night.  However, due to work schedules this has dropped to 3-4 players each session so it hasn't found its way to the table yet.
* ***Q.E.:*** I just received this for Christmas this year and we haven't had any game nights yet.  I expect to get this to the table very soon.
* ***Santorini:***  I bought this with playing it with my SO in mind.  Unfortunately, she's not much of a gamer so it hasn't hit the table yet.  I bought this when it was extremely cheap in a Target sale.
* ***Sleeping Queens:***  Bought this with my daughter in mind.  Seems like a cute little game to play with her that has a neat theme and has simple math involved.  She's still quite young though, so I haven't even tried teaching it to her yet.
* ***Specter Ops:***  Again, got this in a great Target sale and it just hasn't hit the table yet.
* ***Spirits of the Wild:***  Another two player game that I bought to play with my SO...just hasn't seen play yet.
* ***Star Wars: Imperial Assault:***  Bought this when it was on sale on Amazon.  Haven't had time to start up a new campaign game yet.  We're currently working through an Arkham Horror: LCG campaign when at four players, and Pandemic Legacy S1 when at three players.
* ***Werewords:***  A newer addition to my collection that came with ONUW and Ultimate Werewolf for $5.  Just haven't had gotten this to the table yet.

These are meant to drum up discussion, not to validate or invalidate your feelings on a board game, your opinion is as valid as mine. I find that I generally enjoy games that are in the medium-weight or higher on Board Game Geek, but I do have many lighter games that I’m fond of as well. I look forward to reading responses and getting to hear your opinions on these games.

#Point Scale Guide:
1-2: Awful game, I hope I never have to play it again.

3-4: A game I did not like at all, but I see some redeeming qualities to it.

5-6: Generally indifferent to this game, but willing to play it when asked.

7-8: Generally a fun time, I might really like some aspects of this but might have some minor issues with these. I’ll generally play these any time.

9-10: Excellent games with little to complain about. I am almost always up to play these games.

The idea was no buying new games, focusing on playing existing games, and no new hobbies or media for an entire year.  

It sparked off a [lot of interest and commenting](https://old.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/9u3qlb/maybe_we_should_all_consider_a_board_game_depth/).  Last month /u/atomiczap posted about [their experiences with their own attempt](https://old.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/drp5lj/my_depth_year_a_review/).

In Reiner Knizia's High Society, players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth (positive-number and multiplier cards) while avoiding its pitfalls (negative number and divisor cards).  While bidding, though, keep an eye on your remaining cash - at the end of the game, even though all those positive-number cards might add up to a win, the player with the least money isn't even considered for victory.

eiqkj5|2020-01-02 00:43:58|Some early thoughts on Dune|"We played our first game of Dune over new year's eve and I was curious about the communities thoughts on our experience.

Some caveats - we played from about 11:30 - 2:00am so were somewhat sleepy. It was not a fair representation of the fully fleshed out game because of our inexperience. I had an okay understanding of the rules but was teaching to four other players who knew nothing of the game. 

Okay then initial thoughts - 

Are alliances fair / balanced in a game of 5? One person cannot join an alliance, possibly through no fault of their own. Does that just eliminate them from the game? I ended up winning as part of an Atreides Emperor alliance. How strong are alliances? Is it viable not to ally?

Is paying spice to fight intuitive or worth it? It seems like playing the full game and NOT using the spice for combat rules is a massive nerf to Fremen, however by far the most fiddly part of the game seemed to be when we were using spice to fight, that's where all the rules mistakes and balls ups happened. Do you include this rule or not? 

Anything else that you could suggest for our next play? I know that Harkonnen and Fremen were frustrated and felt unable to do much - but they both understood that's likely because they're just learning the game and are keen to play more."|Kucifus|False|https://redd.it/eiqkj5|5|0.69|0|20|1|boardgames

Hi, I discovered today the game Railroad Ink. I played alone to begin with, to learn the rules and to be able to explain them to my BF. I love it so far though I have a doubt concerning the longest highway/railroad. I thought maybe some of you could help me; I checked, the last posts about Railroad Ink didn't give the answer to my question. 

So, to count the points of the longest way, **you count the adjacent squares of paths that are linked together, uninterrupted**. [With my last try,](https://ibb.co/TtZNVLP) I wasn't sure how the rule translated. 

* What I wanted to do / how I wanted to count :   
[I put colors on my picture, green is what I wanted to count.](https://ibb.co/qnwXhn9) I wanted to count everything because (1) every square in green is linked to another square in green, so the rule uninterrupted is respected, (2) the squares are indeed adjacent, and all linked together in one network, so it's still respectful of the rule written as it is. That would be 21 in my picture.
* What I did / how I counted :   
I had in mind what ""The Longest Way"" means in the board game Ticket To Ride, meaning that you can put a train at the beginning of your path and make it go to another end without using the same portion of the way twice. [That's how I did in purple here.](https://ibb.co/WD4dXM7) That's however only the translation of ""longest railroad"" which is more an interpretation, as said above counting in another fashion doesn't seem against the written explanation of what they mean by ""longest railroad"". I ended with 12 points. 

What do you guys do when you play? 

If I am mistaken in the way I read the rules of understood them, and if the way they're written is clear enough, don't hesitate to point it out."|youvegotpride|False|https://redd.it/einswl|2|0.87|0|3|1|boardgames

18NewEngland is designed by Scott Petersen, the owner of All-Aboard Games. It’s based on many of the concepts found in 1861/1867, but taken in new and interesting directions. 

1849 is a reissue of an old design. This game is mean. Knife-fight in a phone booth is a good way of describing it. Money is tight, the map is unforgiving, every choice just feels like you’re taking the least bad option. If you like a challenge, this is a good one. 

1822MX is another Scott Petersen design. It takes many of the concepts of 2016’s hit title 1822, and applies them to a smaller map. The game takes place in Mexico, hence the MX in the title. Some interesting shifts in the design here lead to a smoother and faster playtime than the original 1822. 

Rolling Stock Stars is a version 2.0 of Rolling Stock, a clever 18xx style game that is played purely with cards. 

Shipping is included in the price. The games are expected to be delivered August 2020 or sooner. US/EU/Asia/Canada/Australian-friendly shipping, no unexpected duty fees. 

They’ve also opened up pre-orders for a second print run of 18Chesapeake, 1817, and 18MEX, which will also be delivered at the same time."|philequal|False|https://redd.it/eifh5x|50|0.92|0|66|1|boardgames

eia4ms|2019-12-31 22:49:45|Brass: Birmingham - A gaming bliss|"I had my eye on Brass: Birmingham for over a year and I finally bought the retail version in October when MM had it in stock for $38. I learned the game from Rodney Smith's 'Watch It Played' and a few other Youtube videos. Couple of months ago, I test-drove the game in solo mode using a couple of amazing automas found on BGG before teaching it to my group recently during the holiday season. Wow! What amazing game play does Brass present!

I'm mostly an euro-gamer. Brass: Birmingham hits all the right notes for me - epic, thinky, tight, engrossing, and more interactive than most euros. Along with Concordia, A Feast for Odin, and Great Western Trail, it has vaulted into my will-play-anytime, 10/10 zone.

The game seems heavier and fiddly at first but once the basic concepts of the game clicks, especially the consumption of coal, iron and beer, it just flows easily. The weight of the game has to do more with the agonizing decisons you got to make during the game play than with the rules. I love that there is no one dominant strategy to win this game (or, at least, I haven't come across one yet)

Every time a game is completed, I want to replay it right away but alas, my gaming group wants to play the next game. I solo sometimes using the aforementioned automas from BGG but the game really shines at 3-4 players.

There is a symbiotic relationship in Brass that you cannot and should not avoid purposefully. Sniping the opponents beer or iron or coal is a task you need to do to flourish in the game. Trying to deny your opponents points can get you into trouble later on. This is just one example of the multiple layers of strategies in the game it. Pre-planning, setting a course, solving the puzzle and finally, seeing it all come together when you flip a cotton mill or pottery by consuming your (or any) beer is a wonderful feeling. I know this applies to all games but, to me, it is just extra fulfilling and satisfying in Brass than in most games that I've played. No wonder this game is so highly regarded and rated (rightfully so)

Art doesn't matter to me (I like the art on all my games equally, yes, even Concordia/Salsa box arts, GWT box art, and the old version of CoB's box art and player boards, etc.) but know it matters to a lot of people. Art and production quality are stunning in Brass: Birmingham. I only own the retail version and use regular poker chips to play this. I've seen the Deluxe version with the Iron Clays in videos and I can only imagine that the Deluxe version's aesthetics would be even more fantastic.

If you get a chance, please do yourself a favor and play this game. I'm sure you'll fall in love with it like I have.

&#x200B;

Just to give you all an idea of the type of games that I love, here are my top favorite games in my collection:

**Brass: Birmingham**

**Concordia**

**A Feast for Odin**

**Great Western Trail**

**Castles of Burgundy**

ej23gf|2020-01-02 18:34:34|Theme is superfluous in rules explanations.|"I am not a fan theme at all. Give me a good game with interesting mechanisms any day. If there is an interesting theme involved, great; but unnecessary for me to enjoy a game. I can appreciate that not everyone is like me, and that's totally fine. However, I contend that when explaining rules to a game, it is always better to explain without the presence of theme.  People are much more likely to understand the sentence, ""If there is a cube on the hex, then you get a point."" vs. ""If the field is being tended, the boat moves up the river."" Introducing theme adds a layer of abstraction to seemingly simple statements. This relies on the learner to apply additional thought to decoding the abstraction that could be used to simply understand how the game works. 

I know most people will disagree with me here. I also understand that some people will argue that a good theme makes some rules explanations easier to retain because the mechanisms are related to the theme in a way that logically makes sense. That is a valid argument, and admirable when pulled off. But this scenario I find to be the exception and not the rule. 

I guess I am just curious if I am alone in this opinion, or if others agree that theme during rules explanations can be superfluous?"|hhlodesign|False|https://redd.it/ej23gf|0|0.22|0|24|1|boardgames

ei4fvw|2019-12-31 15:44:01|[COMC] 4 years into the hobby, new to r/boardgames|"Hey everyone,

after recently quitting Facebook I decided to now focus on r/boardgames (and BGG) for everything boardgame related!  
And what better way to start it than with a COMC post. 

[Here is my current collection sprawled across two rooms](https://imgur.com/a/TVKvTa0)

 ***How long have you been involved in the hobby?*** 

I began buying/collecting modern boardgames around four years ago when looking for a hobby to get into. As a teenager (so 10-12 years ago)  I played **Magic: The Gathering** a lot and also attented a local board game meetup where we played mostly Magic but also other older games like **Ticket to Ride**. Having fond memories of those times, I decided to re-visit boardgames and I could not be happier with that decision! There are just so many amazing board games being released every year and attending the Essen Spiel the last three years has always been a magical experience.

***What would you change about your collection if you could?*** 

I try to not let my collection become any larger, so I regulary sell some games to make room for new arrivals. In 2020 I will receive **On Mars, Tainted Grail, Etherfields**, Stretch Goals for B**lack Rose Wars**, more **Cthulhu Wars** and the expansions for **Anachrony, Root** and **Dice Throne** so I definitely need to cull some games before they arrive.

***Games that might leave the collection soon?*** 

* **Brass: Lancashire** or **Brass: Birmingham:** I have not played Birmingham yet, only Lancashire three times. I plan to only keep one Brass game and following the majority of BGG it will likely be Birmingham.
* **Photosynthesis:** It is a pretty good abstract game, and I really do like the small amount of theme it has. Nevertheless, I would rather play something more thematic or complex most of the time.
* **Near and Far:** I also really like this game and planned on playing the campaign(s) with my SO. However, she rarely wants to play boardgames and its hard to get immersed in a story when you play once every 2-3 months. Also, I prefer  playing the German version of such thematic games with lots of reading in it.

F***avorite games?*** 

* **Arkham Horror LCG:** With 52 plays, this is the most played game in my collection. I love the Lovecraft mythos and playing a new cycle of Arkham Horror with two players is always a blast. The deckbuilding aspect is really immersive, too. Maybe your character is an ex-firefighter and a puppy-lover? Include the cards Fire Axe and Guard Dog in your deck and it is done. The core gameplay and the decision-making between scenarios are also excellent.
* **Black Rose Wars:** We played this at Essen Spiel before the Kickstarter launched and had a blast. The designer, [Marco Montanaro](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/107031/marco-montanaro), has a burning passion for his game and it showed during his explanation. We all went all-in during the Kickstarter and since the delivery of the core game (and the Crono expansion) we enjoyed every single game of it. Every player controls a battle mage and need to program their next turn by playing spell cards. Black Rose Wars is highly competitive but most of the times no hard feelings are involved. There are six different magic schools, each with several different spells. You can cast fireballs at each other, steal each other quests, teleport around the map, deploy traps, summon monster and so on. The huge amount of spells offer many different combos to explore in each play. To summarize, the game has LOTS of content which offer LOTS of fun. I am very excited for the coming expansions and stretch goals. 
* **Cthulhu Wars:** This is my favourite area control game. I already mentioned that I adore the lovecraft mythos and nearly everything from the mythos exists in Cthulhu wars. The achievement-like spellbooks are fascinating and moving the huge ""mini""atures around is really satisfying. Each fraction has a unique feel to it and with all the different maps and neutral monsters each games feel different to each other. It is really expensive, but luckily I managed to grab a lot of stuff for a good price.
* **Gloomhaven:** I had a difficult start with Gloomhaven. When the first Kickstarter was delivered my group began playing it immediately. However, since I was writing my bachelor thesis at that time I did not find that much time to play board games and thus my group often played Gloomhaven without me. I missed so much of its content that I chose to just not play it anymore. Some time later I bought Gloomhaven for myself and played the first mission with my SO and two other friends. The other players did not enjoy the game, and so I decided to just sell it again.  
But now, roughly 2 years laters, I bought Gloomhaven again (this time in German) and I found another group to play it. We played the first three scenarios and already planned our next session. We all love the game!

***Newest games on the collection?*** 

Just today I arrived a package with the following games:

* **A fake Artist goes to New York:** I play to play this on New Years Eve in approx. 3 hours from now.
* **Wingspan: The European Expansion**: So far, I only played Wingspan once, but since I am from Europe I want to see familiar birds when playing it.
* **Gloomhaven: Solo Scenarios**: As mentioned before I recently started playing **Gloomhaven** and I plan to play the solo scenarios once our characters achieved a high enough level.

That is all. Thanks for the read and happy new year!"|I_LIKE_PORTALS|False|https://redd.it/ei4fvw|408|0.93|0|66|1|boardgames

My partner and I would like to begin playing more board games. We picked up Splendor as our first but haven’t had chance to play it yet, however it has prompted me to do more research and I really like the idea of a deck building game.

My research concludes that there’s two that would appeal to us Dominion and Marvel Legendary. We would probably only go for the base set of each initially unless there was a set you could get for less than £100 (stock seems to be a problem for Dominion).

We both really like Marvel but are also into general RPG games and so the lack of a specific theme in Dominion isn’t too much of an issue, although I am a bit concerned about the stock. Marvel Legendary is a bit more expensive to get into (£45 for the base set) but looks like the expansions are easily available etc.

What would you go for?"|Brad_1|False|https://redd.it/eigce8|12|0.83|0|71|1|boardgames

The art is terrible, research is spotty and the lack of thought put into it really bothered me. So I found templates online and made my own. Got everything printed and everything.

eiwf6x|2020-01-02 10:04:11|Parks is a fucking hurricane! Definitely my favorite boardgame in 2019.|"Tldr at bottom Here is the BGG review of it.

https://nerdsonearth.com/2019/09/parks-board-game-review/

I picked up a few games recently because of this sub, Parks and Wingspan. Spirit Island is on its way, too! Parks is a fucking hurricane. It’s hands down my favorite game I picked up in 2019. 

**Aesthetic**

It started off as an art project and is absolutely gorgeous! Jaw dropping the prettiest game I have ever played, and I’m a sucker for visuals. Part of the reason I can’t bring myself to buy Terraforming Mars. They had 30+ artists working on Parks. Every single piece of of the board, game, and resources is a crafty piece of art.

**Mechanics**

The mechanics are medium, I’d say 3/5. My family I played it with compared it to *that bird game* as they called it aka Wingspan, and it definitely has a little bit of engine building to it. First time through we stumbled while watching a review and a play through. 

2 player game takes about 30-45 minutes. 4 player game adds more components to it, and especially with new players, can double the time. So about 25 minutes per player added. 

It’s a pretty quick game to learn that seems at first to have very elementary strategy but is quickly found out to be thick in the strategy department. There are some parts that aren’t super balanced, for example whoever starts the game is whoever had the last hike in real life.

Each round can be started by a person that has a specific “reservation” token if they earn it. The person to the right gets a camera and the only way to get the camera is to take a photo of you land on a very specific tile. Gives a power dynamic 

**Game time and cost**

The components fit perfectly in the box. Super nice insert design, nice and tight. Art is even on the INSIDE of the box. 

Price is $30 when we got it, so very reasonable. This could easily be a $60 game that I would buy. 

I do wish the cards were bigger. They aren’t tiny but just I’m 6’ and nearly 200 lbs. I’m a big person with big hands. I like having a big game board and big cards to play with. But it isn’t microscopic like the ticket to ride cards. 

**TLDR**

Overall, highly recommend this game. It’s beautiful and we’ve already played it 4x since opening the box last night.

it’s pretty fun. Very indirect competition betwixt other players. Certainly no direct conflicts. Visually appealing and challenging enough while keeping everything clean."|INTHEMIDSTOFLIONS|False|https://redd.it/eiwf6x|0|0.35|0|10|1|boardgames

eieuhg|2020-01-01 05:59:49|Would my family enjoy Cyclades?|"So I enjoy heavier board games (my favourite board game is Dominant Species) but my siblings are hesitant to play games that take more than 5 minutes to explain. We just played Isle of Skye and my siblings really enjoyed it. They also liked Sagrada, The Quest for El Dorado, Gemblo, Santorini, and Forbidden Island (so very light games). 

I've been thinking of getting Cyclades, Blood Rage, or Kemet for a while now because I know that I will be able to play them with my friends. However, I'm pretty sure that my family would not enjoy Blood Rage or Kemet as they may be too complex. Is Cyclades an easy game to grasp?

eib44d|2020-01-01 00:08:45|My 14er H-Index 2019|"2019 was the year I discovered solo gaming for me. I put in 82h **Too Many Bones**, 47h **A Feast for Odin**, another 47h **Cloudspire**, 20h **Spirit Island** and 19h **Gloomhaven**. _(The first three mostly solo, the latter with my group.)_

I played a total of 567h, 117 different games and a total of 725 plays.

[BG Stats Screenshot of all my played games sorted by play count](https://i.imgur.com/ZbqHGnJ.jpg)

Another change was that I _wanted_ to focus more on heavier games… which isn't always possible depending on the group your playing with. A lot of times I'm with my parents in-law and can't introduce a new game, but can nonetheless enjoy classic, simple games like **Lovecraft Letter**, **Tempel des Schreckens**, etc.

As for mechanics, engine building turned out to be a thing I enjoy tremendously. On the other hand, I'm not really drawn toward deck-builders anymore. I also have purchased/played enough Roll'n'Writes… the one and only I'm looking forward to would be **Rome and Roll**.

Like mentioned above, I play solo a lot of times, followed by sessions with my girlfriend, we play wirher her brother, with our group and just around the corner is a weekly meet-up where on can check out new games and people.

I bought approximately 90 games (without extensions) and I'm wiser what satisfies me and what works with my main gaming partners/group. I will definitely keep the lighter games I own, the fit a lot of crowds. With my regulars I aim at making medium and heavy games a fix part of our game days.

I’m looking forward to playing more **Gaia Project** and **Cloudspire** from my collection. I can’t wait to play my first game of **Orleans**, **Terraforming Mars** and some incoming Kickstarters."|_patrickwelker|False|https://redd.it/eib44d|26|0.75|0|12|1|boardgames

ei8i77|2019-12-31 20:39:35|2019 in review!|"In 2019, I decided I would attempt to log all my plays of board games for the year. There were not any hard rules and I just used a simple app on my phone to keep track of things. I did not record any online/app plays, only games that I played physically with others. I am not really into solo gaming so all of these games were played with at least one other opponent. I also know some of these numbers are off by a little per human error and forgetting to record a play.

Let's start off with some basic stats:

* I played 414 times this year.
* I won 237 times this year (57%).
* I played with 13 different people this year.
* I played 163 unique games.
* I played at 9 different locations (all hotels count as 1 location, so this number should be higher).
* 73% of games were played at 2 players, 21% - 4 players, 2% - 3, 5, or 6 players
* H-Index: 8 (8 Games were played at least 8 times)

Before we get into the actual games I played, lets talk about what kind of gamer I am. My favorite mechanisms in games are going to be deck building, and worker placement. I am a sucker for new, shiny games or kickstarters. Money isn't a huge issue so if I see something I want (over-produced game with lots of minis, or out of print classic) I usually just buy it. I tend to sell games I am not into pretty quickly. I am slow to judge if a game is broken or certain strategy is over-powered BUT I'm very quick to decide if a game is for me and if I want to play it again. Without further ado, here are the games I played the most this year:  


**Aeon's End** \- 29 plays total (20x2p, 9x4p), 48% win rate - Aeon's End is a cooperative deck builder. You, as the player, are a mage fighting to protect the city of Gravehold against The Nameless (horrifying creatures from another realm). Every player has an asymmetric starting deck and a special player power. The other big twist is that you never shuffle your dek. As you are buying cards from the market they go on top of your discard, then you are free to discard the cards you played that round in any order. When it is time to draw and your deck is empty, you literally flip over your discard pile so everything stays in the exact same order. My wife and I absolutely love Aeon's End! This is by far our most played game this year. We own everything that has ever been released in this series, except for a few KS exclusive promos. We never play against a nemesis with a set plan of action/cards, we strictly use the randomizers to decide on Mages, Gems, Relics, Spells, and Nemesis. At this point we lose the majority of our games but we are never disappointed when this game hits the table.

**Agricola (Revised Ed.)** \- 17 plays total (12x2p, 1x3p, 4x4p), 76% win rate, Best Score: 49 - Agricola is a tough worker placement. You are a family of farmers in the 17th century and you are trying to get the most points over 6 rounds. As the game progresses more actions become available. I own the A, B, and C expansion decks for this game as well. I absolutely adore this game. It is a tense puzzle because with so few actions you really can't waste any time. Also the amounts of cards make for endless replayability. This game can be hard for new players to wrap their heads around, especially if playing against someone with several plays under their belt. 

**The Rise of Queensdale** \- 15 plays total (15x2p), 26% win rate - The Rise of Queensdale is a legacy game for 2-4 players. The King has decided he wants to build a town for his queen and you are a contractor in charge of a specific quadrant of this budding town. You use dice to play on action spaces. The dice have stickers that you choose on the sides so each player has specific asymmetric dice(workers) that they have upgraded for a specific strategy. This was my wife's first legacy game (mine was Pandemic Season 1). We were both engaged in the story and the decisions we had to make that we played through the 15 game campaign all in one week. Unfortunately, after the campaign it went directly in the trash. We were so burned out that we never wanted to play it again and since we had ripped up cards, destroyed pieces, and placed stickers all over the board, there was no trade or re-sell value. I can't tell you any specific details from the campaign, not because of spoilers but because none of it was memorable. 

**Heart of Crown** \- 11 plays total (10x2p, 1x4p), 45% win rate - Heart of crown is another deck building game that we played a lot this year. We found a physical copy of this game on our Honeymoon so we may view this game through rose tinted glasses. In this game you are trying to raise support for a princess so that they can become the next queen. Everyone starts out with the same deck and there is a central market that you are able to purchase cards from. The first player to back a princess and then gain 20 points wins the game. This game is a pretty average deck builder but is built around an anime aesthetic. If you like that kind of art then this game is full of it. The wife and I have a blast every time we play this game though. It is simple but also really quick and has a ton of variability. 

**On Tour** \- 10 plays total (2x2p, 3x3p,2x5p, 3x3p, 1x9p) 40% win rate - On Tour is a roll and write for 2-12 players. You are the manager of a Band and you are rolling dice and filling in states with each number rolled. At the end of the game you find your largest consecutive string of states where numbers continue to go up. This is a super simple game. I have played this game with my parents who never play games and they had no problem picking it up. This game starts off super simple but quickly becomes tense as more and more states are filled in and you run out of space or don't ever see the numbers you need to fill in your tour route. This was a kickstarter and I am so glad that I splurged for the extra player boards that allows me to play up to 12 people. My whole family had a blast playing this over the holidays. 

**Snowdonia: Deluxe Master Set -** 8 plays total (8x2p), 75% win rate - Snowdonia is a worker placement game for 1-5 players. There are several expansions that completely change up game play but keeps the original structure of the game intact. You are in a race to build a train track up a mountain with other players. There is also an event track that allows the game itself to complete certain scoring opportunities so even at two players it can be a very tight game. This is one of my favorite games of all time. I would play Snowdonia any chance I get, I just don't want my wife to get burned out on it. This is another game that has some timing intricacies that may take a few games to wrap your head around. On the outside it is a very simple worker placement but does have some deep strategy once you really get into the game. 

Runner up games that I really enjoyed but didn't get the most plays: **Welcome to..., Awkward Guests, Great Western Trail, Wingspan, Wingspan, Amerigo,** and **The Castles of Burgundy**

Games that were the biggest disappointments to me: **Welcome to Dino World, Dinosaur Island, Valda, Tzolk'in, Trajan,  The City of Kings, Museum, Crown of Emara, Trails of Tucana**

ei2muz|2019-12-31 13:06:21|Can you help with tips and advice for creating a healthy mindset towards my collection?|"This past year I implemented a new buying policy as I wanted to hold back on compulsive purchasing. Now, if I want to buy a new game, I raise at least 80% of the funds by selling old games. It's been a liberating experience and I highly recommend it for a few reasons. 

Firstly, the time it takes to sell old games (usually 1-3 weeks) gave me time to properly consider whether the investment was worth it. Secondly, it reminded me that these are just objects to be enjoyed, traded and sold as their usefulness comes and goes - if a game isn't getting played, there's no sense in keeping it. Thirdly, the changes in my collection have been exciting for me, as I'm satisfying the desire to try out new games without the guilt of a bloated collection.

The thing is (and the reason I'm asking advice) is I sometimes feel being ""the game guy"" is lose-olose.  When I'm hanging out with my friends/partner I'll usually (gently) ask if they want to play a game and they usually say no. While this is obviously completely fine, I can't help feeling somewhat crestfallen by my idle collection. When they do agree to play, I always get the sense they're just indulging me because I've been asking for a few weeks, rather than because they genuinely want to, and that feels bad too. I know it might sound childish but I honestly try hard not to have a sense of entitlement around other people wanting to do what I want to do, but I'm just so passionate about the games I own, it can feel frustrating when that passion isn't shared. I've tried two meet ups in the past and to be totally honest, it just wasn't my crowd. I'm thinking the answer is to try and become more ""zen"" about it all.

Has anyone else been through this?

The watcher’s cameras are stated to work as additional line of sights for the watcher, and in the rules it’s also stated you can fire at anything you can see. Can you fire at someone you can see through a camera? I’m not sure if it’s logical but it technically works.

ehrpty|2019-12-30 20:36:39|Who to play in Betrayal at House on the Hill if you always want to go first.|"I just got Betrayal at House on the Hill for Christmas, and one of the rules I found interesting was how to determine who goes first. In many games, the rule on who goes first is based on something personal about the players (youngest, oldest, tallest, thirstiest, etc). In Betrayal though, it's determined by the player's character whose birthday is coming up first. So if you always know which character is having their birthday next, you can *always go first*.

&nbsp;

Well good news! [I created a chart that shows exactly that.](https://imgur.com/a/V0zC8yX)

&nbsp;

Now before I made this chart, I was expecting it to be perfectly balanced where everyone has an equal chance of going first at any time of the year. But amount of time between each character's birthday is all over the place! After looking into it further, however, it seems like the number of days might actually reflect the characters' willingness to be the first to start exploring the haunted house. For example, the one with the most time is Father Rhinehardt with 56 days. With all his years of religion and wisdom, he would probably feel compelled to make the first move. That or he'd be pressured by all the younger characters to go first. On the polar end of things, Heather Granville only has 6 days in the year so she is the least likely to go first, which makes sense because she's perfect right where she is and she's not going to move a muscle until someone else moves. Another good example is Ox Bellows who has 45 days. Being the macho masculine type, of course he'd go first because he's trying to prove he's not scared of no spooky house.

&nbsp;

I'd love to know what your guys' thoughts are on these findings. I just wanted to make this chart so I can make everyone annoyed that I'm always going first, but it actually ended up showing some cool flavor to game's story!"|ebolingforsoup|False|https://redd.it/ehrpty|962|0.95|0|137|1|boardgames
ei3vjn|2019-12-31 14:59:13|[COMC] New Year, New Shelf|"https://imgur.com/a/pe4QCgw

I know there have been a lot of these lately, so forgive me, but I do enjoy these posts. 

I had started running out of space so I knew I’d be getting a new Kallax after Christmas, and then they went on sale so jumped on a 5x5. Now this is it...I won’t exceed these shelves. 

I’m trying to organize my games by categories and have shelves blend into each other. Won’t be perfect, but doing my best. For example, I have Co-ops together, which bleed into Eric Lang, which bleeds into combat games. 

**Favorite Games** - I did a “top 100 no one asked for on here” months ago, so you can search that. But I really like 2 types, economic/engine building games like Clans of Caledonia and Terraforming Mars and battle/dudes on a map games like Scythe, Blood Rage and Root


**What would I change** - depending on how expanded Champions gets, I could see myself getting rid of Marvel Legendary. Lords of Hellas is also for sale. I haven’t played it, I won it in a contest, but I just got Blood Rage and Rising Sun with Root expansion on the way, so didn’t really need another dudes on a map. Would rather have the cash. 

**Shelf of Shame** - I rarely have a shelf of shame, but with Christmas there is some
I haven’t played. Not counting Lords of Hellas, as I have no intent on keeping it. Currently I need to play **Fury of Dracula**, **The Taverns of Tiefenthal** and some expansions. I have to play **Carcassonne Inns and Cathedrals**, **Roll Player Monsters and Minions**, **Blood Rage Gods of Asgard** and **Terraforming Mars Turmoil**. The expansions won’t be an issue to play at all. Fury of Dracula will probably take some time because you probably want exactly 5 players and it takes 3 hours. I traded for it right around the time I had my daughter, so while I am able to get game nights in, it’s harder to devote to a 3 hour game."|cbjking|False|https://redd.it/ei3vjn|24|0.74|0|24|1|boardgames

At the end of January, I’m going to give a short presentation about ‘How to make enemies using classic board games’. I want it to be packed with the best and funniest examples I can find. 

We all know that certain games are not played according to the official rules. Monopoly is a prime example. And some of these games don’t have the most balanced rules to begin with. 

I’m trying to compile a list of games:
- That a lot of people would know. The target audience is software developers, so it’s OK if your grandma hasn’t heard of it.
- That have exploitable rules most people don’t know about.
- Where exploiting those rules would ruin things for everyone at the table.

I’ve already got a few:
- Monopoly (hoard houses, never build hotels)
- Scrabble (play non-existing words, make others challenge you and lose turns when they do exist)
- Magic the Gathering: tear up a Chaos Orb and sprinkle it on your opponent’s cards.

But I could use some more, so I call on your collective wisdom for ideas.

Edit: Thanks so much for all this input. The talk is going to be amazing. If you’re in London on the 31st of January, feel free to come to [PubConf](https://pubconf.io/events/2020/london/) and watch it live.

ei9056|2019-12-31 21:19:07|New to deck building - questions|"Me and my brothers recently started getting into deck building games. Two of have tried them here and there, but my brother recently bought one so now we’re getting excited about it.   
  
Oddly enough the one we have is called like “cartoon crossover” it’s the Cartoon Network version of these games. We have both editions.   
  
What I don’t get is that we’ve played it three times and mostly we haven’t got a strategy going. Once my brothers friend did, but he’s experienced and honestly might’ve fudged or misunderstood some rules.   
  
  
Basically, it’s fun but kind of lame trying to build your deck, not getting a chance at good cards that come up between your turns, and then having like two half built decks by the time the game ends. (This game ends when a certain “nemesis” deck runs  out, idk how common that mechanic is.).  
  
My question is if there’s a way to improve this, or maybe if it just comes with experience?   
  
Idk if the games too short or if were bad at it, but I’ll gun for cards I can string together and end up with less than I wanted buried in my deck, either not used at all or not used together.
  
  
(Most cards don’t allow for thinning of the deck, but were staring to get that the cards that do are really good.)   
  
Sorry if this question is so simple it’s stupid, or if I’m otherwise misunderstanding something basic. Just trying to have a little more fun with a brand new type of game."|Bushidough|False|https://redd.it/ei9056|7|0.78|0|19|1|boardgames

For the entire game you are allowed to discuss about the cards, you can guess wrong multiple times and still get to the end. Then at the end if you didn't get far in the intuition track, you're supposed to figure out the right combo based on a single card and you're not allowed to talk. Even if you get two or even three cards, it may still be hard to interpret when you have multiple suspects. Like 2/3 of the game is a fun cooperative game, then the last third may just be a gamble.

This seems to be handled much better in Deception because at the start of the game you have one murderer, one murder weapon and one piece of evidence and the whole game is spent discussing about them based on the clues with no extra fiddliness."|Charming_Load|False|https://redd.it/eib54g|5|0.58|0|16|1|boardgames

I just looked in the rules to get details on a step just to learn whoever taught me to play last year did it horribly wrong. Like, it’s the same general idea with the same elements, but very different method that probably makes the game play out very differently. Like the rules went through a game of telephone first. Now I’ve taught the game to a few groups. Oh god it’s spreading. 

Anyway the way I played it : each round you would guess the opposing team’s words instead of just the code numbers. Also the game played in parallel, with both teams doing their answers, then swapping the clues, then discussing opponent’s clues, then guessing words for a point. 

We then realized the metagame is completely changed. In the real version your clues have to be very different so they don’t match up similar clues to the same numbers. In this weird version, just lead them down the wrong path with similar but unhelpful clues, and they never can guess the exact word. 

That makes the game sound impossible, to guess the exact word, but people ended up doing it and winning. Shrug. 

Anyway, that’s just another lesson to never let random people teach you a game. Funny how it still sounds the same for the most part. I posted a thread last week and gave Decrypto a basic summary and it’s still valid for both versions.

eib1ud|2020-01-01 00:04:06|Game Of Thrones Risk Modification For Longer Games (With More Strategy Involved) And Bonus Optional Rules|"So I've been playing this one game of GoT Risk with my family (5 Players) for just about 12-13 hours now. It's taken the span of one week because we changed the following rules:

1. No Victory Points. We were playing Total World (Westeros) Domination. When you complete an objective at the end of your turn, you must control your seat of power, and on the next turn, you will receive that many troops and gold on your next turn. For example, if you complete an objective for 3 VPs, on your next turn you receive an extra 3 armies and 300 gold. We also took out the Valar Morghulis/Valar Dohaeris territory card that ends the game. This makes it so the only way to win is to take over the entire world.
2. The ""Unplanned Losses"" maester card which makes one enemy lose a VP can be either thrown out or repurposed. We had the idea to change the card to something similar to ""Winter Is Coming,"" but it would instead affect special units. Every opponent would be forced to discard one of their special units (in turn order) and then the one who played the card must discard one of their special units. (This can be any maester card you and your party decide it to be)

OPTIONAL EXTRA RULES FOR EVERY GAME

1. The ""Blood Magic"" maester card can kill a character if a 3 or higher is rolled on a d6, OR revive a character if a 3 or higher is rolled on a d6. This seems like a fairly small change that will make the game more balanced and not totally devastate a player's chances of winning if their best character is killed.
2. A small buff to Tyrion Lannister. The character currently allows you to look at the top 2 maester cards, choose one, and discard the other for an extra 100 gold (300 total gold). The change would allow you to, after looking at the top two maester cards, buy both if you so choose for an extra 200 gold on top of the 100 for Tyrion (500 gold total). This is a useful but small buff to Tyrion, but I would not totally recommend it as the Lannisters are already very powerful because of Cersei.
3. A maester card that can destroy special units. I don't know exactly how this could be implemented. Maybe the ""Add a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ special unit"" maester cards can also destroy special units, but it is really up to you and your party. This can be helpful because as it stands, special units can become extremely broken if used properly.

In this multiple-day game I've been playing, there are now three players left: me, my brother, and my dad. My brother pretty much lost after attacking himself out and paying for it. He has now moved all his troops and all his special units to one territory after going on a rampage and killing 20 armies while only losing 2. He has about 15 troops so far on his one territory, as well as 4 fortifications, 2 siege machines, and 3 knights. This means, on defense, he has 2 d8s to roll, with a +7 to his highest die and +4 to the other. Without any special units on offense, that is literally invincible.

This appears to be a very good strategy. It will not matter if he loses all of his other territories, because he will never lose his one big territory. He can also very easily take any territory (as long as it has no special units) to get a territory card for even more special units. Since I have Cersei, I plan to get as many special units as I can and do something similar, but try to hold the Iron Islands for the bonus army at the start of my turn If I can activate Cersei on every turn I will eventually be able to beat him.

I suspect overall the game will end up taking many more hours, but we have the time. This modification to the game allows for very fun, very long games. The mod is also very strategic, as long as you make it hard to do what my brother has done and survive with only one territory.

I hope you enjoy playing this modification, leave comments if you have any other rules you think would make a good mod."|evandworkin|False|https://redd.it/eib1ud|2|0.5|0|3|1|boardgames

Joker and Harley Quinn work really well together, but the items are a little unbalanced and Batman and Batgirl don't have any combo moves that really stand out. Even with these negatives, it didnt detract from the game and the advantages weren't too powerful.

 I plan to buy the explansions and hope it gets a larger following."|Lady_Monarch|False|https://redd.it/ehzxkk|16|0.73|0|11|1|boardgames

**Parts Department** : 23 (1 more)  

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**  
  
Around 16 years, since early 2004.  
  
**What would you change about your collection if you could?**   
  
I am long overdue for a cull and reduction. I still enjoy the treasure hunt of thrifting, and I have found a couple of great items even within the last month (a Nova Axis & Allies in fantastic condition, and Star Wars Epic Duels, both for crazy cheap) but I also need an outlet to sell / move off of many of the things I have.  

I had a real downturn in game-playing in 2019. Part of this is positive, as my wife and I enjoyed a lot more time with our two-year-old who spent this year being very active and rambunctious. The good news is that he started playing games this year, but the less-good news is that we really only played Go Away Monster. But, I have those 40+ games waiting in the wings, and he will be aging up into the range to play them within the next couple of years.  
  
But, the negative of 2019 is that I did not get much casual play in, other than at organized events (e.g. Geekway to the West, and some dedicated gaming weekends). I know that buying games is not buying the time to play them, and I know that I am holding on to some games well beyond their usefulness, possibility to get played, and shelf-life. On the last topic, I played a couple of games this year and last year that I have had since 2005 or so, and I would have been better served to play them a long time ago and be rid of them than I have been to hold on to them for so long waiting for the ""right"" time. I am going to try to be mindful of that in 2020 and use that as a basis to fire-sale several items.  
  
**What is your favorite game you own?**  
  
Regardless of its impracticality, Turfmaster. It is best with 8 players, which is a thing I will nearly never get, and one of my best gaming friends absolutely hates it, so I'm not going to get him to play it. But, I love the game.
   
**What is your newest game?**  
  
I just picked up Knizia's L.L.A.M.A. card game. It is a fast and fun filler.  
  
**Games looking forward to adding? Wantlist?**  
I am almost to the point of not having a wantlist anymore. Almost all of my game purchases in 2019 were purchases of opportunity, either through thrifting, browsing at a game store, or in a convention flea markert and virtual flea market. I don't have a plan or design to get any new games right now, though I will consider something if recommended by a friend. I bought L.L.A.M.A. after playing with some gaming friends, and I saw it as a light game I could play at work or with family."|skelebone|False|https://redd.it/ehs22z|82|0.87|0|36|1|boardgames

How my collection has changed from 2018 to 2019 


Culled games 

Scythe  - fell flat for us , maybe it plays better at 3-4 players but since we mostly play 2 player it didn’t interest us at all 

Quest for el dorado- liked it very much for the racing element but the deck building is not that great with only a few cards being picked all the time ( also the size of the cards is very very annoying )

Mansions of madness 2nd ed - played just  3 out of the base scenarios and didn’t enjoy it . The story didn’t intrigue us and just monsters popping here and there didn’t interest us. Neither me or wife has played or are interested in D&D so maybe 

Dominion - our starting deck builder now replaced by clank and GWT

voyages of Marco Polo - sold unplayed as I heard about Marco Polo 2 coming so thought will buy that 

Dice forge - really liked it but ended so quickly and very few card options

Century golem edition : liked the first few plays but the game didn’t have much to offer after few plays 

2019 additions : everdell , brass : Birmingham , Gaia project , Troyes , clank ! , great western trail , chronicles of crime , sushi go , spirit island , Azul , pandemic legacy s1 and s2, Orleans , architects of west kingdom , teotihuacan , Wingspan

ehntbq|2019-12-30 16:01:37|A beautiful introduction to 7 Wonders|"I want to share with you (and record outside my own fragile brain) a recounting of an exceptionally lovely game. It occurred just after Thanksgiving this year.

My father had suffered a brain injury. His doctors were trying to determine the extent of the neurological damage. I had flown in to see him in the hospital, and my brother had come to town for the same reason. We were staying at my parents’ house, ferrying back and forth to the hospital with my mother. The initial prognosis wasn't good. We were weary and dispirited. 

My brother mentioned that a couple of friends were also at their parents’ house the next town over. Another pair of brothers. Coincidentally, their father had suffered a stroke.  We had known each other in childhood, our families celebrating holidays and special occasions together. He suggested we get together while we were all in town.

In my rush to catch a last-minute flight, I had left home without any games. I would ordinarily have something in a small box, good for travel, maybe **Mint Works** or **Innovation** or **Oh My Goods**. But I had nothing. 

I realized it was Black Friday. I usually avoid that crush of retail madness, but this wasn’t a usual year. I asked my mother if she’d take me to Target before visiting hours at the hospital. They had **7 Wonders** on sale for $20 off. I had never played the game, but I'd long heard great things about it. It seemed like a reasonable choice for this audience – non-gamers, but very smart. I had to ask a Target employee to get me a copy from the back of the store. I crossed my fingers that the choice would be a good one. Should I have gone with something lighter, like **Sushi Go**?

That evening, the younger of our friends took a bit of convincing. He wasn't sure he would enjoy playing a game, but agreed reluctantly. My mother decided to join us. I queued up [Rodney Smith's 7 Wonders instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_Wfdn5Es8U) (now seven years old) on my parents' iMac for the group to watch. There was a bit of groaning when the video's duration was discovered to be a full 30 minutes, but the group persevered.  

We finally started playing. Slowly, we passed around hands of cards, asking questions aloud about what we were seeing. As the iconography became familiar, the gameplay accelerated, and our worries faded into the background. We opened a bottle of armagnac. 

At the end of the first age, no one had built any military, so no one took any victories or losses. The friend with the PhD. had started amassing science cards – very on-brand, as my brother pointed out. 

The game gained momentum. Everyone was engrossed. I started building up my military, while my brother (sitting to my right) found a card that gave him victory points for his neighbors’ militaries. We cheered as my mom placed a high-value monument. The game was everything. For that brief span of time, nothing else existed. No hospitals. No neurological assessments. No mortality.

The armagnac came to an end at about the same time as the game. My brother took charge of tallying up the points. After he went around the table, the results showed I won by one point! A good teacher of a game shouldn't be the winner, but I granted myself an excuse because I wasn't really the teacher. I had never played before, and learned from Rodney at the same time as everyone else. 

The most important thing was that everyone had a wonderful time. The friend who had been skeptical said he was very glad that he had agreed to play. We sat around and had a postmortem of everyone’s strategies. 

I can't tell you that the phone rang and it was the hospital, telling us both fathers had recovered suddenly and miraculously. I can't tell you that the next morning, everything wasn't exactly the same as it had been. But just for that evening, we had a merciful, bright, joyful oasis. **7 Wonders** is a brilliant game, and I can't imagine a better introduction to it."|BurningSpork|False|https://redd.it/ehntbq|188|0.91|0|13|1|boardgames

As a playgroup, we have collected hundreds of board games over the years that all stay at his house.  We have even customized storage for the ones we play most often, with some broken token inserts and such. 

So I am kinda looking for an out of the box idea on something that could improve our gaming experience that he doesnt already have, outside of just buy yet another game.  

I was thinking about an over-sized table play-mat that covers the whole table, rather than just using individual play-mats like we do now.  Unfortunately, most of them are pretty plain and I havent seen any with staiin resist or anything to protect against the occasional drink spill (if such a mat exists).  

So anyways, I thought I would ask the community if they had any ideas or maybe some cool things I havent seen or heard about. 

*Also, budget isnt too big an issue since I dont mind spending a couple hundred dollars on something we will all use, but a multi thousand dollar custom gaming table is probably off the table as well.*"|NudePenguin69|False|https://redd.it/ehwcfu|19|0.92|0|18|1|boardgames

As a Christmas present to myself I rearranged my room and now all my games are neatly on my shelves I thought I'd share! There are a few games that you can't quite see in the pic - Formula D on the bottom left of the middle shelf; and A Cruel Necessity, Pandemic, and Dominion on the left of the top shelf, with Jaws underneath Horrified.

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

Since as long as I can remember. I was playing D&D with friends before the age of 9, but one pivotal moment that probably turned me into an actual hobbyist was picking up White Dwarf issue 104, in 1988, when I was 12. After that I spent my school years playing Games Workshop stuff; and then at university I got into Magic, Jyhad, and a bunch of other stuff. After graduating boardgames gave way to videogames, but I recently got back into boardgaming just because.

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

There would be a lot more games in it for a start. This collection has been amassed over the past couple of years - all of my old games are back in my parents' loft on the other side of the planet. And every new addition has been brought in kicking and screaming against my wife's complaints that we don't have enough room in the house to keep them. I probably wouldn't have bothered with the 7th Continent if I had played it before buying it; Gloomhaven might not have been bought if I had known it would simply be unplayable, logistically. Still waiting for the day to move on to the second scenario.

**What is your favorite game you own?**

I really love Star Wars Rebellion. And would really love to try Fumie no Tame, but I'm waiting for the right person to play it with me (must be able to read Japanese; must be interested in actually playing it, unlike my wife who rolled her eyes and gave up after I dealt our hands). 

**What is your newest game?**

ei1b9t|2019-12-31 10:40:26|How to start to hate your favorite game (for 2 years)|"I want to tell you my story, and maybe it will stop you from making the same mistake.

I like to play board games. I played more than 100 different ones with different game mechanics,  so I could classify myself as a “boardgames experienced player”. My top 1 of favorite 1-1 games is Tash-Kalar. If you tried it you can understand why. You don’t have to play hundreds of games to get pretty high game level. And it always is a huge fun to find proper patterns to summon a new being, and prepare this patterns for the next turn.

As a bonus for me my good friend also enjoyed it a lot. We were playing and discussing games together and soon we became top-2 and top-3 players on BGA. It was about 2-3 years ago. Top-1 was taken by *VortexSurfer*. The problem was that we weren’t able to find him to beat from this position, but somehow we did it and we got top-1 and top-2 position for some period of time.

The problem here, that there were no strong players to play with. Except us, there were about 2-3 players whom it was interesting to play with. But because of small amount of good players me and my friend mostly just played together. My friend didn’t like “turn-based” mode, because his goal was to finish any game as soon as possible and not in 2-3 days.

And here is the story begins...  
I suggested to open 3-5 tables of “turn-based” mode so we can think about multiple actions.  
He started joking like: “Why not to open 10?”. So we opened 10. And I decided to continue joke to increase amount of tables to 20. And after that joke went out of control. There we decided, like, why not to open 100 tables? And we did it.   
So we had **100 (!)** games of Tash-Kalar playing in parallel.

We had been playing for about 1-2 weeks before we finished everything. Final score was pretty close. I won with something like: 53 vs 47. But after that I was so overloaded with Tash-Kalar, so I stopped playing for 2 years.  
It was a huge mistake to start such session, because during this session there was no pleasure. Imagine that you need to make place a common piece 100 times on nearly empty board.

So what I am doing now.  
I can again enjoy playing Tash-Kalar, so I started to play again, and I can see that 2 years later, people started to play much better. Now almost any “expert” (BGA rank) is good enough and you have to try hard to win. I am going to post some interesting puzzles/game situations/tips&tricks or whatever in this subreddit (you can check my profile, I already have couple of them posted). The goal is to increase amount of people who can be interested in this game. I started streaming on twitch Tash-Kalar games, hoping that this will help too (originally not only for Tash-Kalar but for any board games, that I like. For now I was only playing Tash-Kalar). I hope that one day this game would be popular enough to have a lot of offline championships. And I hope that soon we will have CGE app to play online with all available expansions.

Generally I have more unplayed games than played for the year partly because I see an interesting game that the group would enjoy but we only get around to playing one or two games of the several I buy. I also play role playing games so there's a bit of competition over available time and my group is also my band so half the time each week is practicing songs :) 

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

Well, I'm 62 now and I've been playing since I was a kid with Battleship, Monopoly, and other such games. I started war gaming back in the late 60's and have been gaming ever since. On one occasion I was tempted to purge what I had but the offer was far below what I thought I should have received so I backed out. I've not regretted the decision and am proud to say I have all the games I've ever purchased since those first war games. **So how long?** Let's pick 1967 as an arbitrary date, when I was 10, and say 52 years.

**What are your top 10 favorite board games over the past 52 years?**

I had to trim it down a little as there are probably another 10 or so that are in the list of games I really enjoy playing. Some I haven't played in decades just because it's difficult to find folks willing to play the old war games :) 

* **Bunny Kingdom**
* **Car Wars**
* **Castles of Burgundy**
* **Cosmic Encounter**
* **Nuclear War**
* **Pandemic**
* **Richthofen's War**
* **Snit's Revenge**
* **Wings of War**
* **Wooden Ships & Iron Men**

**Favorite board game of the past year?**

Probably **Wingspan**. We've played several games from past years that we've enjoyed like **Bunny Kingdom** and **The Doom That Came To Atlantic City** but for a new this year game, we've played **Wingspan** several times with Jeanne and with friends.

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

Not a thing. Yes, I have lots of games. Yes, many haven't been played for one reason or another. I've read posts from various folks over the years who've bemoaned selling off some game or another.

Recently my wife and I headed over to a friend's house and we brought a few games including **Nuclear War** and of the games we brought, we played **Nuclear War** most often. Plus when we got home, my 36yo daughter asked, ""is that the same game we played when I was a kid? Can we play it now?"" :) 

**What is your most prized possession?**

Probably my **Ace of Aces Collector's Edition** or my **Wings of War** Richthofen's miniature. I do have lots of bits from conventions and such but those are more related to my Role Playing side than board gaming."|HayabusaJack|False|https://redd.it/ehpe0w|22|0.79|0|7|1|boardgames

ehvt0o|2019-12-31 01:40:40|Replacement components? (7 Wonders)|"Well, it happened. After 50+ plays, unrecoverable component damage. Took out 7 Wonders to play a couple nights ago, noticed two age II cards stuck together. Like, really stuck. No evidence of gummy adhesion, looked more like they’d somehow gotten wet, stuck to each other, and been put back into the box to dry into a single, inseparable card. An attempt to steam them apart was unsuccessful; patients died on the operating table.

Not clear who is responsible, but almost certainly one of my son’s friends. He’s usually quite careful with my/our games, and grimly acknowledged that one of his buddies is likely at fault. No way of knowing which one, though. 

Both cards are part of the 4+ group, with no other copies at higher player counts, so game is basically unplayable with more than 3. Sigh. 

A quick check of the Asmodee North site suggests that I am SOL, that they don’t replace damaged components. (Ah, for the pre-merger days, when Z-Man kindly replaced a trio of my damaged Pandemic cards, gratis.) Has anyone had any luck with Asmodee service on damaged components? Any chance that they’re cooler than their stated policy suggests?

Failing that, anyone have a lead on spare 7W parts/cards? When your game (7W or something else) has had a damaged unique component, what workarounds have you found, short of buying a whole new game?"|loopster70|False|https://redd.it/ehvt0o|6|0.7|0|4|1|boardgames

ehppv2|2019-12-30 18:18:27|[COMC] Games by Colour & My History of Gaming|"With the new house, I thought it'd be fun to make the board games look aesthetically pleasing and decided to arrange them (along with our books) in a way that makes it difficult to find but pretty.

[COMC](https://imgur.com/uw6gMuZ)

I am **super** strict on my own collection - I only keep games that I enjoy and that gets played. I can pretty confidently say if we haven't played a game in about 6 months, it will leave my collection as I don't have the space (nor do I want) to keep them. I also will play games I own within a week and I've never had more than 1 unplayed game. As an aside, the Galaxy Truckers copy was mine but sold to a friend in the friend group - it's just been living at my house recently.

&#x200B;

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

I am one of those people who started off with Monopoly and absolutely *loved* it to bits. While a lot of people hate that the game never ends, we house-ruled it to bits as middle-schoolers and loved our 1am-7am Monopoly sleepovers. These were very much formative board game nights with friends I will remember for the rest of my life. In high school I dabbled in some MTG, but only very lightly and it wasn't until university that I really hit my board game stride.

When I got to university in 2010, my boyfriend at the time got me into playing Magic a lot more frequently - tons of FNM, drafts, and even listening to podcasts I was very much not interested in. One of the times we were at a game store picking up Magic cards, I thought it'd be cool to pick up Caverna literally because of the wooden animals - which became my first 'gateway' into this whole world. My collection was quite tiny, and I can't even really tell you how many games were in my collection from 2010-2017 - somewhere around 10 games, ranging from Catan to Machi Koro to Dominion.

***2017***

This was when I really had the time to explore BGG and that changed everything. I also really found a huge, huge love for Eurogames. I bought 26 games over the year (sold 10 of them by the end of the year). I was interested in trying a lot of things, and found there were things I didn't care to keep in my collection. A group of my university friends were meeting every single week on Fridays for board games and it really became an on-going habit to meet every Friday evening for games. That year we logged 265 plays of games.

***2018***

By 2018 I was head over heels into the hobby. I even ended up working at a game store for a while which meant games were easier than ever to pick up with my employee discount. I had the ability to read rulebooks while on breaks, went on BGG to find out information for customers who visited the store, playing mini solo games during lunch (Friday & Hostage Negotiator were my favourites), and I was able to buy games literally the day they came out. That year I bought 29 base games, 3 expansions, and resold 11 - a net of 18 games/expansions.

The game group was still going strong and we met up more than ever, logging in a whopping **427** games that year. A few new members were added to the game group and we were actually able to split the group into player two different games at times. Every Friday we played euros - and that's not to say we never tried Ameri-thrash games - there is a very healthy board game community in the city and we've stopped by game cafes to try a few but the group just never felt the same with those games as we did for euros. This was a glorious time of games and friendships and that was definitely a year that forged all of our love for board gaming.

I also got into solo gaming this year and did a very ambitious 10x10 which included games like The Gallerist and Anachony - there was a lot of solo plays in December to make up the 10x10 but I did it!

***2019***

I'd like to say that we managed to play even more than last year but to be honest, this was probably the first year that we missed a bunch of gaming Fridays due to the fact that parts of the group moved outside of the big city for work, a destination wedding within the friend group (so many people were busy), and the host (myself) made a big move which means a few Fridays got relegated to packing and unpacking. This year, we logged **367** games.

I was also stricter than ever on my collection and while I still bought 20 games over the course of the year, I sold **16** games which meant overall my collection only grew by 4 games (in comparison to 18 the year before!).

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

There are still some games I am thinking of letting go - right now, Dinosaur Island and 5-Minute-Dungeon. For both of them, while I enjoy them, I just don't feel like I get enough plays and there are small things that bother me with each of them. Dinosaur Island in particular I am very stuck on - I absolutely love the art and the theme and I even enjoy the gameplay quite a bit - but... it takes up so much space and we don't get to play it very often. Overall though, I am very happy with my collection and the new arrangement makes me smile.

&#x200B;

**What is your favourite game you own?**

My favourite game of all time is The Gallerist and in general I love Vital's other offerings too. A very very close second though is Trickerion. From there we have Yokohama (which I don't even own), Anachrony, Vinhos.

[Top 15 in 2019](https://imgur.com/5Knlru1)

**What's Next**

On the way from Kickstarter, I'm waiting for On Mars (which combines my favorite designer and my absolutely favourite theme - MARS!!). The Anachrony expansion is also on it's way which I'm excited for as the current box is pretty jammed packed. However, I am most excited for the [BoardGameTables.com](https://BoardGameTables.com) Jasper which should be shipping sometime next month!

2019 was quite a year for my board gaming hobby. I purchased the Jasper Kickstarter table and chairs, and acquired a game or \~20 as the year went on. Played a ton of the EXIT games with my wife who's not huge into the hobby and finished Pandemic Legacy Season 1 which was absolutely incredible and will be starting season 2 in Jan. According to BGG Stats app I logged 121 ""plays"" which I'm pretty happy with.

The new games I added to my collection in 19 were: All of the EXIT series, Great Western Trail, Viticulture, Spririt Island, INIS, Pandemic Legacy 1 & 2, Betrayal Legacy, Between Two Cities, TM: Turmoil, Tiny Towns, Jaipur, Stone Age, The Chameleon, Chinatown, Century Spice Road: Golem edition, Pandemic: On The Brink, Chronicles of Crime, Catch the Moon, Captain Sonar, Champions of Midgaard, CoM: Valhalla, and a few other escape type games. Rather than blaming my lack of self control I blame all of you for introducing me to all of these games!

Favorite three games:Terraforming mars - I know it's somewhat of a hot take on this sub but I adore the game.GWT - Only game in my collection that I'd play any time day or night.Viticulture - Nice worker placement that's not as unforgiving as Terra Mystica.

Shelf of shame: Quite a few. I've not played about six of the games on my shelf but four of the games are from Christmas so I anticipate I'll play them soon.

Wish List: Right now I'm pretty set and not dying to get any new games. Wingspan at some point when everyone relaxes a little would go well with my collection.

Would love discuss anything about the collection or hobby in general! Also, looking for advice on how to better sort my shelves.  Cheers to 2020!

Good idea? or you think they may read my eyes.
2. If you cant make any connection with a dream card is it a legit strategy jut to give one player all your dream cards so you can get a fresh hand? is there a card limit on how much you can give one player?
3. How are they suppose to cast their votes ? I know they are not suppose to discuss with each other. Are the other players suppose to see the casted vote or should i put all the votes in a bag and reveal at the end?

ehn9yk|2019-12-30 15:19:59|Android boardgames that work well on Android TV or other tv device|"Very specific question but this feels like something with huge potential. This is my experience so far:

**Ticket To Ride**: Looks and works great, but is kind of pointless as a communal experience cause everyone would see your cards.

**Istanbul**: a great game that works pretty much perfectly for this usage, as there is no hidden info and pass and play works with a communal display. Seeing the game on the big screen and the music makes its a fun experience.

**Pandemic**: Something is up with the way this game is coded because all the menu text appears absolutely microscopic on the screen, I'm talking about completely illegible and therefore the game is essentially unplayable. A real shame because it's another game that would lend itself to this format: big communal map, no hidden info to hide from other players

**7 wonders duel**: Could not get this game to install for the life of me, another one that should lend itself to this.

Update 12/31/19

**Castles of Mad King Ludwig**: Works great on an android TV device! Absolutely addicting game too, loving this one. I would firmly put this game in the ""too complicated to score IRL, perfect to play as an automated app version"" category. I don't know if I ever would have successfully played this on an actual table. As far as I know, there is very little if any info you hide from your opponent so maybe a good candidate for pass-the-keyboard communal display play (new term?)

**Castles of Burgundy**: Works great on an Android TV device! Another game which reallllly shines as an app cause sooo much goes on with each action, it seems like setting up and scoring and reacting to each move would be a nightmare irl, but as an app is a breeze and extremely fun. I haven't won a game yet but im really loving it. Looks great on a big TV, lots of stuff on screen that you can see better on a big display. Also no hidden info in this game so perfect for ptk (pass the keyboard, my new term for a game you can play on one communal display and passing the controls for each term)

**Galaxy Truckers**: This came highly recommended from alot of people, including in this thread. One huuuuge caveat: This came is portrait mode only! If you play it on your phone, youll see that it doesnt rotate. So on a widescreen TV display a huge chunk of everything was cut off. I found a solution for it, not totally ideal, look below at the tips section. I didn't get past the tutorial yet but it seems like it could certainly be a fun game.

**Basebal Highlights 2045**: Some people recommended this, works fine on an Android TV device, though its not a very good looking game, graphics arent great and the cards are heard to read even on a big display. Also don't quite get how this game works and didn't seem all that fun but I'll keep trying.

**Through the Ages**: Happy to report that this game looks great on my Android TV device, reallllly benefits from the huge screen, lots going on. Played the tutorial but honestly eventually this game went over my head. The tutorial is really long but i think I may have to do it again cause honestly I missed some key parts I think. Either way, looked and played great on my device. Can't comment yet on the PTK ability as I havent played an actual game yet but either way, it works.




*General tips:* 



You absolutely need a mouse (and probably a keyboard) to play any of these games, none of them are controller supported

Besides **Ticket to Ride**, none of these apps are officially supported Android TV apps, therefore they don't appear in the play store on an Android TV device. I had to sideload the rest. 

Since starting this thread, I started messing around with trying to improve the compatibility of some of the games that have problems. If you'll recall, **Pandemic** will not display text in any legible way, and **Galaxy Truckers** is portrait only, so it gets all cut off on a TV.  To do this I downloaded the app Screen Shift ([google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sagar.screenshift2&hl=en_US)), which is ROOT ONLY. If your device isn't rooted, this app is irrelevant. Anyways, it lets you mess around quite a bit with the resolution, overscan, and DPI of your display. Long story short, nothing i did to **Pandemic** could get it to work, but I could see an app-specific profile to change the resolution to a portrait mode style res whenever i launch **Galaxy Truckers** so that it displays properly. You lose alot of screen real estate this way, to the point where it almost maybe isn't worthwhile, but just reporting on how I was able to get it to work.

Still have not found anyway to even sideload **7 Woners Duel**, my device seems to not be able to ""parse"" the file (which is purchased from google play on my phone). Sidenote, i learned that despite the fact that I bought 7W Duel on my phone, my tablet with the same account still shows it as having to be paid for, I am not entitled to download it on my other device.


Also for the curious, my Android TV device is actually a Xiaomi Laser Projector (ultra short throw) which runs on Android 6, so I'm playing these on a huge 110"" screen. Its not *officially* an Android TV device but its been rooted and modified to basically mimic it in every way, including the app store, so I can only get androidTV apps from the play store on the device itself.

Anyone have any suggestions or experiences with this? Any ideas? I'd like to update this thread regularly as a repository for info on this very specific but I think highly fun usage of Android Board Game apps."|servo386|False|https://redd.it/ehn9yk|15|0.78|0|6|1|boardgames

ehkqtp|2019-12-30 11:02:19|Situation regarding changing your play during a game. Opinions?|"I wanted opinions on a situation that happened. I don't plan to bring the issue up again because I value the friendship/relationship over board games. But I would also like to know if I am in wrong for future plays and if was wrong i want to apologise .

I was playing Villainous with a group of friends. Sam played a card against John and after saying where he was playing it, but before anything else happened, he changed his mind and wanted to move it. John said he couldn't because he already played it and it stayed where he originally played it. Later in the game Sam did the same to me. And when I said he couldn't move the card because he played it John stepped in and told me Sam could change it. For context, it was obvious I would win in 2 turns if the card stayed in the original place. An argument happened, I finally dropped it, apologized for the tension and left the card in the original play.

Later we were playing Betrayal and I dropped an item card, another player said I misunderstood it so I started to pick it up. John stepped in and said I couldn't change the play because I already dropped it and since his turn was next was picking it up. I started to argue again and then stopped and said I didn't want it to turn into Villainous and dropped the item card again. At that point John said ""no, keep the card, I just play to be a jerk"". I ended up taking the card out of play completely because I felt awkward and didn't know what to do.

So my questions are:
1. What do you think of the situation? Was John correct in his decisions? I felt he kept changing the rule to work in his favor, but my judgement could be clouded.

2. Do you think someone should be allowed to change a card placement/play if game play has not moved forward at all?

I usually just go with however the group plays but have also never had dissagrements on this. And I admittedly got a little upset about the situation but am wondering if I was wrong. I feel bad for starting the tension but also don't feel it was fair. Thank you for reading and I hope everything made sense."|Mother-Helicopter|False|https://redd.it/ehkqtp|21|0.84|0|27|1|boardgames
ehongp|2019-12-30 17:03:14|Human punishment Boss card clarification|"Hey , recently played human punishment and the Human Boss program came up . 
It is a 3 card boss that when revealed it prevents certain loyalties from equipping cerian weapons .(Outlaws may no longer equip the rifle) 
Now we fell into debate about how this card is intended to be used. 

I knew one player was an outlaw but not all of their loyalty cards had been revealed to other players . Plus they claimed to have loyalty switching programs that no longer made them an outlaw.  (This was in fact not true) 

Due to the encouraged lying in the game how is this card intended to be used ? 


I had a theory : it's more about exposing loyalty than preventing the equipping of a weapon.  And the ""rule"" it enacts is to be followed strictly by effected players who are or become outlaws or machines after it is played.  It is now their job to conceal their loyalty without using the unequippable weapons. 
If they ""lie"" about being able to equip the weapon they are in fact breaking the game. 

Thoughts please.

ehi2ta|2019-12-30 05:59:18|"A Defense of Kingmaking, ""Part II"" - Cole Wehrle (from a BGG Oath Designer Diary)"|"Background links:

[His original talk at GDC:  'King Me:  A Defense of Kingmaking in Game Design](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025683/Board-Game-Design-Day-King)

[His most recent Design Diary ""Destinations and Paths"", the third in detailing the victory conditions for Oath](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2335197/designer-diary-8-destinations-and-paths-victory-pa)

Great diary as always (including a die roll to end the game!!) but I'll paste the relevant part as background for this post:

> Oath's victory condition is one of my favorite parts of the design and one of the parts of the design that has been the most stable over the course of its development. I mean the condition to be an affectionate critique of **Root**'s victory condition and of the victory calculus associated with regime control in Pax games.

> In both cases my intervention was made possible because of Oath's ability to tell stories over the course of many games. Essentially, the four visions in Oath are a little like the four regimes of **Pax Porfiriana** or the four victory conditions in **Pax Renaissance**. However, because only one is the primary goal each game, the ground for determining victory is dramatically more stable. Essentially, Oath is attempting to make these bigger narratives more accessible by allowing their action to unfold over several games.

> At the same time, Oath is not a slow game or a simple one. While it's possible for players to occasionally coast to a win in Root, in Oath you need to be aggressive. Games often end with one player snatching the brass ring.

> In order to structure victory in this way, the design has had to court interaction, interdependence, and risk more forcefully than many of my previous games. But here again these elements gelled well with Oath's multi-generational structure. Most games of Oath are won through skill. There's a lot of texture to every decision you make in the game and the game has a surprisingly long strategic horizon that rewards planning. At the same time, sometimes a lucky player wins. Opportunities for kingmaking abound.

Naturally, someone responded with some (optimistic) skepticism for kingmaking:

> My first thought upon reading this is ""yuck!"" But you present it as a feature of the game, rather than as a defect. Can you say more about why you think kingmaking is a good thing?

And Cole's thought provoking response:

> First, I just want prospective players to know what they are getting into. Oath is an interactive game, in some respects more interactive than Root. This means if players want to pile up on another player, the game isn't going to stop them. That level of interaction produces the potential for kingmaking.

> But I don't think that's a strictly bad thing. Here's why.

> In most games victory is a purely judgmental affair. I played better than you, and I won. Oath is certainly like this too. Though there are agents of chaos in the game, mostly the better players wins.

> However, because games of Oath are linked, the results of a game of Oath are not merely judgmental, they are consequential as well. How a particular player wins matters almost as much as who won.

> This does some strange and I think deeply thematically resonate things to the end game. In most cases players will still strive to win the game and will be afforded lots of opportunities for hail-Mary plays and upset wins. But, the classic kingmaking problem still comes up every once in awhile. That is, a non-winning player must choose to either help a player or, by their inaction, help a second player. In either case they have lost the game.

> Mostly these choices form part of the strategic texture for most interactive games. The trick is just figuring out how to set yourself in a position where someone else makes you king.

> But, in Oath, these two choices do not have the same outcome. While the choosing player will lose the game in either way, the consequence of their choice can be quite profound. If player A is helped, the kingdom might fall to ruin. If player B is helped, the regime will continue to entrench itself? What kind of world do I want to live/play/fight in?

> In my experience, this element has made usually interaction-adverse players a lot more willing to really explore the tangled interactions of Oath.

**Oath** isn't technically a legacy game but because of some creative shifts in design, this may end up being the best storytelling game we've seen yet.  The players aren't being railroaded down predetermined branching paths but rather laying the foundation for their group's future (and future, and future) decisions... and isn't that what ""legacy"" should really mean?

Then a bit further along in the post:

> Players might help/hinder a player for any number of reasons. All i mean to say is that Oath has a framework for responding to the metagame in a way that nothing I've ever worked on before does. This opens up some areas for play that are usually more closely associated with roleplaying games (though Oath is definitely not a roleplaying game).

Cole's seriously out here playing 4D Chess.  **Root** and **Pax Pamir 2E** were paradigm shifters and now here comes **Oath**.  It's crazy but could this last one be even *more* influential on the hobby than the other two?"|wallysmith127|False|https://redd.it/ehi2ta|37|0.81|0|32|1|boardgames

ehmkj6|2019-12-30 14:19:34|Looking for a board game... help!|I recently played a board game at a cafe and forgot to write the name down. It’s a board game where there’s a board (up to 12 points) and everyone takes turns being the „dealer“. The dealer picks up the first card, chooses a difficulty of a word (I, II, and III) and then picks up the remaining cards for the remainder of people at the table. The dealer shuffles the cards and then hands them out to all players. The dealer indicates which difficulty they chose, and each person draws a clue of what word they received on the chosen difficulty (the dealer gets to choose the difficulty on the first card and that’s what they draw as their clue). Everyone draws a clue (it can’t be too obvious) then everyone votes who got the dealer‘s first card and chosen clue for the difficulty and who is their „mate“ (ie. The person with the drawing of the clue that is similar to the dealer‘s). If you guessed right you advance on the board. The board is long and not too wide and just goes 0-12. once you reach 12 you can pick up a piece for your player that says 12 and you start at 0 again, collecting more points. I believe this game was created in Germany and I think it starts with an I. It comes in a smaller box with white and purple/pink on it.

I recently played Orleans Stories and it's a bag building game/worker placement (you put your workers in a bag and pull them to place.) I *really* liked it but it is CUTTHROAT because you can be *eliminated* from the game with a couple of terrible moves. I got second place the first time we played it and then got stone-cold eliminated. It is a massive game and great fun (you can decrease the difficulty on it.)

But get ready for a steep learning curve and you have to look at ahead at what you are building so it not only helps you NOW, but LATER. If Orleans and Agricola made out and had a consensual, yet brief encounter, this is the baby they would have made.

I've never worked so hard to manage my workers and make sure I have the right stuff to build and store.

Just recently played our copy of Azul Summer Pavilion, we had a lot of fun! Adds more depth and puzzle than the original Azul.

But i have a question,

If at the end of the picking stage, for instance, i have 5 blue pieces and 2 wild purples (because it is the first round, so purple is wild this time) i understand i can do the following with them:

* Combine all 5 blue pieces and 1 wild purple and fill in a ""6"" slot, either the 6 on the blue star or the 6 on the center star, if there is no blue in it.
* Get 5 Pieces of blue and put it in a ""5"" slot, either the 5 on the blue star or the 5 on the center star, if there is no blue in it.

My question is, can i also do this?

* Get 3 pieces of blue and put it in a ""3"" slot, either the 3 on the blue star or the 3 on the center star, if there is no blue in it AND THEN, on another turn in the same scoring stage, get the other 3 pieces of blue, combine them with the other 2 wild purples and fill in a 5 slot?

OR

* Get 2 pieces of blue to fill in the 2 on blue star, then the other 3 pieces of blue to fill in the 3 in blue star?

Basically, my doubt is in regard to SPLITTING the same color to fill more spaces (you know, maybe for strategy, because i wanna wall some circles/statues) other than just fill the top slot possible for my combination?

I'm curious, with conversations stating that Civ imbalance is only part of the issue but some Tapestry cards simply being OP depending on when they're received or how they synergize with a Civ, would separating specific Tapestry cards so that they're only accessible at certain points in the game mitigate this by chance? Could one have certain ""OP"" cards or those with really great bonuses shuffled in once everyone has made it to their 2nd era or something?

eh2w1k|2019-12-29 06:51:15|"Please don't overlook Catan: Starfarers simply because it's a ""Catan"" game!"|"Years ago I played a game known as *The Starfarers of Catan.* I loved it. I had never played *Catan*, though I had heard about it. I thought to myself ""If this is what *Catan* is like I can see why it's so popular!"". After some time I had a chance to play the original *The Settlers of Catan,* and I expected a similar experience. But **there was so much missing**, even with *The Seafarers of Catan* added in - the game was just not on the same level. It was so easy to fall behind or have dead starts, too much information stayed hidden, and there was no sense of player growth or big decisions. I don't hate regular *Catan*, but it really felt bad compared to *Starfarers*.  


Of course *Starfarers* was not without its own problems. The cool ships you outfitted and flew around in were brittle and prone to breaking (literally, the plastic would break from regular use), the board layout was not adjustable (even the expansion had you place **permanent stickers** on the board), you still had to deal with resource numbers that practically never get rolled, and the encounters while exciting could add to the sense of randomness.  


It's been a long time since that original version has been in print, and it has become very hard to find. I never owned it myself and because I did not pick it up in a timely fashion it became a rarity. But lo-and-behold a new version just came out! After a few games I feel like a ton of stuff has been fixed in what I already consider a great game. The ships are sturdier and the add-ons are better designed, the board is variable, new resource discs combine 2 low number such as 2 & 11 or 3 & 12 to help smooth-out production,  a steady supply of resource cards for all players below a certain point level keeps the game rolling, and you can adjust the colored balls in your ships to have more, less, or even no encounters depending on how you want to play!  


*Catan: Starfarers* in my opinion is a marked improvement over the original, and as great of a core experience as ever!  
It offers a level of satisfying progression and player growth that regular *Catan* is just missing, and is considerably less back-breaking if the dice are not in your favor. Even so, it may still be too random for some - if you do not like even a little randomness, then that might be a deal breaker.  


I really recommend it, and if you have avoided it simply because it is a *Catan* game you might be surprised!"|ManbosMambo|False|https://redd.it/eh2w1k|425|0.88|0|129|1|boardgames

ehbpxl|2019-12-29 21:21:06|How does one get better at engine building and creating combinations?|"I'm fairly new to boardgames and have been playing some Euro games with a boardgaming group. I've noticed quite some players using the same combinations of cards/resources over and over again in a game to create even more resources and/or gain victory points. Usually, to even buy buildings/cards/resources that give you such advantages, you need to start off with a decent amount of money (even if they claim money doesn't get you victory points, I've realized it's important). In the last game I played with 3 other players (Troyes), I had a bad start where I had no other choice but to place one of my meeples in the military section (my turn was last), which required me to spend a lot of money in each round to retain my meeple there (I was actually relieved that the meeple in the military was knocked off in the 4th round so I didn't have to pay more money for it). So my first question is, **how does one offset a bad start?**

I've also noticed that when a boardgame is more spatial and spread out, I find it difficult to detect patterns and possible ways to build combos, as it seems overwhelming since there are so many variables involved (visually/spatially) and there are multiple viable actions. So my second question is, **how does one get better at detecting combos and getting better at engine building?** Should I in the meanwhile be sabotaging others' engines cuz I don't have my own positive feedback loop (like in Troyes, by knocking off their meeples so they cannot play those corresponding colored dice in the next rounds and thus they cannot utilise the resources/buildings they've built to create the engine)?

While I will do detailed painting on the unique minis, I am looking to just paint the army minis to match their nationality's color.

If spray painting them, is there a brand to go for?

I've plenty of paint here from my other painting projects, but I've always done detailed work on things, not something this basic.  (Even spray painted, I'll likely do a quick wash on them just to bring out the highlights a bit.)  So I'm at a bit of a loss as to the best way to approach this.

Set it up yesterday to play the first scenario with my wife and... wow, it's complicated.

We also didn't make it past the second room so:

1. We were playing as Mindthief and Spellweaver. Is there a better combination of the six starting classes to get going with?
2. The Spellweaver has a card that lets her recover all her lost cards but the Mindthief doesn't have this same ability - so how do you get through all three rooms, defeat everything and not run out of cards?
3. It felt like we were not able to do enough damage - I think we managed to defeat 1 elite and 2 normals out of the six starting bandits by the time the Mindthief ran out of cards, and we seemed to draw a lot of -1 modifiers when fighting (it didn't help that the first road card gave me three more -1 modifier cards for the scenario)
4. Is there a better written set of rules or some cheat sheets that someone can recommend - we thought the rule book was poor and didn't give enough examples. It kept saying ""some abilities..."" without going into more detail which was driving us mad
5. Are there any class - specific guides that people would recommend reading, especially about which combos of cards work best

I can understand why a lot of people say they play solo because I think you have to have a bit of a sadistic streak in you. I've also read that it doesn't actually matter if you finish scenarios or not, you still get the experience and loot. But if you're playing with someone for whom failure at anything is the worst thing that could happen then that won't cut it. I need to get better at understanding the game so we can complete the scenarios.

egzf8n|2019-12-29 01:22:23|[COMC] 1.5 Years|"\[COMC\] The shelf just arrived and so the games are just kind of thrown in where they could fit for now, but this is my collection.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4qcpgf9y3h741.jpg?width=4500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=140553f9581f474e2ac0f02b2d08d816b03cbc4d

*How long have you been in the hobby?*   I've loved board games since I was a kid, but only ever experienced the more mainstream sorts of games like Life, Clue, and Cranium was always a favorite.  I didn't really start to add to my collection until about a 1.5 years ago.  That's when I started buying the bulk of the games I now own, though I have some from various years and some I don't even remember how I got them.  

The game that got me into gaming was Forbidden Island.  That was my first newer style of game.  I really enjoyed it, but didn't really bother with collecting until I bought Ticket to Ride and that's when the collecting took off.  I research now a lot more before buying than I did, but my main goal with this is to have a wide variety for when my daughter is old enough to play, since right now I have to kinda guilt people into wanting to play with me.  

I also look for unique mechanics when buying games.  Anything I haven't seen before or that does it in a cool/unique way.  This type of searching led to **Magic Maze**, **Spaceteam**, **Flatline**, and **Captain Sonar**.

*What would you change about your collection if you could?*  I don't know that I would change anything just now.  I'm pretty happy with most of my choices.  Though, I have discovered that I'm not as into Euro games as I thought and so **Castles of Burgundy** doesn't really hold up for me as the other elements fall so flat and I don't like the game play enough.  I love party games and bluffing games (though I am awful at bluffing games) but sadly never seem to get that many people around to play.  

*Favorites:*  
*No Particular Order*

**Wingspan** This has become my top my favorite game.  It's so beautiful and the components are nice and I like engine building.  I will add that drafting cards in the beginning is a must for me, since you could easily get stuck with cards that don't build anything at the start and so have to waste a lot of turns getting there, which can put you way behind.  We also do a few house rules, but I tend to do that with most games.  Nothing major, just a tweak here or if we don't feel like looking up a rule during the game we just all agree and go with it.  It's about having fun, so to me, that's all that matters.

**Code 777** I have to add this because this game gets played the most because it's my husband's favorite.  It's a logic puzzle sort of game that is very simple, but there's a lot to think about.  My husband loves this game and while I do enjoy it, it's not a favorite.  He usually wins, too.  I also made sure to bought my copy of this from DiceTree directly.  It was a bit more expensive but I'm glad I did.  It's a much better copy than any I've seen with all the player boards being dry erase.

**Concept** This game is fun if you don't take it seriously.  We just play pick up cards and make guesses and then do another.  We don't even play teams, but the way you put together the pics can be really interesting.  Makes for very creative playing and even simple clues can be really hard to figure out until you hear the answer and then the clues click. (Or the person was really stretching it with their clues).

**Sheriff of Nottingham** Not going to lie, a part of me really liked this game when I was able to beat my one brother (who is very competitive and good at most games he tries) at this by playing him.  I basically always assumed he was lying, always assumed he would check my bag, and only took risks with other players.  As predicted, he always checked my bag and he more often than not tried to sneak in contraband.  He got decimated (by my mom, funny enough, she killed it with a whole pile of gold) but it was still a victory for me because he was dead last.  

**Spaceteam** everyone I show this to loves the game, but it's so hard to get a group to actually play it at first.  This is a quick game that's a lot of chaos and is hilarious if you don't take it too seriously.  Best with kids, too.  

*Honorable mentions*: **Flatline**, **Splendor**, **Castle Panic**, **Captain Sonar**

*Newest Game*s: Not pictured (arriving soon) **Point Salad**, **Arboretum**, and **Menara**.  

As far as games leaving my collection, I don't think I'll make any cuts until my daughter is older.  I want to hold out and see what she likes first.  We already play games together (the hungry hippos, kerplunk, and the more adult ones with modified rules, though it mostly just turns into pretending to be various pieces).  She may like Euros, which I would definitely play with her regardless of what I think of them."|celticvampriss|False|https://redd.it/egzf8n|191|0.87|0|92|1|boardgames
ehf7hd|2019-12-30 01:48:14|Brand New Catan Set Missing ItemsQuestion|"Hi guys, so I just received a copy of Catan (It was wrapped in a plastic layer) as a gift. Its the base game version for 3-4 players and not an expansion set. When I was unwrapping everything I noticed it came with two separate packs of cards wrapped in plastic.

&#x200B;

Upon opening the cards i realized the two decks had the same exact cards. I now have a box of Catan with 38 rock cards and 32 brick cards and no other resource cards. This makes it quite difficult to play the game with only two resources. The cards I have are as follows:

* 38 Rock
* 32 Brick
* 2 Library
* 2 Market
* 2 Great Hall
* 2 Chapel
* 2 University
* 4 Monopoly'
* 4 Road Building
* 4 Year of plenty
* 28 Knights

A friend told me about this so I will have to confirm with them but they described this game last night and I really want to figure it out now. So there’s one rule/mechanic of the game that they really remember.

People have stacks of the category cards in front of them. If person A takes a card from the top stack of person B (can’t remember the reason/rule for taking cards) and the card below the top card says “kinds of shoes” then person A and person B race to see who can name a kind of shoe fastest and if person B can name a kind of shoe faster they don’t get their card stolen.

* This is the last turn
* You are playing with Everfrost
* Current points are 3-4, Sylvan is winning
* Because it is last turn and we have ""Frozen Chest"" - we can drag any ""frozen effect"" from the deck except ""Ice Princess"", because it is in our hand.

Just in time to tempt many of your upcoming new year resolutions... Each week I plan on releasing a very short set of rules to a board game to turn it into a drinking game. 

Plenty of games in my collection just aren't going to hit the table any more, Ticket to Ride for example. A great game, but without spicing it up a bit I have other games I'd rather play... Unless we add some drinking rules to it. 

The plan is these rules should affect the balance of the game 0. Instead, just punish and reward you and give you an excuse to play games and drink. 

Before we get started, drink responsibly. Don't drink a dumb amount and then do dumb things. 

Below are the 6 rules to make up *Chugga Chugga Brew Brew*

* **Rule 1-** You may give away 1 drink for every train worth of track that you lay that is not gray

* **Rule 2-** Laying gray track is the easy route; for being a big 'ol wuss, If you lay gray track, you must drink the number of drinks equal to 7-X where X is the number of trains laid. (More simply put, 1 track means 6 drinks, 6 tranks means 1 drink)

* **Rule 3-** If someone audibly or visually shows frustration for a player specifically taking a certain route they must drink for the number of trains on that track. 

* **Rule 4-** When a player places a route, another player may shout “Challenge!” The player who placed a route must say if the two cities connected in the route are the capital of that state/province. The possible answers are “Neither” “One is” or “Both Are”. If they are wrong, they drink. If they are right, the Challenger Drinks. 

**At the End of the Game**

* **Rule 5-** Drink 2 for every destination card you hold but can’t score at the end of the game 

* **Rule 6-** The player who wins divides his score by 10 and divides that many drinks (rounded up) amongst the losers. 
       

Last bit of clarification in case you've literally never played a drinking game before... a drink here is not 1 full beer. It is simply one hearty sip of your drink.

eh2lpx|2019-12-29 06:19:08|Better ways to end TI4?|"TL;DR: What house rules does anyone have to make the end of TI4 feel as compelling as the rest of the game?

Long version: I just finished my first ever game of TI4. I was playing with my two brothers (one older, one younger), both of whom were also playing for the first time. After 8 hours, on what would end up being the final turn, the board state was thus. My older brother, playing Hacan, had 8 victory points, and was poised to claim a 2-point public objective at the end of the round. My younger brother, playing JolNar, had 7 victory points and was in control of mecatol rex. For what it's worth, I was playing Xxacha, had 5 victory points, and no path to victory.  My older brother launched a massive attack and seized both Jol and Nar from my younger brother. Taking the next turn, my little brother played Imperial, scored a 2 point objective, and got the extra victory point for mecatol rex, giving him 10 victory points and the win. Everyone congratulated each other for surviving the game. I thought it was thematically odd that my brother could win while his home planets were occupied, so I checked the rules and saw that, in fact, he could not score a public objective while they were so.  We reset the board state and gave him the opportunity to liberate his home system for the victory, but he was unable to do so. My older brother ultimately ended up winning. 

Some observations:

1) playing TI4 is a blast. I loved almost every minute of it. My watch said 8 hours passed, my mind didn't believe it.

2)  the conclusion (both times, as it turned out) came suddenly and did not provide much in the way of denouement. We were playing, and then it was over.  It was worse the second time, especially for my little brother, owing to the reset, but was still palpable the first time.

Based on comments by others about this game, I don't think that this is a unique experience. What do you, the kind people of Reddit, do to alleviate this feeling? Are there any house rules, rituals, or role playing activities you use to make the end feel like the climax to a grand space opera?"|Themadhunter249|False|https://redd.it/eh2lpx|3|0.67|0|11|1|boardgames

The Magic Track technically didn't move to tier 3, but the staff sort of makes it such for just me. Thanks!"|staleBear|False|https://redd.it/eh2o8f|6|0.64|0|3|1|boardgames
egy536|2019-12-28 23:35:40|Just played my second game of Counter Attack! What a blast!|"I backed Counter Attack on Kickstarter earlier in the year, and it arrived to me in the USA (game shipped from UK) a couple weeks ago. What a great game!

Counter Attack is a soccer simulation which takes place on a hex grid. You start the game by drafting a team from a deck of player cards, and then the rest of the game is turn based movement, passing, shooting, etc. There's quite a few rules but they all make pretty good sense thematically. That said, your first game will be a little clunky as you get used to all the mechanics.

I scored against my wife early in the first half. Towards the end of the half, I fouled her inside the box, so she got a penalty shot. She scored, tying the game at 1-1.

Nothing too eventful until the end of the second half, where she took a shot from outside the penalty area right before the clock went out. I got a defender in the way and deflected the ball to a fellow defender, ending the game in a tie.

So fun! Highly recommend to fellow soccer fans. Very tactical experience with a lot of depth.

I was on my way to exit the dungeon and I grab the first secret tome of the game. Sitting there the entire game on the top secret tome was the one that said “when you see this, read X”. It sat there the entire time in plain sight and we didn’t see it. Was a awesome little secret hidden gem in the game and I can’t  wait to see what else is gonna be hidden from us. 
We were lucky to see this during our 2nd game. I am wondering about how far into their campaign games did other people find this card and if anyone else had it sitting there unnoticed."|CoolBowTiesAre|False|https://redd.it/eh1vys|6|0.74|0|3|1|boardgames

I was going to play with my teenage son, who is also really excited to play, but he woke up with the flu and can barely move, so it looks like I'll have a run-though on my own before he's ready to play co-op.

Anyway, I'm really excited about having this in my collection, and can't wait to get started once some housework is done.
