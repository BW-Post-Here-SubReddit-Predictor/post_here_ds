##Streamlining asking and receiving advice

This community actively redirects short simple questions into daily recurring megathreads.  

This is so that a community of 2+ million users doesn't get overwhelmed by the sheer number of posts, and that good substantive quality content doesn't get drowned out. Instead, short questions like ""what colors go with navy?"" or ""can any identify this jacket from a picture?"" get answered quickly and doesn't clutter up the frontpage of our community. 

Don't let this scare you though! You're more than welcome to post large scale wardrobe rehabilitation posts. Of if you're seeking obscure information, or have a special circumstances that makes an answer in the megathread unlikely. For example, dealing with a medical condition or information on a particular subculture.

Finally if you've posted in the Daily Questions megathread several times and don't believe you've received a satisfactory answer, just shoot us a message and we can approve a post.

For further information of all this please [see here](/r/malefashionadvice/wiki/rules#wiki_simple_questions) or contact the moderators.

## Getting Started: The Most Basic Advice

These guides give a basic outline on dressing better and developing your own personal style. Think of it as the textbook for ""MFA 101: Introduction to Dressing Well"".

###The ""Basic Bastard""/Basic Wardrobe

This is a wardrobe created for someone who is new to the idea of dressing better. It is very simple, basic, and has relatively few items that should be available at most retailers. Note that the name of the ""Basic Bastard"" guide and wardrobe is meant to be tongue-in-cheek humour.

&#x200B;

I decided in late October I wanted to take the Bespoke plunge with a local tailor in Austin, Ross Bennett ([http://thetexastailor.com/](http://thetexastailor.com/)). Well the results are in and I got my suit.

I ended up getting a three piece suit with Huddersfield (English mill, owns The Rake Magazine) fabric.

The goal was to get something classic and timeless that fits.  While I love Suitsupply for example many of their stuff is too tight on my athletic build.  As far as this suit I will say that when I put this on it felt right on point to my measurements. 

You will also note the 4"" notch lapel (most RTW suits have a 3.5"" - 4"" lapel). I was frankly concerned on how it would look on me but given my proportions it actually accentuates my chest and shoulders a lot without throwing things off. 

Note the pick stitching on the lapel as well.

The suit has a light canvas between the fabric so it's lightweight. I also decided to go with light shoulder padding to accentuate what I already have naturally!   I like the waistcoat also. If I could do it all over again I'd probably make some slight changes to the waistcoat such as making it 5 buttons instead of four and changing the shape of it a bit but overall I'm satisfied with it.

The lining you'll see is a world map in royal purple.  Thanks to my girlfriend for picking it out for me!

Some notes on the details of the paints: I opted for side tabs instead of belt loops. Frankly you don't need a belt if your suit is Bespoke or MTM because it should fit perfectly on your waist.  I also got a small coin pocket on my pants as well. 2"" cuffs. I'm 6'1'' and they sit nicely on the bottom of my shoes. They also add weight to the pants to drape a bit for the pleats.

The single pleats offer me extra room in my legs and thighs though in hindsight I didn't necessarily need them since these pants fit great. They do hide any sort of stuff I put in my pockets though and they don't make the pants or the entire silhouette of the suit any less rakish.

Having done this whole process I will say at first I was excited but not without any trepidation or worry about the process.  Would I get everything spot on or would it look like a mess?  I'd certainly do it again and looking forward to making more custom pieces."|baitlyn|False|https://redd.it/el01e4|14|0.8|0|9|1|malefashionadvice

el1g79|2020-01-06 22:23:42|X Post from GYW - GMTO of Carlos Santos Field Boots in Wine Shadow|"&#x200B;

Hi Everyone,

probably not the post that you are used to seeing here, but I have seen from time to time us appreciating a good pair of shoes. It is a part of our style after all.

So, with the initiative of another redditor (slayer\_mike) and some guys at r/goodyearwelt we have been organizing a **GMTO** for the boots you see in the picture.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/ejl731/gmto_interest_check_carlos_santos_field_boots_in/)

Essentially the boot is made by **Carlos Santos**, but with a **Dainite Rubber Sole** this time and a price of **315$** and **free shipping internationally**. If you are in the **EU, add +25% VAT**. It has a lead time of about **2-3 months, usually around 2**.

We have gathered enough people, but thought it might be a good idea to check if some of you might want to join! This is **goodyear welted** and **hand patinated** in **Wine Shadow color** (burgundy shades) and is very similar to Edward Green's iconic Galway in Rosewood. I call this the Salway :)

You are more than welcome to PM me here or leave a comment and I will try to reply to all of you. We will go through with this in the next couple of days.

**PS. I hope this does not break any rules, if so, please PM me and I will amend/delete. I am not sure this counts as crowdfunding (side bar rules), we just gathered 5-7 people that wanted to remake the boot posted on the sub.**

Best,

el1ck7|2020-01-06 22:16:44|New to colognes|"As the title says. I've never really worn fragrances before, as I worked in a scent free environment for years.
Job has changed, etc, and I'm now dating a woman who absolutely adores perfumes (she has a pretty amazing collection) and colognes. I've discovered a love for them, but want to diversify the kinds of scents I have. So far I have three:

Bvlgari Man Black (not be confused with Man in Black) - she's loved this one, and finds it clean, fresh, and enticing.

Versace Eros Flame - this one was a gift from her. She finds it woodsy (especially when the base notes come out) and if she smells it on me before we go out, well...we're not going out for a while.

Armani Acqua di Gio - an older one, definitely. She's pretty blasé about this one. I had selected it based on being told it's a ""classic"".

I'd like to be able to shake it up a little. I've got a clean, fresh smelling one, and a spicier, woodsy one (probably won't wear the Armani much as it doesn't grab her). What scents could you all suggest that have a different scent profile to the Bvlgari and Versace ones, that get great reactions from the ladies? She's got such a keen sense of smell that I'd like to surprise her with something new."|Zancetyo|False|https://redd.it/el1ck7|6|1.0|0|5|1|malefashionadvice

el0poi|2020-01-06 21:33:11|Sportcoat advice|"I'm sure this has been asked a million times and answered even more...but...here goes nothing.

I need a new sportcoat.  The ones I have are either too big (think something that could double as a dining fly) or too small (think Chris Farley in Tommy Boy) due to fluctuating weight over time.  I've finally settled into a steady weight and my new job has presented a need for a good sportcoat that'll match my existing work shirts whenever we have a meeting with our consultants.  I typically wear either short- or long-sleeve button-ups with khakis for the comfort of them.  The colors I'd need to match most times are light blue, purple (LSU version), and light yellow.  I've always had navy blue blazers but feel like that's...boring.  Is there another color that'd work better with what I've got?  If navy is still the way to go, so be it, but would a brown or gray work better?.  What about patterns?  I'm seeing all manner of things out there (micro-checks, windowpane, etc) that I don't know about.

ekwvuj|2020-01-06 17:05:02|Buy Sell Thread - January 06|"###Thread Rules

- All listings **must** be posted from reputable platforms like Grailed, Ebay, Depop, Poshmark, etc. 

- All transactions are to be conducted through these sites. If you go offsite, you do so at your own risk.

- **All disputes should be handled through Grailed/Ebay/Paypal.**
__________________________________

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers. 

- Ask for measurements if there aren't any. Tag sizes vary wildly. 

If you want to do a trade: 

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection."|AutoModerator|False|https://redd.it/ekwvuj|4|0.71|0|19|1|malefashionadvice

ekuh3x|2020-01-06 13:58:20|Thoughts on British Belt Company?|"I purchased my first real leather belt (the others had been faux or 'genuine') on recommendation from this sub around 5 years ago. I got a Thistleton in tan, the cheapest one I could afford, and I absolutely loved it. After 5 or so years its developed a lovely patina, the colour has darkened and its stretched out a lot (see how many extra holes I've had to add).

I decided it had stretched out enough so bought another one - the same Thistleton (in a different colour).

However when it arrived I'm kind of skeptical that this is the same belt of the same quality. Just the fact that both sides are smooth seems a bit off.

Anyone else had similar experience?

ek4t8n|2020-01-04 23:59:55|Suggestions for a high-end slim-fit wool / cashmere coat?|"Hey fashion gurus,

I'm looking for recommendations for a high-end wool / cashmere coat for a tall slender man. This would ideally be a topcoat, could be a peacoat or overcoat. I've browsed a lot of threads and looked in a lot of stores, both physical and online (partial list below), and it's been hard to find something that checks all the right boxes. I'm hoping you dapper gents can point me in a useful direction!

Relevant info:

* I'm looking to spend <= $2,000.
* I'm 6'2"", about 175 lbs. Narrow shoulders, pretty thin. I need to get measurements, but the size 40 Cucinelli pictured below fit me perfectly.
* I definitely want something that has definition to the shoulders and is slim-fit. (See pic below for an example.)
* Coat should end above the knees.
* Should primarily close via buttons. Zip is fine if it's a removable / secondary option.
* Prefer charcoal or black, solid color, no significant pattern.
* Prefer some cashmere, but not required.
* Coat should either have slanted pockets, or at least have pockets that are comfortable for resting one's hands in while the coat is closed.
* Single or double breasted doesn't really matter, but it is a plus if I can wear it with the collar up as well as down.
* I'm looking for an **elegant** coat but not a **formal** coat. My apologies for that sounding vague -- I don't really have a good vocabulary for what I mean here. The best I can say is that it shouldn't look or feel like it's skimping on anything, and it should nicely define the ideal thin man's body shape -- wider at the shoulders, slim-fit, and good straight lines when open and closed. (I want to avoid the hanging / draping look, e.g. from canvas trench coats -- and I also want to avoid coats with more curve around the hips, as that feels to me like a more feminine look.) 

I found a coat that was almost perfect at Mario's in Portland, a Brunello Cucinelli for $1850 with a lovely shape, style, and feel -- but with vertically-oriented pockets, positioned so that it doesn't feel natural to rest your hands in them when it's closed. So close and yet so far. 

I've checked with a lot of stores in the Bay Area and Portland, MrPorter, Neiman Marcus, J. Crew, Spier and Mackay ([this one](https://www.spierandmackay.com/charcoal-wool-cashmere-single-breast-overcoat.html) looked good but they don't have it in my size), Bonobos, Suit Supply ([this one](https://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/coats/dark-grey-overcoat/J726I.html?cgid=Coats&prefn1=materialID&prefv1=wool|cashmere) looks decent, maybe too flared in the hips), Yoox, and several others.

Any thoughts?

Looking to improve my wardrobe for when I’m in the office and also when I’m out of the office. A little background... I used to be big on streetwear and sneakers but grown out of that look. Looking to develop more of a fashionable grown look. What I wear to work now typically is jeans, sneakers, and polo. Looking to dress up a bit more than that, not because I have to but I want to. 

I know there’s the guide and sidebar but lost on how to start... I’m 6 foot 190 by the way and will continue to bulk a bit, muscular body. Only things to work with Bred 1’s and Some cheap black Chelsea boots right now I found on amazon... so essentially starting from ZERO. Donating basically all old clothing that either doesn’t fit or doesn’t transition well into the new style I want to develop.

Pieces I want to start with

- well fitting jeans that have stretch material since I’m bulking in the gym and thighs will continue to grow (navy, black, khaki)
- white Italian leather designer shoes
- jacket
- blazers 
- grey tees or neutral colors 

I’m limited on time and I am aware that it’s a learning process but i Also don’t see this becoming a big hobby due to time constraints (but
Who knows) Some links or online store recommendations would be great."|roadtoriches92|False|https://redd.it/ek95os|0|0.53|0|32|1|malefashionadvice

ejxul4|2020-01-04 15:21:16|I need advice on finding well-fitting shirts with one arm (a lot) bigger than the other|"Hello! Long time reader, first time poster.  

To get right into it, I was born with a benign tumour in my left arm that essentially means it is twice the size of my right arm. This has made finding well-fitting shirts a nightmare. During the day I typically wear short-sleeve T-shirts which fit fine, but I could never wear a long sleeve shirt without it being painfully uncomfortable.  

This is fine for ordinary day wear, but I am about to graduate university and begin working in offices and going to formal events. Finding dress shirts has been difficult. If I can find a shirt where my arm will fit in the sleeve, the length of the shirt will essentially be a dress as well as fitting weirdly around the collar. Getting such a shirt adjusted at a tailor would have cost £50, which I cannot afford to do for every shirt.

Does MFA have any ideas for a solution that would also be inexpensive? All that I could think of would be wearing short-sleeve shirts, but do these work with suits etc? Or, is it possible to find dress shirts that are 'baggy'? Sorry if that is a silly question, I am new to formal wear!

ejyw1e|2020-01-04 16:44:26|Looking for Custom Suit Advice for Wedding|"Good morning! 

I am coming to all of you at Male Fashion Advice for advice on suits for my Wedding this coming August. I want to get out in front of this and have plenty of time to make changes as needed and despite trying to do some research online information appears to be all over the place. 

For some quick background, I live in the Chicago-land area. I have an athletic build at 6'0"" and some change, weighing about 240lbs. Broad shoulders, huge neck, large quads. Suits and nicer clothing have always been miserable for me to shop for because anything that fits my necks tends will cause the chest and waist to be immensely oversized. Any pants that fit my waist often are extremely tight in the quads and I feel like going from sitting to standing risks ripping my pants. I'm also a sweater and the wedding is in August in Michigan...mostly indoor but I'm sure pictures and stepping outside will happen so a stretchy, breathable fabric would be nice to have. 

So what my fiance and I think would be best is going the custom route and this way I would also have a suit that actually fits me for the first in my life that I can wear if needed going forward. This is where I'm looking for input. I had originally looked in to some of the custom suit companies I had heard of on the radio like Indochino or Enzo Custom but the reason I am uncertain of going to a place like this is that we want the groomsmen in the wedding to have similar style and color suits without having to force them to go get custom suits of their own. 

The other options we considered was Men's Warehouse which, from some searches I did on this subreddit, is heresy. However, it would allow my groomsmen to have very similar suits (which my fiance wants). I also was in the wedding of friend who did a custom through Men's Warehouse and he seemed to have a good experience. He does have a much more normal build than I do, though, which certainly plays into that. 

I'm definitely open to advice and have seen places like Suit Supply mentioned as a step up from Men's Warehouse or Joseph A Bank (who I have never had a good experience with). We're probably looking to spend around $1000 at the top end but knowing that I won't be wearing this suit often after the wedding means I'm leaning towards a less expensive option if possible. 

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this and offer suggestions and I'll be happy to answer whatever questions that I can!"|Asakura_|False|https://redd.it/ejyw1e|5|0.86|0|6|1|malefashionadvice
ejm4cf|2020-01-03 21:32:03|If you had $1000 for your suit/professional wardrobe how would you spend it?|"For Christmas, my parents were extremely generous and are giving me 1000 dollars to help me buy a suit or a couple of suits that I can use when I finally get a job after college.  The most expensive suit I have worn to this point is one that I got at Kohl's for about 135 dollars, so I am completely in over my head for this purchase.  Recently, I also got a sport coat tailored and am in love with the way it fits me compared to one right off of the shelf, so I am leaning towards getting a custom one right now.

A few things about me and what I am looking for:

I am a smaller/slimmer guy (5'8"" and about 140lbs) so it is difficult for me to find suits that fit my frame and especially around my arms, where shirts and coats tend to look like wing suits.

I am planning to go into sales and want a suit that will both hold up for travel and look sharp.

I would prefer to work with a reputable company like Brooks Brothers, but that is really the only one that I know off the top of my head.

I live in the Philadelphia region but go to school in North Carolina, if their are any place you would specifically recommend that I go to.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, I am so excited to see what you all come up with! Thank You!"|bobbyop|False|https://redd.it/ejm4cf|32|0.91|0|53|1|malefashionadvice

&#x200B;

I'm a 21 year old British guy.

I'm looking for your take on the essentials of a classy mens wardrobe -

I work in an office 45 hours per week but don't earn a massive amount, I'm looking for some timeless classics that I can invest in over the course of a year to have a stylish and manageable interchangeable wardrobe.

I once saw a cheat sheet created by Antonio from Real Men Real Style however it seemed quite ""dated"" and the comments he received also reflected that.

&#x200B;

What would you recommend? for suits, blazers, trousers, shoes, accessories.

I don't have a large budget, it would be approximately £200 per year.

My office doesn't have a strict dress code, anything is acceptable apart from Casual dress, I'm ideally looking for a mixture of formal and business casual to allow me to be more diverse depending on my plans for the day. At the moment, I own a charcoal grey suit, tweed blazer, navy blazer and I normally wear Navy Chinos and a white shirt. Shoes are normally Brown John White shoes or Dark Brown Chukka Boots.

I work in federal consulting which requires me to dress business casual to business professional daily. The last dress pants that I bought, I bought 2 years ago for my internship. They are 34x30 and were very tight at the time. Now they literally fall straight off of me without a belt and look to be 1” too long (bunch at the ankles). I have since lost about 30lb of fat and tried some on at Jos Bank yesterday and fit pretty well in the 30W, but they felt pretty low quality. So that leaves me two questions:

1.	How much can I tailor my existing pants? They would need to be brought in at least 3” at the waist, shortened about 1”, and I’m not sure what else. 
2.	What brands/styles should I check out for some new ones? Ideally they taper at the ankle a bit since I dress modern. I have searched this sub but haven’t seen recent recommendations.

I'm looking for some advice in diversifying my shoe wardrobe towards a more formal, mature look. Currently, 85% of the shoes I own are some sort of sneaker (Jordans, Yeezys, Air Force 1s, Vans,  etc). My dressiest sneaker is a pair of the Greats Royales, which I love but don't bust out very often. 

I have two pairs of Clark's dress shoes (in brown and black), I believe this is the model: https://www.clarksusa.com/c/Tilden-Cap/p/26110309
I need to replace the black pair as I've had them for a very long time and they are basically destroyed. 

For boots, I have a pair of dark brown Timbs meant for hiking that I use to navigate NYC winters. I also have a pair of black chukka boots that are waterproof for the same reason. 


I was looking at picking up two pairs of shoes. The first is this Chelsea boot from blundstone: https://www.blundstone.com/shop/rustic-black-leather-chelsea-boots-mens-style-587


The second is a pair of black dress shoes from Allen Edmonds: https://www.allenedmonds.com/shoes/mens-shoes/dress-shoes/boulevard-cap-toe-dress-shoe/SF7482.html?dwvar_SF7482_color=7482#start=1

I was curious if the dress shoes are formal enough to rock with suits, but casual enough to wear with chinos and a tucked in dress shirt with a tie. I dress business casual at work every day except 1, where we are expected to dress ""professionally"", which basically just means tuck your shirt in and wear a tie and dress shoes. 

*Forgot to add, I am a teacher and on my feet most of the day- a comfortable shoe is a must.* 


One small limiting factor is the fact that I wear size 14 shoes.

As stated this is self-imposed which means you can adopt the rules that you would like to engage with. See some examples below but feel free to adjust or add based on your personnel belief
 (Taken from /u/thewardrobenerd's [FFA Low/No Buy: January - March 2020](https://old.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/efvy1f/ffa_lowno_buy_january_march_2020/) post on /r/femalefashionadvice 

>* Buy nothing whatsoever.
>* Reduce the *number* of items you buy (such as the [20 in 2020 challenge](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6IweobnvP-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)).
>* Reduce the monthly or quarterly *amount* you spend.
>* Create a list of what you will need and only purchase those items.
>* Only buy from a certain type of retailer such as [not buying new](https://www.instagram.com/notbuyingnew/?hl=en) or only buying from local small businesses.
>* For each item you want to buy but don’t, donate a certain percentage of money to your charity of choice or put a certain amount in a savings account.
>* Do something more extreme - [only wear one outfit](https://mymodernmet.com/julia-mooney-one-outfit-100-days-project/) or [don’t shop at all](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/opinion/sunday/shopping-consumerism.html).

**Why should I participate in No Jawnz/No Cop January?**

Some potential reasons that you may be interested in are:

* Simply just saving money for future purchases
* Taking time to appreciate your current wardrobe and the clothing that you do have 
* Wearing through your closet might give you a greater understanding of gaps or holes in your wardrobe

**I want to do this, but I don’t know how to be successful.** (Again taken from /u/thewardrobenerd's [FFA Low/No Buy: January - March 2020](https://old.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/efvy1f/ffa_lowno_buy_january_march_2020/) post on /r/femalefashionadvice 

>* Evaluate your current spending habits and create guidelines that are less than your current habits but still attainable. 
>* Be clear in your motivation for doing this - Are you trying to save money? Trying to escape [hyperconsumerism](https://blackminimalists.net/blog/the-effects-of-hyper-consumerism)? Trying to be more creative with what you already have? 
>* Unsubscribe, unfollow, and mute/hide social media accounts/emails that tempt you.
>* If you do find something you want, put it on a list and reevaluate later. Sometimes saying “maybe later” rather than “not at all” is enough to satisfy the urge.
>* Remember that breaking your rules once (or twice or three times) doesn’t ruin your entire no/low buy. If you buy something you weren’t planning on, it doesn’t mean you have to give up completely.

I mostly just wear whatever i have, blue slim jeans if i'm going outside with a brandless t-shirt tucked together with a classic leather belt, some jogger jacket that i otherwise use for bicycling and running, and running shoes because they are pretty comfortable but a bit worn, still works though. All this does not really match each other in colour, but it looks somewhat tidy because i always look tidy. On the other hand, every other teen in my age, or early twenties, are all usually wearing expensive leather shoes that are super uncomfortable, fancy jackets that look expensive and they even wear gloves! Leather gloves! So assume this is the fashion i'm supposed to use? It sounds really expensive and snobby, but i'm sure this could be found second hand? But if it doesn't well then i'm fugged, just thinking about the prices on this makes me feel uneasy even if i can afford it since i never really buy anything besides food and creatine and a vidya game once a year or so.|Thermawrench|False|https://redd.it/ej0pzl|8|0.65|0|15|1|malefashionadvice

eitls4|2020-01-02 04:56:46|Somewhat urgent advice for work clothes|"Hey guys! So i'm starting an internship tomorrow and I was looking for some basic, good price to quality ratio clothing items. 

The dress code is basically just no sneakers, sweats, tees. Jeans are fine and I believe polos/button downs are fine.

I was looking for recommendations on button downs and pants. I was thinking maybe wait for one of the common j crew sales but I wasn't too sure. For context, i mostly just wear comfortable clothing when I'm attending classes.

For shoes, i'm looking for basically any advice. I have dress shoes for my suit and one pair of wolverine boots (more style than function i guess), but I'm really lost on this one. I usually only wear one pair of sneakers. I think there are loafers, boat shoes, some other boots, but I wasn't sure what kinds of shoes were decently comfortable amd not too formal. I feel like the dresses shoes might be too formal to wear.

I really to take the time to read the guides and such, and I will try to do so over the weekend, but I wanted to make a post for maybe updated information and for the sake of urgency.

ej3qvm|2020-01-02 20:29:06|Desperately need help forming a wardrobe that will last me more than 3 months before I'm tired of it.|"I'm 16 so I'm always tight on money but ever since like a year and a half ago I've been really into differentiating myself through how I dress. Everything is just so open and there are so many possibilities but I'm having trouble narrowing down those possibilities and pinpointing how I want to dress and also building my wardrobe based off that knowledge.

I started out buying some replica pieces of clothing, until I realized that was a shitty style as I looked through more and more inspos and fashion pages. I think I formulated opinions on how I wanted to dress kind of fast, which didn't necessarily stick and I ended up buying some replicas and pieces from uniqlo or pacsun that lost their novelty pretty fast as I started further expanding my knowledge of what was out there in terms of fashion. It's not like I've been buying tacky shit like supreme box logos or heavily branded clothing, and I know I'm dressing miles better than I would have been a year ago, but the more I learn about designers, and digest more inspiration from stuff like photos, runways, or even grailed listings, the more I really want to try out different styles of fashion. Stuff like the ""slp"" aesthetic, or avante garde styles with desigers like yohji, rick, ann d, etc, all look really really cool and I want to move away from shit you could find on r/streetwear to something more unique. 

Obviously the biggest problem is money. With expensive, designer, statement pieces I feel like you have to be really careful about what you pick, and on top of that have a wardrobe that can fit around the style of whatever pieces you are purchasing for absurd prices. I guess I'm just having trouble finding a style that I want stick with, and also building a cohesive wardrobe that I will like for a while so that I'm not stuck constantly yearning for different clothes than what I currently have. 

I feel dumb writing this and really don't even know what advice can be given on this matter but I just wanted to write out my predicament anyway. thanks if you read this far and any advice or past experience would be really helpful to me"|genericrice|False|https://redd.it/ej3qvm|0|0.37|0|1|1|malefashionadvice

ei8o8i|2019-12-31 20:52:49|The Pedantry of Labels: Why Slimmer Men Should Shop in the Women's Section.|"So, hear me out here, because I know a lot of you raised your eyebrows upon reading the title. First, let me give a bit of background about myself so you all can see where I'm coming from. I'll make it short. 

I'm a 20-year-old guy (browsing MFA for 5 years or so now) who came out as transgender and started hormones. I'm only about 4 months in, so I'm very early in my transition. Speaking purely from a pragmatic POV, I'm still a guy. My body hasn't changed all that much yet, so my proportions are still relatively the same. I'm still 5'9"" (175 cm), still built slim, still 145 lbs (65.77 kg) or so, and still have pretty average male proportions.

Obviously, I've started expanding my wardrobe recently and I've been getting a lot of my clothing the same way I normally would. I buy Uniqlo, I thrift frequently, I use all the MFA-Approved^^tm online shops if I need new items. I generally opt for a more gender-neutral style, so I've been trying on basic clothing such as button-ups, t-shirts, hoodies, etc. What I've found is that, at least for slim men, women's clothing fits a lot better than men's clothing to the point where it's noticeable to both myself and the people around me.

Let me give a more practical example: **dress shirts**. I've bought the slim-cut Uniqlo button-up, along with many other dress shirts over the years, but they've always felt off. The shoulders are a bit too wide for me, the arms are never quite the right length and width, and the vertical cut often leaves a lot of excess fabric on the sides, making tucked shirts look awkward and poofy. The cotton usually feels stiff and less breathable than I would like, leading to stiff movement and a lot of back sweat. 

I've recently switched to wearing female blouses sized up one. Nothing really feminine at all, just your standard dress shirt, only they're usually much softer than their male counterparts, are way more breathable, and are cut slimmer. The extra room that would be used for breasts just goes up a bit, making my shoulders look wider at first glance. If anything, it makes me look more masculine. Instead of having to shove extra fabric down into my pants like a 9th grader wearing his first suit, blouses are built to be form-fitting as-is, making tucking in your shirt much easier and more comfortable.

So, what does all of this mean, exactly? Well, it's kind of made me realize how much fashion is purely marketing BS and should not be taken at face value. I used to walk directly to the men's section in every single clothing store because I naturally assumed that men's clothes automatically look better on men. Now, instead of heading directly to the men's section, I find myself having much more fun by being able to look at what each piece of clothing has to offer and judging it on its own merits, rather than writing off >50% of a store's stock. 

Does this mean that you need to walk into H&M and put on a floral dress? Well, no, not unless you genuinely want to. What I *am* saying is that, especially if you're a slim guy who struggles to find clothes that perfectly fit, maybe take a neutral looking blouse into the dressing room and see if you like the fit more, that's all. Fashion is all about experimentation and there's no shame in putting something back on the rack if you dislike it. The store owners won't tackle you, the teenager checking you out couldn't care less, and almost nobody notices in the first place. Allowing myself to freely peruse stores without limitation, while it may be a bit awkward at first, is ultimately liberating and has helped me expand my sense of fashion by finding more unique pieces!

If you've read this far, then thank you. I don't know what I hope to gain by posting this, but I felt the urge to regardless. I'm a lot happier now and this has always been one of my favorite communities on Reddit, so I hope everyone had a safe holiday and here's to a new decade!"|SilverMars|False|https://redd.it/ei8o8i|33|0.62|0|20|1|malefashionadvice

ei64ck|2019-12-31 17:44:52|Thursday Boot Co. Captains in Arizona Adobe|"Before I begin, I’d like to let you all know i am just a teen, and I don’t know much about boots as this is my first over $100 boot. So take this with a pinch of salt if it isn’t the best. This is my first review of any kind as well. And here are [the pictures!](https://imgur.com/gallery/mhJtsO8) My dog seems to approve. I’ve made this because I myself would’ve liked to see more reviews on these boots when I was deciding to ask for these or not, so for those of you who were in my situation, I hope you like these if you buy em!

Size/intro: Hello! For Christmas, I asked for a pair of Thursday Boots, specifically a Black Matte Captain pair in size 7.5 (I wear a size 8 in Vans), but they were too big. I returned them for another Captain in size 7 in the Arizona Adobe colorway. If I were to buy these again, I’d size a whole size down to get a 7 again. I probably have an inch at most of room beyond the toe and my heel slips just a tiny bit, but I don’t tie these too tight either.

Comfort: As for comfort, these feel more bulkier than my vans old skools as expected because of the heel mainly. However, as I walk around in them, the leather seems to be getting less stiff and more flexible for when I take a step. Also, when my heel slips just a tiny bit, it feels like the back of the top part of my heel if being scratched a bit. This sensation is slowly going away during this day that I’m walking around after the unboxing. I’ll definitely be able to jog in these and walk comfortably, although the heel will make it feel a bit strange as I’m used to running in my vans.

Appearance: Overall, both boots didn’t have any flaws that stood out in terms of the leather. And, yes, they both did have 7 eyelets on each side. There were a couple scuff/scratch marks on the leather, but I don’t mind them because I’d probably get marks just like those after some time anyway. I wasn’t too happy with the Black Matte color way as I realized it didn’t fit well into my wardrobe, but I am happy with the Arizona Adobe colorway because the brown looks rich to me. I don’t have pictures of the Black Matte colorway, sorry! The shoe is creasing as I take steps but it doesn’t look bad to me.

Color: As for the color of the boots compared to the website, I’d say both color ways were darker in real life than they looked on the website, but that might be a case by case scenario. The browns seem to be much more beautiful than the black ones though.

Conclusion: I think I’ll love these boots as they’re feeling better and better just in this one day I have them and I’ll have to make some outfits soon. For the price of this entry level boot, I’d recommend it. 

If there’s something I forgot, let me know and I’ll try to answer it."|opening1|False|https://redd.it/ei64ck|33|0.89|0|17|1|malefashionadvice

Dec 12: contacted Corter via Instagram 

Dec 13: Payment sent/ordered saddle tan bifold guaranteeing Christmas delivery, Corter specifically stating he would ship items on the following week (week of 16-21 Dec)

Dec 23: Never received shipping notification, so contacted Corter through IG asking for tracking number. He responded saying that it shipped & that I would get a tracking number in the morning.

Dec 24, 25th, 26th: Contacted each day asking about tracking, zero response. He finally responded on the 27th stating there were USPS issues and offered replacement wallet to be shipped in the morning while the issue was worked out. I replied immediately stating that I would like a replacement wallet, and denied the refund.

Dec 28th: inquired again, no response.

Dec 29th: inquired again, no response.

Dec 30: Corter- “Hey there! Very sorry, we had to make you another I thought we had one ready to go It'll ship in the AM!”

Dec 31st: inquired again, asking if it ever shipped.

I hesitated creating this post, because I know he does have a large following. But the lack of customer service has been frustrating. As you can see, there have been poor response times, meanwhile he was active on IG story/even posting discount codes for more orders without fulfilling mine. Additionally, He told me that it would ship TWICE/tracking number would be sent, replacement wallet would be sent/etc. without following through. I hate to question anyone’s integrity but I doubt the wallet ever shipped to begin with, let alone was created (I called him out on never receiving a shipment notification via email). I just want people to know what kind of customer service to expect from Corter. This is disappointing. Especially since I ordered this for a Christmas present for my father in law. I will not support this company any further.

ei6pk6|2019-12-31 18:27:02|Nice shoes for heavy use - walking, hiking, travel, etc|"Hi MFA, looking for some advice on dressier shoes. I've scoured the sub search, and although there is some relevant info, all is fairly old, with outdated links, or probably hidden from search in the quick question threads. I have an immediate need, that is also a general need. Generally:  I am getting to a point in my life (read: I'm getting older) where I want to look presentable at all times, and would like to drop gym shoes and sneakers from my wardrobe entirely (outside of specific instances like going to the gym).

&#x200B;

Immediately, I am going to a trade show at the end of the month, followed by a couple of weeks of traveling, and am looking to only pack one pair of shoes. At the trade show (Outdoors industry), dress code will mainly be jeans or slacks, and some sort of dress shirt. I will not need to wear a suit. I will, however, need to look sharp. I will be doing some serious walking (last year I clocked 10-15 miles per day) and standing for 12+ hours per day.

&#x200B;

Following the show, I will be in Indonesia, then Japan for a couple weeks. No suit occasions there, but still need to look presentable. Also, will be doing some light hiking (nothing too intense, this is Asian hiking, so more like strolling on trails). Also, being in Asia, would prefer something that comes off and on quickly, so probably not lace up boots.

&#x200B;

Most people at the show will be wearing things like Merrils, Salomon, etc, but I really prefer something much dressier. I would love to wear my Wolverine 1000 Mile Evans, but last year they got pretty bad a couple days in. Also, not quick to put on and off, so difficult for Asia. Was looking at Timbs Bardstown Oxfords. 

&#x200B;

Any good ideas?"|FF_dork|False|https://redd.it/ei6pk6|7|0.72|0|20|1|malefashionadvice

ehy5lw|2019-12-31 04:58:26|What was your fashion journey like in the last decade?|"I caught myself reminiscing about my own progression in dressing better and was curious to hear from other peeps.I'll go first. 

I stumbled on MFA at the beginning of the year via FMF when I looking for a new winter jacket. I went from ostensibly not caring about fashion to making it a bona fide hobby. I remember beginning a nuclear wardrobe revamp tossing out my ill fitting clothes (especially polos, I fucking hated polos due to an incident that happened but thats a digression) for skinny / slim fits from H&M, F21 etc. Then came the basic bastard phase in my life when the blue OCBD, olive pants and CPs seemed like the pinnacle of fashion. The W I D E fits I saw on Waywt seemed like an uncomfortable new place when I had just gotten comfortable with my slim fits. What finally broke my misgivings were the jwa x uniqlo pants. I fell in love with the heavy taper and have been wearing it nonstop this FW. Somewhere along the way, I learnt about the basics of layering, balance, texture, details. Thats kinda where I am right now. 

I definitely feel like I have some ways to go. Color blocking sends me running for MFA guides and I still feel too intimidated to post in WAYWT threads except on Wednesdays lol. One of my plans for the next year is to explore more styles beyond the mix of minimalism / workwear that I now feel comfortable in.

So, what was your progression like? Do you have any plans for the new decade?"|maimslap|False|https://redd.it/ehy5lw|36|0.89|0|23|1|malefashionadvice

ehpuoc|2019-12-30 18:27:49|Inspo/Review of Hasan Minaj's Fashion on Patriot Act|"# Why I made this

Besides providing a comedic perspective on important subjects, Hasan has to take the cake as the single most fashionable political comedy show host. I would characterize his fashion sense as minimal basics combined with sneaker head's taste in kicks. Now that he's wrapped up the fifth volume of Patriot Act, I thought it would be cool to compile a post that puts all his fits together into one place, both for inspiration and to see if maybe people can ID some of his pieces. I'll update this post with ID/links as I or other people find them.

# Volume 1

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/ULJSWVI)

**Thoughts**

This first season saw a fantastic fashion focused episode with the Supreme episode, but overall Hasan's style seems not as put together.

**Best fit**

In episode 2 on Saudi Arabia he wears a cream colored sweater for the first time, which is one of my favorite pieces of his, and pairs it with pinstripe pants and a clean pair of shoes I really like.

**Worst fit**

One thing I really don't like are the plaid shirts he wears in episode 6 and episode 7, they look off the rack from Macy's. However the episode 6 look is redeemed slightly with the black Chelsea boots he wears, so episode 7 has the worst look in my opinion.

**Items**

Episode 5: [Jordan 3 Retro White Cement](https://stockx.com/jordan-3-retro-white-cement-2011)

Episode 7: [Nike Dunk CMFT](https://www.flightclub.com/dunk-cmft-university-red-black-white-805136)

# Volume 2

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/Ea3aFrz)

**Thoughts**

Similar to volume 1, Hasan's fashion is hit or miss although this volume is better that the first. This volume we saw some regular pieces which he wears regularly like the cream colored sweater from volume 1 episode 2, the white shoes with a stripe from volume 1 episode 2 as well, and the black Chelsea boots from volume 1 episode 7.

**Best fit**

My favorite this volume has to be what he wore in episode 1, simply because the silk green bomber is so dope. I'm not in love with the shoes, but that bomber carries the whole outfit. The other look I appreciate is from episode 2. The suede (or velvet) blue shirt jacket, with those chunky shoes looks really cool and put together. The whole thing works.

**Worst fit**

Nooo, not more plaid! Episode 3 he brought a plaid shirt back and it looks just awful. Burn that piece of clothing like H&M burns their excess inventory.

Items

Episode 6: [Air Jordan 1](https://www.nike.com/launch/t/air-jordan-1-black-white-sail-gym-red/)

# Volume 3

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/nouxurq)

**Thoughts**

This is the season where I think Hasan's style really finds its groove. Gone are the plaid shirts, its just pure drip for the whole volume. This is the volume where we see Hasan's taste in sneakers really come to the forefront as well.

**Best fit**

This is a hard one to choose. From a more streetwear POV I love episode 3's [green Helmut Lang taxi hoodie](https://www.helmutlang.com/taxi-hoodie/883389673511.html), cropped pants with the green stripe down the side, and the black shoes with a white stripe from volume 1 episode 1. In terms of my personal taste, I also love what he wore in episode 5. Those plaid pants are the bomb, and combined with a black crewneck sweater and the chunky sneakers from volume 2 episode 2 it all comes together into a look I would love to copy.

**Worst fit**

The worst this volume was definitely what he wore for episode 4. It's just a lot of color without very much purpose. The teal sweatshirt is already off putting, but when combined a salmon undershirt and neon green Nike's it comes together into a pretty ugly package.

**Items**

Episode 2: [Air Max 90 Triple White (maybe)](https://stockx.com/air-max-90-triple-white), [Todd Snyder Dip-Dyed Dégradé Cotton Sweater](https://www.mrporter.com/en-dk/mens/product/10375442618798929)

Episode 3: [Helmut Lang Taxi Hoodie](https://www.helmutlang.com/taxi-hoodie/883389673511.html)

Episode 6: [Nike LD Waffle Sacai Blue Multi](https://stockx.com/nike-ld-waffle-sacai-blue-multi)

# Volume 4

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/iNV7xq3)

**Thoughts**

This is the volume where Hasan broke his own mold a little bit. And by a little bit I mean a very little bit. In the cruise episode (4) he wore a button down tee which was a good change of pace, and the in the public transit episode (3) he rocked something closer to a running outfit.

**Best fit**

By far my favorite look this volume was from episode 1. The floral print sweater (which I desperately want to find) paired with the off white leather shoes looked so elegant. A close second would be what he wore in episode 4. I love the subtle black on black pattern of his button down. The look comes together because of the tan pants with the navy, white, and yellow stripe down the side and clean Air Force 1s.

**Worst fit**

Although it would be easy to pick on episode 3's look I don't think that's really fair since it's closer to running gear than a real put together look. Given that, my least favorite is episode 2's look since it's kinda boring. The interesting part of the sweater, the red and white cuff, just feels uninspired, and the white Nike's that have worked well in past looks just feel boring here.

**Items**

Episode 1: [John Smedley Sea Island Cotton Crew in Navy](https://www.toddsnyder.com/products/john-smedley-sonda-pine-jacquard-ls-crew-navy-1?utm_source=cpc&utm_medium=google_shopping&utm_campaign=regular_shopping&gclid=CjwKCAiA3abwBRBqEiwAKwICA_eMCFHB1kF0E0MLJi-szz0Dm_Da2Ti1E9cEzvyHE33MtbvpAF4kURoCVpIQAvD_BwE)

Episode 2: [Air Force 1](https://www.nike.com/t/air-force-1-07-mens-shoe-JkTGzADv/315122-111)

Episode 5: [Air Max 1/97 Sean Wotherspoon](https://stockx.com/nike-air-max-1-97-sean-wotherspoon-na)

# Volume 5

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/0I7slGu)

**Thoughts**

This is the volume where Hasan became the best dressed political comedy host. Every episode had absolutely killer looks, and it was this volume that made me decide I had to put those post together. Additionally we got a few bonus looks since he did a lot of interviews this volume. He did interview Bernie in a plaid shirt, but given Bernie's working class support I suppose that is excusable.

**Best fit**

Covering fast fashion, I'm sure Hasan knew he had to come out drippin, and he certainly did. Episode 3's look is so fire. That white sweater I love with the pink wool coat looks awesome. The deep red on his shoes pairs so nicely with the lighter colored pink, and the brown pants separating the two balances the look perfectly. I'm not sure if I would wear this look (especially on an everyday basis), but for the special occasion that calls for something a little more original this look delivers.

**Worst fit**

Episode 2 is definitely the worst this volume, simply because it's way too boring. A jean jacket, blue button down, and pants the color of salmonella shit? I'll pass on that one and Hasan should have too.

**Items**

Episode 3: [Italian Boucle Knit Shirt Jacket in Mauve](https://www.toddsnyder.com/collections/outerwear/products/italian-boucle-knit-shirt-jacket-mauve)

ehg79v|2019-12-30 03:11:49|How to properly read a brannock device? (Have I been wearing my shoes wrong?)|"Hello MFA. 

I wear a size 13 shoe. I recently went to a shoe store to get my feet measured with a Brannock device and [this is what I found](http://imgur.com/a/uWPqCyY). It looks like I'm about a 12 C instead of being a size 13 D that I always thought. On the scale of widths, a C is considered narrow (while D is normal, E is wide, etc). 

I thought I was going crazy until I tried on all of my New Balance 990v5 shoes in varied sizes;

Size 13 have been sufficient in width but much too long.

Size 12 are almost a bit too short and MUCH too
narrow.

Size 12.5 are still too narrow but long enough.

What I'm getting at is that I believe that I'm either

-A) reading the Brannock improperly. I've heard that the common person cannot read the measurements properly, and is therefore 2 times likely to be wearing shoes that are too small 

-B) I'm overly sensitive to shoe widths. If I'm a 12 C and I can't even fit a 12.5 properly, something must be wrong?

What am I doing wrong; are my feet in fact wide? Any
suggestions? Any and all help is appreciated. Thanks!"|pseudobans|False|https://redd.it/ehg79v|158|0.93|0|50|1|malefashionadvice

- All listings **must** be posted from reputable platforms like Grailed, Ebay, Depop, Poshmark, etc. 

- All transactions are to be conducted through these sites. If you go offsite, you do so at your own risk.

- **All disputes should be handled through Grailed/Ebay/Paypal.**
__________________________________

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers. 

- Ask for measurements if there aren't any. Tag sizes vary wildly. 

If you want to do a trade: 

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection."|AutoModerator|False|https://redd.it/ehooj1|5|0.8|0|21|1|malefashionadvice
eh79x2|2019-12-29 15:41:17|How can I develop ‘office wear’ to stop looking like the rest of the guys in my school?|"My school’s dress code is  ‘office wear’ and I’m looking for more options other than just a shirt and dress pants. We’re not allowed to wear polo shirts or jeans/chinos so at a glance it seems like we’re very limited in what we can wear. A majority of all males in my school look the exact same clothes-wise due to the restrictions enforced by the school so I’m looking for different outfits to wear.


I’m mainly looking for ‘office’ appropriate jackets/coats, shirts and pants with different styles so I can stop looking the same every day. Wearing the exact same style of pant and shirt gets boring and old very quickly. I’d love to hear about different ways to style the clothing as well.


Footwear-wise I’m also looking to find more options, at the moment I wear Chelsea boots but I’m interested in styles of loafer/ dress shoe or any other office appropriate shoe. I’m open to different styles and materials too.


I’m not opposed to any colour, I would just rather non-distracting colours (no bright greens/yellows/oranges, etc) 


For reference I live in the U.K. so we have clear, distinct seasons. So sweater options for the winter/fall would be good.

eh8t5i|2019-12-29 17:43:17|Is There Any Point In Investing In Classic Menswear In 2020?|Hi friends. As we’re approaching the start of a new decade, I’m starting to reassess my current clothing style and situation. Over the past decade (and more) we’ve seen the transition from classic menswear to streetwear and smart casual for the general public in metropolitan areas (NYC, LA, London, etc). In addition, we’ve seen a similar shift from classic leather strap watches (traditional Pateks, etc.) to stainless steel sports watches (Rolex, nautilus, etc) to better fit the more casual transition in clothing. I’m wondering where folks think we’re heading in the future? I used to think perhaps we’d have a transition back to classic menswear but this doesn’t seem to be the case. Everything is becoming more casual and more practical. Fewer people are working traditional jobs, in traditional offices, requiring traditional clothing and accessories. I just don’t see how that reverses back to where we started. As we head into the new year, I’m now questioning whether it makes sense to continue investing in high-end trousers, proper fitting dress shirts, etc. as this may be the look of a dinosaur of the past (apart from a few special occasions).

egwia0|2019-12-28 21:25:16|Honey, I Shrunk the Schott|"*DISCLAIMER: I'm not advocating this as a sure-fire method of resizing your jacket, it's just a fun little DIY project I thought might be interesting to share.*

**Background**

About 6 months ago, my parents bought me a Schott Perfecto I had been eyeing on TheRealReal for my birthday. It was a perfect jacket: super thick and soft black steer hide, in near brand new condition, and for a steal of a price! The only problem was that it was a little too big for me. Rather than do the sensible thing and return it, I kept it thinking I could make it work in an oversized kind of way. While I've had some success [layering it](http://imgur.com/a/dBme3Wk) to take up space, I haven't been able to wear it daily as it's too boxy with just a tee and jeans. So again, rather than do the sensible thing and try and recoup my loss on Grailed, I decided to wash the jacket in the hopes of shrinking it! 

**The Process**

[Picture Album](http://imgur.com/a/jiozkAC) 

I did my research and found [several](http://helloblackbird.blogspot.com/2009/07/washing-your-leather-jacket-by-peter.html?m=) [sources](http://www.stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showthread.php?12109-I-WASHED-MY-CCP-FENCING-LEATHER-DO-NOT-TRY-THIS-AT-HOME-) [with info](http://www.stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showthread.php?11700-Machine-washing-and-drying-a-leather-jacket) on washing leather jackets, but mostly based my experiment off a post written here by u/eqqy some time ago. Feeling confident I could achieve some sort of result, I gave it a try. 

* 1) First, I thoroughly conditioned the jacket with Lexol and let it sit for several hours to avoid drying the jacket out during the wash.
* 2) I filled my bathtub with warm water, enough to submerge the whole jacket. Let it soak for about 20-30 mins, occasionally turning it over and gently working the leather. The hotter the water the more shrinkage. 
* 3) Then came the drying. I drained the water and then squeezed all the excess out of the jacket before sticking it in my dryer with some old towels. I used high heat for 70 mins, taking it out every 10 mins to check on the fit and to tug on the zippers. 
* 4) Once the jacket had achieved the level of shrinkage I wanted I removed it from the dryer and hung it up to air dry. This should help it drape a little more naturally. Occasionally I'd go and ""re-shape"" the jacket to get the drape right and remove any bulges. 
* 5) After letting it dry overnight, I applied some more Lexol to restore the leather. 

**Results**

[Before and After](http://imgur.com/a/dz1ji87) 

The wash was a success in my book! The whole jacket shrank down about a whole size, and has a cool texture now thanks to the washing. So far the only issue I have is that the shoulder gussets are a bit stiff, so they flare out some when I wear it. I'm hoping this dissipates with wear and conditioning. The leather seems to have held up alright too. No signs of cracking/blistering or any damage to the color. 

**Afterthoughts**

I'm very happy with how my jacket turned out! It was relatively easy, and the results were exactly what I was hoping for. That being said, if anyone else wants to follow this guide, I'll echo what others have said in the resources I linked, and what I learned doing this. 

* Effect on Zippers/Lining: Assuming your jacket shrinks, the zippers and lining of your jacket won't shrink with it. The zippers will have a wavy look as they pull against the leather. The lining will similarly sag, which isn't a huge issue unless you shrink too much, in which case the lining may show when you wear the jacket. A tailor should be able to fix that though.

* Effect on Leather: The leather will take on a much duller sheen after the washing, and may feel a bit more dry. Conditioning before and after should help prevent this. In addition, the grain of your jacket may become more pronounced. All this varies of course with the leather type, what kind of treatments it's undergone beforehand, and variables during the wash like water/dryer temperature and time. 

* Fit: Aside form the zippers and lining, the jacket will shrink EVERYWHERE. I wouldn't recommend this if your jacket is just big in one area, for instance if the sleeves are too long (my jacket seemed to experience the most shrinkage in the torso). In that case I'd say take it to a good leather alterations shop or try and find one that fits better. I'd say this only works if you're looking to shrink the jacket allover and if it's already fairly close to your size."|fluxknot|False|https://redd.it/egwia0|116|0.88|0|37|1|malefashionadvice

egn5bo|2019-12-28 06:06:49|From a Canadian: do you want a budget parka that's actually warm? Just get the Eddie Bauer Superior Down Parka.|"Saw the Budget parka thread the other day. Everyone's style is different, but if you're looking for warmth, please just buy the superior down parka from eddie bauer.     
  

NOT the uniqlo hybrid ultra warm, NOT the abercrombie ultra parka, NOT the mcmurdo, NOT the gotham. I've tried them all. Trust me, get the Superior Down Parka. It's not close guys. You won't try on the abercrombie ultra parka, then try on the superior down parka and have to think about which one feels warmer to you. The difference is immediate and noticeable. You put the superior down parka on in the store, you're going to start sweating within the minute.  
  

It will probably be the warmest parka you've ever worn in your life. It's also less than $200 depending on the sale. It's essentially just a shitload of 650 fill down stuffed into the shape of a parka. 650 fill is the same as canada goose jackets but arguably even better because cg uses duck and eb uses goose down (more expensive). Eddie Bauer rates it good up to -40 degrees and I believe it, it's insanely warm. If you wear it at -20 with a tshirt underneath don't walk too fast or you'll sweat.  
  

Don't get anything else if you're looking for a warm budget parka. Just please get the Superior Down Parka, thanks."|bypurple|False|https://redd.it/egn5bo|111|0.93|0|33|1|malefashionadvice

egggup|2019-12-27 20:33:21|Brands to Watch in 2020|"As we roll in to the new year, I thought it would be nice to have a post about brands to watch in 2020.  Most of these labels you have probably heard of, and several have been around for quite a few years.  For one reason or another, I expect that their popularity will increase significantly in 2020.  Here are a few of my picks.  Please share your own in the comments below:

**1. Bode** - Emily Bode's eponymous label took flight several years ago but really hit its stride in 2019.  Her penchant for creative, intensely personal (and sometimes fully customizable pieces) has resonated with fans like A$AP Ferg, who calls it an ""American Visvim.""  Over 75 stores now stock the brand, and Emily herself was recently named GQ's 2019 Designer of the Year.

**2. Kaptain Sunshine** - Though there is already a crowded landscape of Japanese workwear/field/repro brands, Kaptain Sunshine excels among its competition.  Most of the pieces offered come in neutral tones and standard cuts with interesting details, but the fabrics transcend standard, however.  Just see the staple [Traveller Coat](https://www.namu-shop.com/collections/kaptain-sunshine/products/kaptain-sunshine-traveller-coat-khaki-brown), constructed from Super 140s Melton Wool.  The label was also recently dubbed by StyleForum voters as the best up-and-coming brand, despite having been around since 2013.

**3.  Marine Serre** - Serre launched her first line in SS19 after tenures at big houses like Dior and Balenciaga.  Serre sought to be a professional tennis player but abandoned that direction in favor of fashion.  Her resulting menswear work is heavily influenced by modern and vintage sportswear.  If you're in need of a tie-dye silk sweatsuit, look no further.

**4.  Jacquemus** - Simon Porte Jacquemus is one of the rare self-taught designers whose vision actually makes sense.  The label has transitioned into an oddball mixture of relaxed French tailoring, pocket-laden workwear, and funky, retro pieces."|BeneficialMovie|False|https://redd.it/egggup|63|0.81|0|37|1|malefashionadvice

eg0vv3|2019-12-26 20:58:37|What is the modern (well-dressed) men's solution for carrying stuff daily?|"That's one issue that's been preoccupying me for a while. I see this as a complex issue because it a) depends very much on fit with personal style, age, etc, and b) it's about discovering the different perspectives on it. Not only that, I would find it really interesting to see where different cultural perspectives differ (I'm sure different types of bags would evoke different stereotypes in the US compared to Central Europe).


So what do MFA people use to... well... carry stuff around? I mean posing in your suit from Savile Row and Edward Green boots is all fine until you realize you gotta carry a backpack for all your stuff to fit. Perhaps I'm too middle-class to realise that I shouldn't need to carry stuff around (because that's what your Jaguar's trunk is for, duh).


But really, what are some good, stylish and/or elegant options to carry a daily amount of stuff that doesn't quite fit in pockets, but doesn't warrant a full weekender bag or so? 



So far I've observed:

- stuffing everything into your pockets. Admittedly guilty of that myself in winter, but then winter jackets are large enough not to bulge from that. Doesn't really work for temperatures over 5C due to lighter clothes.

- the backpack, or the local down-to-earth dad's choice. Whether bankers or engineers, a massive amount of people over 40 seems to carry one, and it's just... sigh. A backpack.

- messenger bags: depending on the make, either the ""I don't care"" student's option, or the young professional who doesn't want to succumb to age and to the temptation of the backpack. I am forced to use those as I haven't found anything better, but they're actually not that comfortable.

- classic briefcase: not to mention the old stuff one, even the more modern briefcases got very rare here, found only in the hands of much older, conservatively dressed gentlemen, or very pretentious young ones. I personally find most of them both too stiff and impractical.

- the small over-the-shoulder messenger/purse: or the Eastern European option, best paired with black leather sandals and socks (I'm allowed to freely make fun of that due to my own origins). If I'm completely honest, from the point of view of size and carrying capacity, it is the best option (enough space for a thick wallet, notepad, tablet, and a charger or something). But: it doesn't look great and it actually destroys some fabrics due to friction.


And then there are of course the other things like fanny packs... yeah...


I'm wondering if there are any other options? Something that really bridges the gulf between looking good and being practical?


I guess really smart backpacks could be good for some cases? They work decently well for women, but I personally really hate any kind of backpack with any kind of dressy clothes. It's like there has to be a Peak Design type of 'breakthrough' with dressy variants. Or maybe there would be a hybrid option, like a soft leather briefcase with shoulder belt..."|xMisterVx|False|https://redd.it/eg0vv3|748|0.94|0|371|1|malefashionadvice

efuhaj|2019-12-26 11:37:55|Battle of the Budget Parkas: Review of Abercrombie and Fitch's ULTRA PARKA vs Uniqlo's HYBRID ULTRA DOWN PARKA|"This won't be a technical review, there's a lot of information on these products that I can't find out, such as the down fill power, etc. It's just going to be based on my own experiences

[Abercrombie Parka left, Uniqlo Parka right](https://i.imgur.com/7DWOwAX.jpg)

These two Parka's not only have a similar name, but come at the same price range too, around $100-200. With the year end sales coming soon, I believe in the US the Abercrombie parka can be as low as $125.  the Uniqlo should come around the same price range

**FEEL**

The exterior of the Uniqlo feels like the typical polyester/nylon style down coat with a matte finish

the Abercrombie on the other hand feels more cotton like and less synthetic.

**WARMTH**

I also have a North Face DefDown Parka, and in the past the North Face McMurdo and Gotham.  I would say these two are not as warm, but pretty close.  You can probably mitigate this with a layer of heattech undershirts and save money, as the North Face can cost twice or thrice as much as these budget parkas

**WEIGHT**

The Uniqlo is definitely lighter, while the Abercrombie is noticeably heavier.  In fact it feels heavier than the North Face

**HOOD**

Both use faux fur hoods and both are detachable.  The Uniqlo uses snap buttons, while the Abercrombie uses buttons that are hidden under a polyester layer.  The Abercrombie hood is fully lined with faux shearling making the hood warmer. the Abercrombie 'fur' is also fluffier.

One thing to notice is that the collars are very different.  On the Abercrombie, the hood and collar are separate pieces, so the collar (which is quite high and also shearling lined) can be zipped up to your chin while the hood stays down.  The Uniqlo collar and hood are one piece (they are also unlined). Thus the way the hood rests differs.  the Uniqlo one rests behind your head while the Abercrombie one rests closer to your shoulder.

[Abercrombie left, Uniqlo right](https://i.imgur.com/runxsbN.jpg?1)

**WIND AND WATER**

The Abercrombie is advertised as water resistant and windproof. the Uniqlo is advertised as water repelling and wind proof.  Unfortunately during the time I had them, I could not test them in rainy conditions.  The Abercrombie however handles wind better. This is because the front zipper has a cover flap, while it has a ton of draw strings all around the hood and body to create a better seal

**ZIPPER**

The Abercrombie uses a double zipper system for the front, which is then covered by an overlapping flap that uses buttons and is lined with corduroy.   The Uniqlo uses a single zipper that has rubber like coating to reduce wind entry while its flap is noticeably smaller. Both are not without its flaws, getting the Abercrombie zip end into both zippers is a pain in the arse.  While the Uniqlo Zipper sometimes gets caught in the black rubber parts.  Ultimately the Abercrombie one, as said earlier, feels more windproof because of the extra flap as well as giving you options for zip or button use

**POCKETS**

the Uniqlo has two hand warmers on the chest, two large pockets, and an internal pocket.

the Abercrombie has FOUR hand warmers, two on the chest, and two behind the two large pockets!  it also has an internal pocket

The Uniqlo pockets are held together with one button, while the Abercrombie has two buttons for each pocket while the internal pocket uses a zipper.

[Abercrombie pockets etc (sorry the top left is the Uniqlo, added it by accident)](https://i.imgur.com/QNImCmB.jpg)

[Uniqlo pockets (note that it uses a single button closure)](https://i.imgur.com/0JAJiIJ.jpg)

&#x200B;

**LEAKAGE**

all down coats and jackets leak but unfortunately I noticed the Abercrombie seems a bit more leaky than the Uniqlo

**VERDICT**

Both are probably the best budget parka in the $100-200 range you can get imho.

But between the two I would choose the Abercrombie simply because it has more handwarmers and a nice cozy faux shearling lined collar and hood.  In fact these little details made me choose it over the North Face too.  Unfortunately the Zippers do get annoying as well as concerns over the leakage.

The Uniqlo is noticeably lighter, so if that's a concern, go for the Uniqlo. I believe all of the Abercrombie additions such as the shearling, more buttons, sturdier zippers, etc add to the overall weight."|LeBronBryantJames|False|https://redd.it/efuhaj|543|0.95|0|76|1|malefashionadvice

Price: $650 USD (I paid \~$1000 CAD after taxes in Canada) 

&#x200B;

**Design and fit:**

This coat is single breasted, peak lapel, single vented, with three buttons. 

The fit is similar to the Brooks Brothers Regent fit. I’m a size 40 with a regent fit suit (I wear size 42 with Canali and Hugo Boss), and I bought a size 40 for this coat. There’s a little bit of room in the shoulders, and I can squeeze in a suit underneath. However, if you would like to regularly wear it with a suit, you probably want to size up 1 size.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Materials and construction:**

The Brooks Brothers website calls this coat a navy, “super soft” coat. When I first saw it in person, I nearly laughed at how inaccurate it is. Close up, under brighter light, the coat is nearly a royal blue. The material is also very, very rough looking if you look closely. It doesn’t seem “navy super soft” at first glance. 

In slightly less harsh lighting however, the color does appear significantly darker. In day to day wear, this coat looks just a hair lighter than navy. The material is also shockingly soft and comfortable. I would actually say it is one of, if not the single most comfortable overcoat I’ve worn in a long time. The texture isn’t smooth, but it is ridiculously soft. The construction is fine, and even going over it closely, I cannot find any flaws. The interior is unlined (only the sleeves are lined)

&#x200B;

Interior shot: [https://i.imgur.com/JwnKnfm.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/JwnKnfm.jpg)

&#x200B;

**What is this coat like to live with?**

The coat is quite heavy, and very, very warm. However, due to its non-lined design, the coat is quite breathable. I can wear this coat all day indoors without really breaking a sweat.  This coat is so soft, it feels like I’m wearing a Snuggie. The pockets are very big and usable (easily fits a bottle of water and a phone). Due to its softness and flexibility, I can comfortably wear this coat sitting down.

For instance, here’s my lazy boxing day outfit. I didn’t overheat with this coat on all day in a busy mall:

[https://i.imgur.com/CQyJCJa.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/CQyJCJa.jpg)

&#x200B;

**Conclusion and Value:**

Brooks Brothers has created a very unique coat in my opinion. This coat is quite different than most top coats on the market, and I haven't really been able to find a similar point at a similar price point. 

Would I recommend this coat? I think it is a fantastic choice, and although the price is a bit high, I think it is reasonable for a coat of this quality. Brooks Brothers allows you to order the coat in store with no obligation to buy, so if you’re looking for a new topcoat, why don’t you give this one a shot?"|Uptons_BJs|False|https://redd.it/eg551g|20|0.95|0|6|1|malefashionadvice
eg12m0|2019-12-26 21:13:17|Androgyny in Manly Men|"Hi Friends, 

&#x200B;

I am a man who is in my early 30's, skinny, beardy, shaved head (and balding; it looks great short, but I can't grow it out) and not very muscled (although I think my frame makes me look slightly more athletic than I am). I'll start by saying that I am bisexual and find androgyny in both men and women very sexy. I've been on a quest lately to discover my own 'sexy' style to give me some more pep in my step, and I'm having some trouble! I have facial hair, you see, and I really, really like it. All in all, I look a bit gruff in the face. 

&#x200B;

What I'm looking for is some advice on how to balance androgyny with my otherwise masculine facial features. I have seen others who have done it, and to be quite honest, the common element in those I have seen is that they are all VERY attractive men who could likely pull off almost anything. While I think I'm a pretty damn sexy man myself, I'm still very much a normal looking person.

&#x200B;

If anyone has some advice on how I, a somewhat masculine middle-aged man with a beard, can achieve that androgynous look I'm interested in, I would be very, very grateful!"|ChoopAdoop|False|https://redd.it/eg12m0|15|0.66|0|19|1|malefashionadvice

On Dec 17 I went into a Bonobos store near my office to place an order for 2 daily grind shirts, as well as a blazer. About a half hour later I checked my email for my order confirmation and realized that the guide placed an order for 2 jet setters, so I immediately called to correct the order. He cancelled the order for the jet setters (which I received a refund for) and placed an order for the daily grinds instead. 

2 days later I received the shipment for the jet setters, and then the following Monday I received the daily grinds. I received a cancellation email for the jet setters and never got a shipping/tracking email, so I am wondering if I will at some point be charged again for the jet setters unless I send them back. I certainly wouldn’t mind 2 free shirts but If I’m going to be charged I’d rather send them back.

efvinw|2019-12-26 13:38:43|Fashion Help|"So I’m 17 and I just started to get into fashion. I just usually wear hoodies, sweaters, graphic tees; as for pants I wear cotton sweatpants and joggers. My height is 5”6 (yes, not that tall). 

I’m from the Philippines and temperate here can get up to 32°C, so whenever it’s hot outside I just wear my tees; as when it’s cool outside I wear my hoodies and sweaters. 

I feel like hoodies and sweaters are a bit tad too much, considering the weather here. I’m not entirely sure what streetwear is, but I do want to get into it.
I also see trends on techwear, where there are like cargo joggers with straps on it? When is it appropriate to wear them?

I only got into liking fashion in my early 17s, so I’m still quite new to this. I used to just wear jeans, shorts, and whatever shirt I had.  I read that short guys shouldn’t go for oversized clothes, as it makes us look shorter, and I kind of agree.

I also want to get into wearing jackets, like denim or bomber jackets. What other types are there? Are they okay for my height (5”6)? 

I also need help to get rid of my acne. I’m not sure what to apply to my face.  I also got acne scars because of me “pinching” or popping” pimples.

It seems like for the most part, outerwear is an afterthought for most guys and most brands that make them. Buying outerwear from a store where it's not their bread and butter seems wrong. It feels like most people just buy their (non-technical) outerwear from wherever they buy the rest of their clothes, like J Crew, Bonobos etc.

The only brand name outerwear that I ever see come up is either Barbour, Baracuta, or Alpha Industries. Am i missing something? It feels weird that there aren't really any brands that lead on outerwear and it seems most people don't have a brand they trust for non-tech outerwear."|Unusual_Sandwich|False|https://redd.it/efzv8x|10|0.81|0|25|1|malefashionadvice

efmuu4|2019-12-25 22:33:59|Help me stop being the most boringly dressed person in the room - 19YO.|"For the majority of my life, I have been dressing in what I understand would fit generally under an MFA uniform or similar. My typical wear is a grey/black hoodie, black or dark blue jeans and casual sneakers - Adidas Gazelle Navy etc. (not dad sneakers, or modern white sneakers).

I consider the style to be very boring and very conservative (stems from lack of confidence in earlier years). If I have to classify it, it would fit under streetwear (i.e. casual) but at the very, very conservative end.

At heart, I have always enjoyed the preppy look - nice and thick cardigans, polo shirts, chinos, trousers, ties, formal shirts, formal-ish shoes etc. On the more casual end perhaps sweatpants with a t-shirt and some type of top garment (not a hoodie for sure). [Example.](https://www.fromthemovie.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Nike-Cortez-Shoes-Wolf-Wallstreet.jpg) [Example 2.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f7/af/9e/f7af9e0b6436180aa4b8f11c5a3b82e4.jpg) [Example 3.](https://cf.ltkcdn.net/mens-fashion/images/std/217444-674x450-man-in-tucked-in-polo-shirt.jpg) I do enjoy wearing the odd button-down shirt, tucked in or with a jumper, still with the same shoes. I have been, however,  told that I look like a 'dad' and that was when I was only wearing a jumper with a shirt showing the collar. 

It certainly doesn't seem to be appealing to people my age - the majority of them wearing what I would classify as midlevel streetwear - slim-fitting white t-shirt, jumper on top (if worn), slim blue jeans or sweatpants and white sneakers. [Example.](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/6f/44/28/6f4428aaae89142e0dbf8890bfab9b53--mens-fashion-blog-fashion-blogs.jpg) [Example 2.](https://static.zara.net/photos///2020/V/0/2/p/4087/401/800/2/w/392/4087401800_2_1_1.jpg?ts=1574680937324) The other part probably being pushed to higher-level streetwear - dad sneakers, branded jumpers, majority of sweatpants. I'm in the UK. 

Now regarding my own views, I can't say that I feel like I would fit in any of the previously described looks. I would never wear sweatpants in public - I have been taught that way and in my eyes, it is just sloppy. I cannot wear skinny clothing - I am on the larger side. I am not a fan of white sneakers either - they seem almost too trendy for me. I like being a little bit different and internationally not trendy but currently, that is in a boring way. Being preppy makes me stand out too much and I fell like I am simply too young for it. I imagine myself fitting perfectly once I am 30 but at 20 it just looks a tad off. Trying to fit in modern trends would be my best bet I guess but it is just not 'me'.

My wardrobe is getting smaller and smaller to the point in which currently I wear a grey zip hoodie, t-shirt (non-visible), black jeans (large legs) and the blue gazelles 6 of 7 days a week - no exaggeration. At this point I would ask you what to buy to start changing my style - the problem is that I don't know what style to transition into. If I was to think in a vacuum I'd say that is preppy which would require a very slow transition as the change is big. 

I want to buy some new pieces of clothing but not sure what? Also, what would be your advice on how/if I should change/improve my current 'style'? Clothes will be bought from most basic and cheap shop as I am losing weight and clothes from last year don't fit me, also I'd like to experiment with cheap clothing until I find something that suits me."|throwawayforphenibut|False|https://redd.it/efmuu4|28|0.77|0|34|1|malefashionadvice

* END - $585 CAD - [Common Projects Achilles Premium](https://www.endclothing.com/ca/common-projects-achilles-low-premium-2045-0506.html)
* SSENSE - $485 CAD - [Common Projects Achilles Low](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/common-projects/white-achilles-low-sneakers/4034201?gclid=Cj0KCQiArozwBRDOARIsAHo2s7thyIZdm1kAF--AV1_kSARQVNWeoEyz9jp0rd0r-K6wWeCgXAXe2foaAn0mEALw_wcB)
* SSENSE - $595 CAD - [Common Projects Original Achilles Low](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/common-projects/white-original-achilles-low-sneakers/3639679)

The specs on all the shoes seem to be the same: Margom soles, leather upper/lining. As stated above, the Premium says to be using full-grain leather, and the grain is a lot more prominent than the other versions. Does this mean the other models use top/corrected grain leathers? I own a pair of BBall lows myself, and the leather is pretty supple and the grain is visible on the leather's surface. However, considering you can get Full Grain leather uppers from many alternative brands (Koio, Greats), the ""regular"" Achilles Low seems like a scam if they're not full-grain uppers and lining. Also, why is there a ""regular"" line and an ""Original"" line? The model numbers match and they look identical in the pictures. What are the differences between them?

This is strange because Common Projects are supposed to be the standard for white sneakers, so having 3 distinct lines confuses me to which I should be purchasing. Does anybody know anything in the differences and whether or not the Premium/Original warrants the \~$100 price difference?"|1298se|False|https://redd.it/efnlg7|9|0.72|0|5|1|malefashionadvice

Long time lurker on this page. Just a little bit about me, I'm a sneaker freaker (jordans/nike/adidas) and now slowly I'm changing my style in clothing to settle for things less streetwear but more 'gentlemen'-ish. I own 3 other pairs of white sneakers (Common Project, Greats, Axel Arigato and Adidas Stan Smith) and I will be slight comparing them. With a word of warning, I did decide to write this review due to my experience with them and I hope you guys get something out of this.

Anyway, this is my review for the Oliver Cabell Low 1. Here we go!

\----------------------

**Ease of Purchase 4/5)**  
Very easy, quick as well. Online purchase from their website, filled in the form, they accept PAYPAL and Credit Card. Got my purchase confirmation instantly and also my Shipping Confirmation in a few day (it went to my Junk Mail).

**Delivery (4/5)**  
As I'm located in Australia, it usually takes a week to have anything delivered from overseas, safe to say that the courier did it's job and that the item took slightly longer than a week but its all ok.

**Packaging (5/5)**  
Looks very premium at first, with a double box and comes with a shoe bag, which is perfect for travels and you want to bring these shoe a long. Helps prevents scratching and have to say, it was a nice touch.  
**Customer Service (2/5)**  
I've written to them twice, once about my shipping but I did not get a response. Another I wrote to them about an issue with my shoe (later to be covered) and they have responded within a day's time (props to that) but their response was the definition of terrible, as they tried to use a poor excuse to deflect responsibility.

\--------------------------

Now here come the main part, the shoe review:

**Material (3.5/5)**  
Advertised as Italian Calfskin Leather, you can say it is what it is as you take it out of the box. It looks nice there wasn't much I can comment as it seems like the leather is nice but given the fact that these are $240AUD (Roughly), I do think the price would have to stand up for the quality. The leather had multiple indents which I'm unsure as to how it got there in the first place, as you can see on the pictures it is very inconsistent but that being said, this wasn't too big of a issue because it feels like you're paying what you're getting (although it is extremely disappointing - not even my other shoes has this issue). The leather is grainy in certain parts (pictures in Style) and you can see that consistently around the ""flat surface"" part of the shoe.

Comparing to Adidas (Stan Smith), it has a familiar tone but definitely softer and not smell like shoe glue.

Comparing to Axel Arigato, for some reasons the pair I got had a really rough leather and much stiffer than the OB.

Comparing to Greats, the leather is harder but the look and texture is much better than the OB.

Comparing to Common Project, CP has a much softer feel and definitely smoother overall - truly gold standards.

As I'm no leather connoisseur, I can only judge these with my experience with leather.

**Comfort/Fit (4.5/5)**  
As soon as I stepped in it felt like I was good to go and the cushion seems to be just right for a low riding minimalist sneaker like this. I wouldn't say or guess you'll need much break in time but definitely might be different for everyone. I wouldnt say it would be the same as the CP but my ranking would be (CP > OB > Greats > Stan Smith > AA).  
The shoes runs small, order half a size down is my recommendation if you have wide feel (which is what I have) and the fit perfectly. I've tried lacing it in two ways and both ways are approachable if one is preferred to the other. Definitely have enough space but at the same time not enough for your feet to wobble inside as you walk, it felt great for me and I have no issues, IF my shoe was perfect which will be explained later.

**Craftmenship (1/5)**  
Now this is the area the shoe was a complete let down. As I stated that the leather had multiple indents and there were a slight scratch in the front. But what I noticed was the lacing on my Left pair is not constructed right down the middle like my Right pair. The leather cuts are completely uneven on my Left pair which lead to slightly shifted lacing and it did create a bit of a really strange pressure on top of my left foot when i walk in it. I must say this was very disappointing as not even Nike would release these shoes on a production line due to severe defect on this pair. This was terrible with the quality control and honestly even if everything else is imperfect, you should not get this part of the shoe wrong. My ranking CP > Greats > AA > Stan Smith > Shoes from Target > OB.

**Style (5/5)**  
I love the low and minimalist design. The branding is very subtle and nothing on the side of the shoe, the white is perfect and the low riding just meets the cuff by my ankles. The design is indeed very similar to CP and it does feel like it is trying to replicate itself but at the same time paying respect the gold standard, like a little brother to the CP. The outsole is just right for people who prefer it being lower to the ground as it would be similar to a pair of Converse height but not as high as Stan Smith and Greats.

[https://imgur.com/a/imiggQA](https://imgur.com/a/imiggQA)  
\-------------------------

**Overall (2/5)**  
I wish I can love it, but when they messed up the most important pair of the shoe, it is something which can turn anything gold to a pile of brown manure. I wouldn't say they are worth the price as Greats are round the corner but sadly there design is not the same, but possible go for New Republic (I do not own a pair but my friend likes his) if you want a similar design.  
For me, it was enough for me from this one transaction to safe to say that it would be a 'No' if I would ever go back to them until they step it up with their Quality Control (which seems certain for one thing now). The price just did not justify the overall experience to me, at all.

To conclude, they have potential if you got yourself a non-defected pair - so it truly feels like a lucky dip (and from the reviews, your chances are low) and Customer Services does not care after they take your money.

\-----------------------

P.S. This was there response from the Craftmenship defect:  
""Thanks for reaching out. This is due to the fact that the shoes are hand lasted. In order to ensure that the fit is perfect the leather is stretched around a last. Leather has different elasticity based on the part of the skin or the skin entirely, given that it's from a natural animal. This will cause variations in this ""gap"" to ensure there is a proper fit. I hope this makes sense. Let me know if I can be of any further help!""

I've messaged them back explaining this seems more like a manufacturing issue not a 'leather stretch issue' but haven't heard back from them ever since. I don't want to be rude but I really hope they don't treat everyone like if they don't know anything, its pretty obvious when you cut the leather incorrectly by centimeters. Leather does not stretch by centimeters like that... or at least advise for me to ship them back to review it. \*sigh"|GummmySauce|False|https://redd.it/efbbg5|30|0.91|0|8|1|malefashionadvice

I know it gets pretty damn cold, but I have no clue what I need to be looking for in terms of how to stay warm w/o looking like I'm going to the Arctic. I expect that I won't be doing too much hiking or anything like that, but I'll definitely be walking decent distances and the campus does have some pretty steep slopes. I've heard they do a pretty good job of clearing snow from the walkways, but I expect that I'll still need boots with good traction for ice.

**Price**

For the parka, probably <$400.

Boots, <$300.

**Parka**

I'm not a fan of like puffy jackets, I prefer kind of a smooth/slim design. Definitely want something to keep me warm---I've hardly even seen snow in my life. I haven't seen too many, but just to give an idea of the style I like:

* [Eddie Bauer Superior Down Parka](https://www.eddiebauer.com/p/10112068/men's-superior-down-parka?sp=1&size=&color=Black)
* [North Face Men's Gotham Jacket III](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MXMB8QG/ref=twister_B073QZZYF5?th=1&psc=1) (maybe a bit short idk?)

**Boots**

No idea what to even look for in a good pair of winter boots. I had a pair of Timberlands once when I went hiking (not even in snow) and I wasn't really into how they looked. I'd prefer kind of a low-key design. I like the [Sorel Madson Moc Toe Boots](https://www.sorel.com/madson-moc-toe-boot-1767231.html?dwvar_1767231_variationColor=245&cgid=men-boots#start=1) a lot, but I'm not sure if they are enough for upstate NY in January--would appreciate input on that or just other recommendations.

Thanks to some free time around the holidays, I’ve finally gotten around to writing a guide on my favorite footwear – the moccasin. Mocs are wonderful pieces of American heritage footwear that easily assimilate with some of the other commonly recommended pieces here on /r/mfa while still adding some flair to your outfit. Hopefully this can be a useful resource for beginners looking to branch out into a different style of casual footwear since Mocs are a nice alternative to plain sneakers or chukkas.

**A History Lesson**

“Moccasin” in English is a blanket term for the footwear of choice for indigenous groups in North America. Often fashioned from deerskin or other soft leathers and featuring a distinctive U-shaped toe stitching, the styling details of various moccasins were a reflection of the lifestyles of the tribes who wore them (soft soles for tribes in the forested northeast, hard soles for desert tribes like the Apache). These shoes were often so distinctive that some tribes could be identified by looking at their feet and a few were even named after them (the “Blackfoot” for example).

Indigenous moccasins have influenced several prominent shoe models in American (and world) fashion history. GH Bass’s popular “Weejun” penny loafer was marketed as a take on Norwegian fishermen’s footwear, but actually has its roots in a traditional Iroquois design (damn Scandinavians and their appropriation). The LL Bean laced Moc was popularized in the early 1900s as a vacation shoe for summer/fall in the Northeast. This cemented Moccasins as the leisure shoe of choice for WASPs vacationing in Maine who, in turn, brought them back to the cities and college towns of the northeast. This style became the quintessential Moccasin and supported a cottage industry of hand sewers in Maine that still survives today.  

**Why Mocs? The Construction of a Moccasin**

“True Moccasin” or “Handsewn” construction refers to a process in which one piece of leather, making up the sides and bottom of the shoe, are sewn together with another piece of leather on top that forms the vamp. This results in the iconic U shaped stitching along the top of the shoe. Typically a midsole and thin, often rubber, sole are then sewn on to the bottom of the shoe. Some shoes may use this moc style stitching while actually using a more common construction method – a goodyear welt or cemented construction for example.

This construction leads to a casual style of shoe that is supremely flexible and comfortable. Moccasins conform to the wearer’s feet faster and more completely than traditional welted footwear. I find my well-worn camp mocs to be even more comfortable than going barefoot. Handsewn shoes also have an element of personalization – the construction requires that these goods be crafted individually rather than by machine. Whether that yields any material value could be debated, but it certainly lends sentimental value. 

**Camp Moc vs Blucher Moc vs Boat Shoe vs Driver vs Loafer Mocs**

Modern Moccasin styles can be categorized using a few characteristics, but generally there is a lot of overlap between these designations and many brands offer hybrid versions that blur the line between one style or another. Generally, “camp” mocs feature only two eyelets whereas “blucher” (or “ranger”) mocs feature three or more eyelets. Boat shoes look like two eyelet moccasins but are often only decoratively stitched (a mock moc toe if you will) and feature siping patterned soles with a slight heel. Drivers are like moccasins with annoying little numbs on the bottom. Loafers are like Mocs but also totally different, so a loafer-moc is just a hybridization of two shoes that are simultaneously very similar and completely different.

For most, these can all be grouped together stylistically and substituted for one another. But for some (pretentious) purists, the differences in minor details and historical connotations provide the framework for modern wear. The biggest “rule” worth considering is that Mocs are fine with/without socks and boat shoes should be reserved for sock-less wear - although breaking this wouldn’t be considered a significant faux pas. 

**Recommendations at Varying Price Points**

- [Minnetonka](https://www.minnetonkamoccasin.com/) ($50-$100). Not terrible if you’re only looking to try out the style, but some of the leathers are pretty plastic-y and they likely won’t last more than a few seasons. 

- [LL Bean](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/10587?page=handsewn-moccasins-camp-moc&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;bc=474-629&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;feat=629-GN1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;csp=f)(~$80). While the quality of Bean’s mocs isn’t quite what it once was, the iconic shape is still there and IMO these are still worth a buy – on sale - for the budget conscious. 

- [Town View Leather](https://www.townviewleather.com/) (~$120). Their “Ole Maine Classic” is one of the lower priced options for getting a true handsewn moc from a small business. The shape is not quite my ideal, but the price is great and getting to choose the color (pick honey) + lined/unlined is a nice option.

- [Wassookeag Moccasins](https://www.wassookeagmoccasins.com/) ($125-250). Haven’t gotten to try these out personally, but they look excellent. Wassookeag focuses on soft sole mocs which ditch the rubber sole for layers of wrapped leather – arguably more comfortable and certainly more of a stylistic statement. 

- [Rancourt and Company](https://www.rancourtandcompany.com/) (~$250). Maybe the most recommended place to buy made in Maine footwear. Whether via MTO or a stocked model, Rancourt offers almost every kind of handsewn shoe in a variety of materials. Chromexcel, an oil-stuffed American leather, is their most used and is a perfect match for a moccasin.

- [Oak Street Bootmakers](https://oakstreetbootmakers.com/) (~$280). This Chicago-based operation is arguably more famous for their service boots, but they also offer several models of well made handsewns. I’d typically look at Rancourt first, but often Oak Street can be found for 20-30% off msrp, which is a great deal.

- [Quoddy](https://www.quoddy.com) (~$295). My favorite mocs – unlined Horween whiskey camp mocs w/ red sole – are Quoddys. They charge a premium, but the comfort is there. 

- [Yuketen](https://www.yuketen.com) ($300-$600). For a style rooted in tradition, Yuketen manages to constantly bring fresh designs to the market. Although they make many of the standard handsewn models, Yuketen really shines when their designs get a little bit out of the box.

**How to Incorporate Moccasins into a Modern Wardrobe**

In terms of formality, Mocs can be thought of as equivalent to plain leather sneakers. Meaning they’ll work fine for smart casual outfits and may even be acceptable in a particularly lenient business casual environment. Stylistically, Mocs are at home with other Americana staples, but also have a spot in Ivy canon, particularly the popular “rugged ivy” aesthetic. In generally, mocs can be substituted anywhere casual leather boots would be appropriate - think flannels, dark denim, waxed cotton, and earth tone chinos. Likewise, they’ll work as appropriate summer footwear with most basic shorts / t shirt (or other casual shirting) combos. 

Moccasins are most commonly made of more casual leathers - pull up or pebble grain cow rather than smooth calfskin for example. Deer skin (or deer skin lined) and buffalo hide are also not uncommon and work well with the moc aesthetic as do various suede/rough out makeups. Generally, lighter brown leathers work more naturally in the summer while darker makeups pair more naturally with wool socks and heavier fall fabrics, but either could easily pull double duty.

I will go through some of the main things that I have, I have accumulated these stuff over the years and ill usually shop maybe 2x a year in the big sales and buy a  lot of higher quality stuff I like the look of (usually impulse buys) 

**Jackets**

Camel Norse Projects overcoat - my main jacket but not suitable for all conditions

A black Penfield puffer jacket 

Some other black overcoats 

A black denim shearling collar jacket 

**Hoodies and jumpers**

3 hoodies from norse projects in colours of black navy and grey 

More hoodies including a yellow aime Leon deore hoodie 

A few uniqlo roll necks

A thick Navy Norse Projects wool turtle neck  jumper 

**T shirts** 

Various t shirts in black and white 

A red stussy long sleeve rugby shirt 

Various  uniqlo ocbds in white and pink etc that I wear for work 





**Trousers**

Black skinny Acne Jeans I've had for a while 

Uniqlo wide leg, wool material trousers but they aren't wool in brown and grey 

Uniqlo crop trousers in black and navy 

**Shoes**

Pink margiela Gats 

Pink Common projects 

Black High top converse  70s  + white pair 

Horse hair print converse 70s 

Black maison margiela back zip boots 

Black side zip suede cowboy boots type things 

Black Dr martens 1461 

Nike airmax 95s in pink and grey 

So now as you can see I have a lot of stuff but I don't really know how to put any of it together and I don't seem to like any of it when I wear it...

 Usually I will randomly chuck stuff together I kind of like if I go out but I never feel like it looks great. 

I'm 25 and I work in a university office at the moment so business casual I guess, I wear roll necks a lot in the winter 

I am a fan of the high fashion streetwear look which combines tailoring and streetwear e.g wool trousers, stuff I could wear for work and for going to the pub on a weekend etc 

For the last year I've been going to the gym to try to improve my body so that stuff looks better on me as I was very skinny fat at the start of the year. 

I am not a fan of Americana etc or the mfa uniform really, just that high fashion style if it could be described as that. I used to be very into minimalism but I found myself getting very bored of wearing black jeans every outfit. 

Any advice for pieces I could buy to improve this wardrobe/ how I could put things together to be nice and cohesive would be very appreciated.

I’ve never been one to care about how I present myself. I would always say “If they really want to hang out with me they wouldn’t care about appearances.” However these years I’ve learned that appearance is all too important. But this isn’t for others, this is for myself. In a bizarre post about berets I exclaimed that I wanted to better myself. This includes looks. I need some tips for fashion and beauty routines.

What do I do with my face? 
I was lucky enough to not get acne at this age. However I have a ton of blackheads or whatever these black spots are called on my nose. No matter how much I was I can’t seem to get them off. What do I do?

What clothes to wear?
I usually just wear a shirt, shorts, jacket around my waist, and slippers. I live in Hawaii and the temperature gets up to 90 degrees (even in winter). 

What are some good routines?
I need to kick my life back into shape, what should I do to build good habits? 

What do I do with my hair?
Seriously like wtf are hairstyles. I have a bowl cut (but not to obvious of one think of lego Harry Potter’s hair) 

How do I stop biting my lip and nails?
I tend to bite things when I get nervous and with server social anxiety this is a problem. Sometimes I bite my lips to the point where they bleed and same with my nails.

Yikes!
Any other advice for my mess of a life?

Update: thanks for the help guys. i got better. for a bit. then i made everything worse. i’m sorry to disappoint."|Lizardspaghetti|False|https://redd.it/eexpea|44|0.84|1|13|1|malefashionadvice

This year I reviewed 5 leather white sneakers at different price points, to see what you get for your money when purchasing this men's fashion staple. After every review many readers would ask how they compare to Common Projects and the answer is usually that they don't compare. But every shoe has its place and here I look at the visual differences between Common Projects and the rest.

Oh just quickly, here's my current leather white sneaker rankings by category (excluding CPs).

**Best bang for buck rankings:** Svensson Classic Low, Beckett Simonon Reid, Clae Bradley, Adidas Stan Smith, Oliver Cabell Low 1

**Best budget rankings**: Clae Bradley, Adidas Stan Smith, Beckett Simonon Reid, Svensson Classic Low, Oliver Cabell Low 1

*^(Note 1: When two shoes are pictured, Common Projects will be on the left unless stated.)*

*^(Note 2: I haven't had a chance to review Koio or Greats, because the combination of exchange rate and shipping to Australia means it's actually cheaper to buy Common Projects here.)*

ef0v9g|2019-12-24 12:40:10|Ideas on DIY'ing a jacket to cover up visible orange inner lining?|"I have this parka, which is still within its return period and I'm on the fence about. I really love it and even love the orange visible lining, but I'd like to wear it on more formal occasions during winter now and then and the glaring orange patch would be a bit of an unwelcome, trendy distraction.

Unfortunately, I haven't managed to see another parka as nice as this one this season anywhere in the UK. It has this muted navy colour, no visible logos and is a very simple yet nicely tailored shape. All the things I wanted. 

&#x200B;

I can easily just have a tailor stitch something over a little of the inner lining, but that would be very permanent and would hurt resale later down the line if necessary (though I do consider this an investment piece, but you never know).

&#x200B;

Is there anything I could do myself, maybe some cool product on the market I'm unaware of that could handle a job like this. Some sticky patch thing or whatever that wouldn't look naff? The other side of the jacket doesn't show the orange lining as it has a pocket sewn in. 

&#x200B;

Can't believe this was taken with a modern iPhone in 2019.. but this is what I'm talking about:

eeqdxq|2019-12-23 20:52:15|How to mix styles in a cohesive way?|"Hi, so this may be an unanswerable question, and that’s ok — I just want to hear some opinions. Basic info: I’m a nonbinary trans guy-ish (not on T, bind regularly except around family, relatively curvy and try to hide it, prefer masc androgynous presentation), my overall budget is low but ability to thrift and alter things is relatively high. I’m 22. 

Since I was young I’ve had many different interests when it comes to fashion, but was rarely confident enough to wear anything that stood out — and when I did, I felt shitty because it didn’t ‘look right’ (what I now know was dysphoria). It fluctuated and got more eclectic as my music taste expanded — 70s punk DIY, goth, mori, hippie, and more recently a very minimalist monochrome look. I mostly wore jeans and hoodies and flannel shirts. Now, I wear the same with the addition of more formal shirts and some flowy hippie-ish long sleeved shirts in the summer that are less about style and more to hide my arms. My style is actually a lot of functional stuff: baggy shirts to hide my hips, long sleeves to hide my arms (scars), etc. 

I want to branch out, but every week I’m enamoured with a different style, and it’s not that I’m indecisive per se, it’s more that I genuinely love several styles and which one I most want to wear varies depending on my mood. I don’t want to own a shit ton of clothes; I’m into minimalism and also don’t want to support fast fashion if I can avoid it. 
But I want to express all the different sides of myself, and have fun with fashion. I feel stuck: it doesn’t feel right to wear tweed and hand knitted jumpers one week, and full 2005 emo getup the next, and then suddenly switch to tie dye baggy trousers and a ton of jewellery. 

I know I could say “fuck it” and wear whatever, but I want to have a cohesive style that feels like mine, rather than like I’m playing dress up with other people’s styles. I’ve tried to find common ground between the styles I like, but all I have so far is this: dark, muted or earthy colours, androgyny, skinny jeans, “lived in” rather than overly polished. 

Any thoughts? Does anyone have experience combining disparate styles into something that feels cohesive?"|a-chilleus|False|https://redd.it/eeqdxq|18|0.74|0|24|1|malefashionadvice

- All listings **must** be posted from reputable platforms like Grailed, Ebay, Depop, Poshmark, etc. 

- All transactions are to be conducted through these sites. If you go offsite, you do so at your own risk.

- **All disputes should be handled through Grailed/Ebay/Paypal.**
__________________________________

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers. 

- Ask for measurements if there aren't any. Tag sizes vary wildly. 

If you want to do a trade: 

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection."|AutoModerator|False|https://redd.it/een920|7|0.86|0|21|1|malefashionadvice

That despite being costumery, those medieval looks can be pretty banging.

edyj7v|2019-12-22 01:31:55|In between sizing sucks. The only options are to tailor everything or lose/gain weight for most brands.|"Ever run into the issue where you're stuck between a small and medium (or medium and large) for most apparel and most if not all of your wardrobe is no longer relevant to the way your body has changed? Small fits perfectly around the torso but is too tight around the shoulders and arms, whereas medium is the opposite. Perfect around the shoulders and arms, but basically a dress around the torso.

This essentially means you would have to tailor every medium sized shirt you buy or deal with the lack of mobility that comes with wearing small. It fits fine if you're standing still or walking, but the minute you have to reach for something it's tight and uncomfortable.

How do you deal with this? In the past, I would have just bought the medium shirt because I don't like when clothes literally hug my skin, but I'm tired of spending money on clothes only to regret it several months later because the fit sucks. Online shopping isn't any easier. You always have to buy 2 of everything, even with size charts and half the time the size charts are so generalized it doesn't apply to specific articles of clothing (shirts, blazers, coats, etc). 

I spent some hours at the mall checking out fits (probably a bad idea the weekend before Christmas) and I couldn't find a single store where I actually liked how things fit.

Then throw in things like classic fit, classic stretch, slim fit, slim stretch, ultra slim and it's no wonder nothing fits right."|_Path|False|https://redd.it/edyj7v|31|0.84|0|25|1|malefashionadvice

edw4ru|2019-12-21 22:10:42|Initial Review: Threads of Apollo's Odysseus Bomber Jacket Review|"[Obligatory Album First](https://imgur.com/a/S3fj4t4)

I thought I would do a review on the [Threads of Apollo Odysseus Bomber Jacket In Olive Green](https://threadsofapollo.com/products/odysseus-bomber-jacket) as there doesn't seem to be much info out there on this company and their products. The company first came to my attention in 2018 during a [black friday sale](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalMaleFashionCDN/comments/a2imlz/special_offer_for_fellow_canadians_threads_of/) but at the time, I was too large to want to risk buying something that wouldn't fit or that I wouldn't like later on. 

I've had my eye on the company ever since, a little lame but I get very patriotic for small startups formed in Canada. And I love the story of what (Wakkas)[www.reddit.com/user/threads_of_apollo) has done and accomplished so far. Before purchasing during their 2019 [Black Friday Sale](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalMaleFashionCDN/comments/e3c99b/threads_of_apollo_fullgrain_leather_jackets/) I made sure to re-engage to learn about the company again. Their site provides a lot of background information about what goes into jacket. [1](https://threadsofapollo.com/pages/leather) [2](https://threadsofapollo.com/pages/about-us) [3](https://threadsofapollo.com/pages/faq)

I spent **$195 USD**($260 CDN) after using a coupon provided from the black friday thread. Before the coupon, the retail price is **$225 USD**($300 CDN). The price also has free shipping.

^(I actually had to edit this before submitting, and do a double take as I thought the $225 price was after sale price(not including coupon), and not what it's currently going for. I go more into detail about the quality at this price point in the review.)

#Details and Sizing:
I am 6'3"", 42inch chest, 210lbs of skinny fat and have been working on getting down to 180lbs. Yes, yes I know, I shouldn't buy products for weight that I am not at, but I carry the majority of that weight in my thighs. So I don't expect the jacket to change much on me. The jacket is made of full grain sheep skin leather which is *incredibility* soft and supple.

Feels like butter in the hands, so I don't think any compromise was made on leather. With sheep skin leather, comes the opportunity for the jacket to stretch as I wear. Which I think is important because this jacket is ***slim***. When the reviews and product mention that, you better believe it. Speaking with the owner he mentions that the model is wearing a size up than what would be ideal at his height/weight listed on the product details. 

Going by suggestion of the owner, I decided to get the jacket in an XL. I *think* the [jacket](https://i.imgur.com/uTA3mLM.jpg) hits my shoulders right, but I might be wrong? What do you guys think? I'm fine with the length, as I know some people do want higher cuts on their bombers. I'm not sure if going XL would have been the best bet to make or not. If I had lived in Vancouver, I think I would have tried the jacket in Large, XL and 2XL as the owner is gracious enough to let me people meet up with him and try it on.

At this size, I am comfortably able to [hug](https://i.imgur.com/oEksOiD.jpg) myself, wear a t-shirt, a sweatshirt/chunky sweater but *not* an oversized hoodie, like my Champion's Reverse Weave(Large) which runs large on me. That might change when the leather better stretches over time though. The benefit of the slim jacket is that it affords me to fit it under my North Face Gotham Jacket (Medium) with easy. To me, that makes this a great mid-layer winter piece as well as spring jacket. 

The jacket is lined with a wonderful cotton lining on the body as well as satin lining on the sleeves. This gives it such a premium feel every time you put it on. I don't understand why other companies don't use cotton lining. The breathability of this jacket is terrific. I don't feel overheated wearing this indoors with long sleeve vs when I tried on All Saint's leather jacket, I was running a bit hot after a bit of staring at myself in the mirror at their store. 

#Price:
I'll just come out and say, *I am blown away* at the price this jacket comes out to, even if I don't include the coupon. The quality is insanely good. To me this goes head to head with similar jackets at stores near me (Danier, All Saints) and honestly, goes a little ahead. And those are $600+ CDN jackets before sale. 

The stitching of this [All Saint's Bomber](https://i.imgur.com/3WMntD3.jpg) comes very close to the stitching of [ToA's](https://i.imgur.com/amBLX89.jpg). The All Saint's went for more top stitch detail however I think this might be more of a designer choice to give the jacket a more flat feeling to help with the overall slimness of it. Both look to be the same stitch per inch by eye, but I'm not sure.


ToA's adds a ton of [pockets](https://i.imgur.com/xnirU6R.jpg)on to the inside, which is very appreciated. It's something that goes the extra mile when it didn't need to. They are very deep and easy to reach while wearing. The details of the leather seeping far back into the interior really help with the overall quality of the jacket. The jacket just has such a *nice weight*. When you put it on, you can tell you got your money's worth. I can't emphasize enough that even though this is near Zara or even GAP(sale) pricing, it's way above it in terms of quality.

#Love:
These are just details of the jacket that I love that I'm going to list off:

* The length of sleeves is a great touch. To have them so long, but still slim after the elbow was a great design choice. I can't wait to see how they age 
* Again, the overall feel the jacket is just perfect. Not too heavy if it was something like cow hide leather but substantial enough that it feels soooo good to take off/on. 
* The cuffs are super stretchy while still staying tight. This helps with pulling them up to the elbow if you want to rock that style. I have lower quality and non leather jackets that are similar cuffs, but don't really allow any give in rolling up your sleeves. Can't obviously comment of the longevity of them but I don't have worries. 
* It's not listed in the details on the product page, but I believe the pocket lining of every pocket is a polyester microfiber, which lends well in being hand warmers
* No frills all the way. This can be good and bad. The packaging was simple, in a protected large envelope. With having a strict return policy, it being a small company(I think it's just two brothers doing the majority of the importing/selling/marketing etc), small product runs per batch, I imagine these are things that if there, would increase the retail price by a lot. I appreciate that it affords me to buy the jacket at such a low price. The owner did offer to allow me to buy XL and 2XL and return though if I had made that choice


#Gripes:

* The cuffs seem to pick up a lot of hair and fluff
* Although the zippers are YKK Zippers and are a breeze to go up/down on, the main zipper feels small to grab. I imagine it's a stylistic choice, but it can take a try or two to finally be able to connect the jacket together. I wish the zipper was big, and I might take it to a tailor to switch it out.


#Conclusion:

I have no regrets about this jacket as I usually do with purchases this large. I'm very happy to be at the ground floor for my purchase because I imagine as the company grows, the prices will go up to keep up with demand, customer service, new products, etc.


The Olive Green is a beautiful colour. Almost feels like a camo as the colour is not 100% uniform. Can't wait to see how the leather ages. I think what I like overall is that the jacket is just a bomber. It doesn't try to be anything more or less than that.

Let me know if you have any questions. I think I should take a proper fit pic, as the photos are of me wearing old jeans and shirt."|air_taxi|False|https://redd.it/edw4ru|32|0.84|0|3|1|malefashionadvice

edes8g|2019-12-20 19:29:41|A note about the back pocket, and placement of things thereof.|"When I refer to ""back pocket"" I refer to the pocket found on the seat of pants. Mostly men's pants. There have been back pockets found on the back of jackets near the butt area for hundreds of years, but those are made to be thrown behind a chair and not actually sat on. The modern back pocket has always been an elusive instrument to me. Why does it exist? How did we ever get into this mentality that jamming our wallet under out butt cheek in sitting on a slant was normal? At what point in history did we say, ""You know what? Those pockets upfront aren't cutting it, I need more on my ass so that I can put something back there that is ok to sit on."" 

I started doing some very simple research, and as it turns out, the back pocket is a relatively modern invention. Now, I'm sure it has appeared throughout history a number of times, but as far as mass production, [it was introduced by Levi in 1901.](https://www.levistrauss.com/2017/01/12/pockets-full-history/) The important thing to note about this introduction is that the back pocket sits much higher up on the waist than modern jeans. Jeans in general were worn much higher up, so when sitting down, anything in the back pocket would rest on the waist, not below the buttock and not impeding on a comfortable sitting position. 

Eureka! I have discovered the truth. The whole concept of placing items in your back pocket while you sit on them is, in fact, a modern and idiotic practice. It was born purely out of the style changes of pants sitting lower on the waist and forcing items to rest not on the waist as intended, but below the buttocks. We were never meant to sit on our wallets. It's time we take a stand, pun intended, and stop this practice once and for all."|redditsgarbageman|False|https://redd.it/edes8g|214|0.91|0|59|1|malefashionadvice

ecv02u|2019-12-19 15:51:02|Peter Manning Lambskin Jacket Ripped at Elbow|"I ordered one of the Brown Lambskin Jackets from Peter Manning back at the end of April, and was initially very satisfied with the product. It fit me great, and the leather seemed nice and supple. The lining was really comfortable and it was pleasantly warm despite being so lightweight. It wasn't long before the jacket got a couple white scuffs on the cuffs, but I didn't think too much of it.
However, now barely 8 months later and after a few gentle wears, I've gotten a horrible, gaping rip on the elbow out of nowhere. I'm not kidding, I wouldn't even have realized if not for my friend pointing it out. Looking at the rip makes me seriously wonder about the leather quality since the material is so thin and barely resembles leather (almost like a felt), and it ripped so easily without me even noticing. I'm not even sure about how to go about repairing the jacket because of the material and place of the rip.
I found out about Peter Manning due to glowing recommendations from others about the fit and quality, and have ordered several pieces from them with very happy results (I think I choked up a little the first time at how well things finally fit). However, I seriously recommend for Peter Manning to find better quality or tougher material for their leather jackets.
I contacted the company via email and put a one star review on their website, but the next morning it looked like the review had been taken down. I'm not sure if it's because it didn't technically qualify as a ""Verified Purchase,"" since I ordered the Brown Lambskin Jacket but had to post on the page for the Black Jacket after seeing the Brown one was no longer available as a listing on their site. Still, it leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth about a company that I'd otherwise had pretty good experiences with, especially since it was priced at $500.
I guess joke's on me for not going with someplace more known for their leather goods.

**[Update]**

OK, what the hell. I kinda have to keep wearing this jacket for now, since it's the warmest thing I own and the weather's finally actually cold (it's usually a lot warmer where I live, which is why I don't even wear the jacket much). And I just took it off to find this on the inside on the right armpit lining (same arm as the first rip). I'm not messing around, I feel like this thing is falling apart in front of my eyes.

Seriously though, should I include this in a follow up email to the Customer Support or something? At least for this one, since it's fabric and on the inside, I can just sew it back up myself if need be. Still, I'm starting to see a trend of shoddy workmanship and quality with this jacket."|Pandemonium8|False|https://redd.it/ecv02u|16|0.6|0|19|1|malefashionadvice

I have various t-shirts, flannels, sweaters, etc. from places like ASOS, American Eagle, H&M, etc. that are 3-4 years old and fit well. Nowadays, I find myself returning almost everything I order because it's too long - like a freakishly tall yet thin cartoon character. I wear a size x-small since I'm 135 lbs, but find that the majority of x-small clothing fits downright bizarrely. It's very snug on the body, but long like someone stretched it out like a piece of taffy...

ecvmya|2019-12-19 16:36:39|How to Flex with Few Pieces in Fashion School|"Hi guys, most of my time I find myself only need to wear top and bottom. So I resort myself to Kamakura's OCBD, with the bottom of raw denim or Outlier's futurework. If a thin layering is needed, I have TNF's fleece vest or 3sixteen's Ranch Jacket. I try to find premium products as my core, such as two pairs of Alden in rotation and another pair will come soon. Or Red Wing's Merchants and Adidas Samba for the sake of versatility.

It's basic and I like it. The thing is I am a business student in a private university that's famous for its fashion department. People flexing Rick Owens, Common Projects, and Margiela on daily basis. Sure stuff I own and wear cost something and for those trained eyes in my school, they know I have an unconventional but respectable wardrobe for college students. But still, not sure if it is mentally insecure or what, there's a feeling of inferior when it comes to fashion game and I am really eager to bump it up a bit more.

Since I can only wear a few clothes due to climate, I am thinking about getting some wool, wool/linen blend trousers as a step up. Maybe getting more fleece like Patagonia's better sweater. Asides from those, I am just utterly lost right now. What should I do?

Edit: Well I guess I am being insecure. At school now and saw a dude wear the same jacket and Levi's with the same brand of bags. Will just fill the gap in my wardrobe instead of inner void."|letitflame|False|https://redd.it/ecvmya|0|0.26|0|22|1|malefashionadvice

ebxknh|2019-12-17 15:55:45|New rule on infographics and new post flair|"Hi all

**New infographic rule**

Given a few recent infographics which can be variously categorised as bad, misleading, wrong, poor quality, etc, we the moderators will be modifying our previous rules on infographics.

The new rules is:

> 3.10. Infographics will be allowed on a case-by-case basis. No previous allowed infographics will be used as precedent in our decision. Incorrect and/or very misleading infographics may be removed depending on moderator discretion.

The last sentence was the new addition for reference. 

We've added a report reason under ""Post Requirements"" for users to report infographics which they think are low quality. We've also added the rule on redesign desktop and the official Reddit app too.

We have come to this decision because even though people *do* discuss and give feedback in post comments the minority of Reddit users don't read comments, just view posts or images. In addition according to the [""fluff principle""](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html) on user generated voting sites, people are just going click or view pretty pictures, rather than long form text corrections or guides. This being the case the moderator team would rather nip bad advice in the bud.

**New infographic post flair**

A new post flair for infographic content has been added. It works across classic/old reddit and redesign/new reddit. Most old infographic content has been manually reflaired. New content should be flaired by users.

Cheers

Nay on the behalf of the /r/malefashionadvice moderator team.

- All listings **must** be posted from reputable platforms like Grailed, Ebay, Depop, Poshmark, etc. 

- All transactions are to be conducted through these sites. If you go offsite, you do so at your own risk.

- **All disputes should be handled through Grailed/Ebay/Paypal.**
__________________________________

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers. 

- Ask for measurements if there aren't any. Tag sizes vary wildly. 

If you want to do a trade: 

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection."|AutoModerator|False|https://redd.it/ebhtu0|11|0.88|0|30|1|malefashionadvice
