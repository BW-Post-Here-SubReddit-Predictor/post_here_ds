Most parents will select to disclude the “reading and reference”. While I get that many of you know that you can use Reddit this way, what if I told you that you could do more?

The way Reddit opens links, puts it into an emulator in the app almost, so you’re not actually leaving the app, meaning that if you posted “YouTube.com” in a personal subreddit or anywhere for that matter, you can use YouTube infinitely as it would fall under reading and reference.

Using this, you can use many other sites and completely abuse Reddit to get to YouTube and twitch.

Basically, when you’re done with 4 hours of memes you can move on to other sites.

ejwvrr|2020-01-04 13:54:16|Schedule recurring meetings based on four date periods per year|"Over many years I’ve found that setting recurring meetings in Outlook or Google Calendar works best when I focus on four key approximate date periods:

**P1**: first Monday after New Years in January through the Friday before the US time change

**P2**: first Monday after the EU time change through mid-July (I use Bastille Day as I work in a French company)

**P3**: around third Monday in mid-August (again, I use Assumption Day) until the EU time change end of October

**P4**: first Monday in November after the US time change until the last Friday before Christmas

*(You can eliminate the US/EU distinction if you don’t need to account for them, and the EU time change is scheduled to end in 2021.)*

This benefits you and your participants in that:  


* You are forcing yourself to review at least every 3-4 months whether or not this meeting still makes sense
* You only manage the brief periods of instability during holidays (when many schedules will vary)
* If affected, during the three weeks of hell in Spring and the hell week of Halloween imposed by US Congress when the time difference is always forgotten, you are proactively addressing it by forcing the to reschedule.  This helps to eliminate the ""I thought this meeting was always at 10:30 AM?"" reaction from your American counterpart in early March."|insanityyellowlab|False|https://redd.it/ejwvrr|0|0.44|0|0|1|lifehacks

There's a hack for that.|"A recent post somewhere else admonishing parents who send their kids to school sick got me thinking. I agree. Please don't send your kids to school like that. But what do you do if you have that one kid who seems to always catch everything and they've met their limit for absences? What do you do when you either don't have money, insurance, or (whatever reason) you can't take your child to the doctor? Here's what I did when one of my kids had a year where they caught everything and missed 10 days and we got the ""You're going to be reported to CPS if they miss one more day letter."" 

* I went down to the school's office and let them know that I received the letter.
* Reminded them that little Johnny/Susie has been having a bad year health-wise.
*  That for the rest of the school year, any time my child has a fever or is vomiting, I will bring said child to the school nurse **after classes start** for the school to decide, since the school system (don't blame the office, they're just following the law) doesn't feel that parents are competent enough to know whether or not their child is well enough for school.

Doing the above forces the school to be the one to send them home and you cannot be held responsible for their absence. Make sure that if/when you do this that your child has all their backpack and etc. with them just in case.

&#x200B;

\*\*note: I live in the US, so I don't know how well this would work anywhere else. Also, I do take my kids to the doctor only if their fever has went beyond 3 days and no signs of improvement on day 3 -OR- if it's clear they will need an antibiotic. It's a waste of my time as well as the doctor's to take my kid to the doctor for every nasty cold they caught at school or from another family member."|MintChip77|False|https://redd.it/eizz3e|31|0.73|0|23|1|lifehacks

ei1ejj|2019-12-31 10:50:42|Life Hacks I used to overcome New Year Melancholy - The steps and techniques I employed..|"**THE LIFE HACKS I USED TO OVERCOME NEW YEAR MELANCHOLY - THE STEPS AND TECHNIQUES I EMPLOYED**

In a bid to understand my conflicting thoughts and emotions that would typically emerge near the end of each year, I started reading into psychology and came to the realisation that the brain is like a computer.

According to Dr. Joe Dispenza a healthy brain can process 400 billion bits of information per second.

The brain is very sensitive in the sense that whatever we subject it to it receives, processes and then broadcasts it as our thoughts and our reality.

After coming to this realisation, I became increasingly aware that EVERYTHING I subjected my computer (or brain) to would shape my identity, personality, emotions, perspective, behaviour and reality.

**THIS LEAD ME TO RE-EVALUATE MY LIFE..**

This included the people I spent time with, the places I went and my daily habits.

I retreated and I spent time alone in meditation to reflect.

It was through this retreat that I became what I can only describe as an outward observer looking into society.

It was only then that I observed the sheer scale of the constant bombardment of false depictions of life everywhere; through film, Facebook, Instagram, porn and TV for example.

These exaggerated versions of ‘reality’ can also be found in marketing for food, holidays, fashion and dating apps.

I came to the realisation that pretty much all the imagery I subjected myself to was an exaggerated version of the true nature of life.

That through subjecting myself to these things that I had unconsciously measured my life by these inaccurate portrayals of life.

My life didn’t reflect the ‘reality’ I had subjected myself to. In turn, this made me think that I was inferior or incapable and therefore, it wasn’t worth trying.

At the end of each year I would reflect and feel sh\*t because I had not achieved the goals I wanted or just couldn’t find the consistency or motivation. Things never changed.

**I REALISED THAT I NEEDED TO FEED MY BRAIN DIFFERENT INFORMATION OR AN ‘ALTERNATIVE REALITY’..**

What kind of information would I feed my computer (or brain) in order to lead a more fulfilling life?

What kind of actions would I need to take in order to achieve this?

Part of this was based on advice I took from this contemporary Hindu philosopher by the name of Dandapani (He works with athletes and entrepreneurs in the US).

I heard him in a Youtube video saying to simplify your life. So I simplified my life.

I wrote the shortlist of the three things that were most important to me (based on his advice) and invested all my time and energy into these things.

I looked at my shortlist and then set actions that corresponded to my three life priorities.

I started finding myself saying ‘No’ to about 85-90% of everything people were asking me to do because I realised my brain will download pretty much everything I subject it to.

**I NEEDED TO PROTECT MYSELF..**

One thing on my shortlist was a commitment to self education everyday.

Through reading, I came across Stoicism and became fascinated.

How was this practice possible?

What were these people doing in order to achieve this mindset?

I started to experiment...

What kind of steps could I take to try and replicate some of the things they were doing?

**THROUGH THIS EXPERIMENT, EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE BECAME SIMPLE..**

This included the festive holidays and New Year will be the same.

I treated it like any other day.

As soon as I simplified things in my life to the key things that mattered and paid attention to the information that I fed my brain everything changed.

A lot of my unhappiness at the end of the year came from the information I was unconsciously feeding my brain throughout the year.

Once I understood how my brain works, it helped me to understand what I needed to do.

It helped me to identify the lifestyle I wanted to live where the byproduct was happiness.

The questions I asked myself above really helped.

There are some other steps I also took to reflect on other things in my life which I break down in this [step by step video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FbvhQBlCq0). You will also find a [document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cVyQN--C7P50ha3Hel1905LrZBDhvERnrFolXSDT2KY/edit) which complements the video which you can print off and work through if you wish."|LifeHackTraining|False|https://redd.it/ei1ejj|22|0.76|0|6|1|lifehacks

ehksfa|2019-12-30 11:07:31|How to get rid of morning sickness/nausea|"I've had this for like 14 months already. Visited a doctor about a year ago, told him how I feel every morning and how it is affecting a lot of things, he just told me i'm ""fine"" and nothing is ""wrong"" or something like that, I don't really remember. Then I had a blood test a week after that, I don't even know what they tested for but my parents maybe know. Results came in and basically everything was fine.

I'm a 16 years old male. Every morning is so hard. I wake up, feel like I need to puke really bad right away and my stomach is always burning a lot in the morning. I can't eat literally anything for 1-2 hours after I wake up, it will make me feel even worse. Usually about 2 hours after I wake up I might feel ""ok"". If i'm lucky it goes away in 1.5 hours. And on my ""best days"" it has lasted only 1 hour.

I haven't puked yet because of this though. Expect once like 8 months ago maybe, I had a stomach flu or something, idk what to call it in english and I was vomiting a lot that day, but it lasted for like 3 hours and then after that I was fine and my stomach didn't hurt at all anymore.

So I don't really know what to do about this situation. Every morning I feel really weak, can't eat anything for like 2 hours, feel like I need to puke so bad (but I haven't puked yet luckily), and my stomach is burning a lot. This happens every morning, sometimes it's a little bit better, and sometimes a little bit worse.

Then once asked my schools nurse too, that what could this be, and she just told me maybe my blood sugar levers are low and I should drink some fruit juice in the morning and see if that can fix it. Didn't help at all, as I expected. It's really hard to wake up and get ready for school, when I feel so sick, weak, trash and tired every morning. I have even needed to skip a few school days during the last 12 months, only because of this. And then I've had to leave school a few times too during the last 12 months, again only because of this.

Thanks in advance for helping.

&#x200B;

Edit: also to mention, when I eat after i feel a little bit better, it makes me feel a lot better. So eating definitely helps, but it's hard to do when I feel so sick so I have to wait that 1.5-2 hours before I eat."|Alexander2341|False|https://redd.it/ehksfa|6|0.77|0|52|1|lifehacks

eh83ez|2019-12-29 16:48:07|If you get stranded in a developing country with ni money or your VISA card is blocked for potential fraud even though it was you.|"This is what happened to me, I finished clubbing and was sort of drunk, my hotel was 3 miles away.  I tried requesting an Uber as I normally do in this country and the Uber app tells me card was declined.  I know I have plenty of money so figured that it was probably fraud prevention department algorithm that blocked me when they noticed too many transactions from foreign country.  I was unable to call them because I didn't have enough minutes to do so since there was only prepaid in this country.  So I used a VOIP app that came with free trial to call one of my banks and the guy asked me questions to verify if it's me, and said there is 1 other question and I have only 1 chance at it, I did answer correctly but he lied when he said I'm all set to go because I still couldn't use the Uber app due to decline again.  

So it finally occurred to me that I'm a tourist who paid $50 entry fee to enter the country and figured I might call for nearest cop to drive me hotel or maybe walk with me to hotel if he doesn't have a car.  It was 3am and no one nor any Taxi cared to drop me off even though I wanted to tell them my hotel and guest info and repay them once I fix issue.  The police woman I spoke to was nice and local calls are cheap so I still had plenty of local talk time.  She was kind enough to dispatch an Uber for me and asked me to repay at my earliest convenience.  

So the next day I tried calling my other bank since both banks blocked my Visa cards for same suspicious activity, but the automated line for getting whitelisted gave me security questions and I answered, but it also asked me ""What is my phone number on file"", i typed in my US number, but the system rejected it because the VoIP line I'm calling from doesn't match my number on file.  So I found out about Google hangouts dialer which allowed me to dial US numbers and Canada free from my GV number which is my number on file with bank and I was able to get the card whitelisted for one of my banks, but that other bank with that guy who lied is still blocked and am considering completely leaving them, this is exactly why I brought multiple cards and usual leave 1 at hotel room lockbox in case my wallet gets lost or mugged.  

I ended up repaying the police woman 85% more money as she saved my life.

Regular daily dog food: I prepare a large batch of 3:1 cooked brown rice & cooked ground turkey, + bag of frozen veggies. Mix together & Freeze in small containers & rotate these into fridge to thaw & serve as needed. I add a powdered vitamin mineral supplement to each serving, but in a pinch, eggshells serve the same purpose.  

Jerky: buy gizzards, hearts, liver etc and/or any meat on clearance, make jerky treats by baking at 200F for 5-8 hrs

Biscuits: make batter using water or low sodium broth, leftover meat or meat scraps with low or no seasoning, eggs & eggshells, leftover rice, garbanzo flour (or canned beans) or coconut flour. You can add pumpkin, potato, cranberry, banana, peanut butter*, peas, carrots, apple, beans depending on what you have on hand. Canola oil is safe for dogs do I line my pan with that. Bake at 325 for 25-30 min. 
*too much PB is a hazard or dogs; powdered PB is often preferable but check ingredients 

Each fall, after Halloween & Thanksgiving, I ask neighbors for whole pumpkins they used for decoration, and/or scraps and bones from holiday meals, I make soup stock and treats from them.  
I buy canned unflavored pumpkin on sale after thanksgiving, brown rice & potatoes in bulk, and broth, eggs & plain yogurt on sale.

edcb50|2019-12-20 16:22:26|LPT: If you're alone during the holiday season and find it difficult, here are some holiday tips to making things a bit easier.|"  

·**Be realistic.** It is hard for anyone to not be affected by the holiday hype. Television, movies, magazines, and social media are full of images of people having fun. It is easy to feel left out and let down. Realize that no-one’s life is perfect, most families face challenges and that people usually only share the best moments of their lives on social media. Shift your focus to the great things you *do* have in your life – a true friend, a loving family member or supportive co-workers. 

· **Take a break from social media.** Studies have shown that heavy social media over time results in lower psychological well-being and feelings of loneliness, rather than vice versa. Unplug for a while.

· **Be proactive.** Loneliness causes us to underestimate how much our friends and family care. Instead of waiting for people to invite you somewhere, be the one to suggest activities or be the host. Take the plunge, reach out to friends, family and acquaintances, and ask them what they are doing for the holidays. When asked about your plans say you have nothing scheduled yet – you will likely receive a few invitations! 

· **Join in**. There is always lots to do during the holiday season that is not centered on faith or beliefs. Find ways to join in: an office potluck, baking treats for the neighbours, or community events.

· **Volunteer.** Many people are alone or need help during the holidays. Lend a hand at a shelter, nursing home or food bank. Volunteering not only benefits others, but it is also a great way to connect with your community and meet like-minded people.

· **Become involved in your faith community**. Churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques hold many social events throughout the year that are great opportunities to forge new relationships.

· **Expand your social circle**. Making friends takes time and effort. Sign up for an exercise class or team sport. If you are musical, join a band or choir. Investigate local meetups – groups of individuals with shared interests who plan events. 

**Take a trip**. Many singles groups arrange trips during the holidays. If you can, get away for a few days."|Human02211979|False|https://redd.it/edcb50|1964|0.95|0|78|1|lifehacks

For cleaning especially grimy hands/arms, like after working on the car, these plastic scrubber things along with the usual brush can’t be beat.

They usually begin to immediately unroll into a long floppy tube… but thats ok. Makes it easier to wrap around fingers, twist & whatnot… some like cutting the tube in half.

The cheap ones work best, but some are made of especially soft plastic, and don’t work as well as the harder ones. In my experience the pricy high end ones usually don’t do well for this purpose. When done, save it for future clean ups. For hand & arm use they last and work well for a very long time.

Another trick is to lather up your hands & arms with bar soap before starting the job, being sure to work it well up under fingernails. Keep working it in till dry. Later clean up will be immensely easier… however, this doesn’t work well for jobs involving water.

And yes, I know about gloves… but they just aren suitable for all jobs.

Yeah, I tried all the tricks like drinking water, drinking water at a specific angle, holding your breath, etc.
But as we all know hiccups are caused by uncontrollable spasms of the Diaphragm muscle.
So let's think real hard here - how do you relax a muscle? Certainly not by contracting/using it. So holding your breath is out. Drinking water - could work, because the Diaphragm has a little hole where the digestion system has the pass through, so there could be a connection?
Either way, what works almost every time is breathing air in and out - but REALLY slowly. Inhale as deep as you can and very very slowly.
And you should be good.

What I've found to work really well is to put your chapstick on at night instead! It's great because when I wake up I find that my lips are nice and smooth and look so much better.

You can try this with any chapstick (I find EOS is pretty good) and just put it on before going to bed.

eae5g9|2019-12-14 02:49:02|After years I finally figured out how to reheat a fast food burger to make it taste better then homemade and better then when it was fresh at the restaurant!|"Seperate the bun, hamburger patty, cheese and any veggies or toppings. If cheese is all melted to the patty which it probably is just scrape it off and eat it or give it to your dogs, or you can apply the scraped off cheese at the end as well if you wish! It still tastes great, creamy melty gooey and wonderful even if its a little ugly!

Scrape the condiments off the bun and put them in a bowl to reapply afterwards. Microwave the bun for like 15 seconds to warm it up. Melt some butter and brush it on the buns then put them in the frying pan and toast 'em in the frying pan to a beautiful golden brown after microwaving.

Season the hamburger patty, add some salt, pepper, seasoning salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and anything else you'd like! Be your own boss and season it to your hearts content however you wish! <3 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and heat the burger patty for 8-10 minutes. Afterwards put it in a searing hot frying pan with melted butter to give it a good sear on both sides. (If you got a single hamburger from the fast food restaurant and are really hungry and want a double then get a quarter pound of non-frozen 85% lean/15% fat ground beef, add some salt, pepper and whatever else you'd like. Carefully shape it into a patty without over kneading it and fry it in the frying pan as well until it's done!)\*\*\*

Reapply the cheese to the patty(s) (if you were actually able to remove it/scrape it off and still have it and didn't feed it to the dogs or eat it yourself, which is totally understandable if you ate it yourself or gave it to your dogs) and add a new slice of cheese as well to jazz it up (Highly recommended!) Reassemble the burger with everything but the condiments and toppings and Microwave for like 10-20 seconds to so cheese gets warm and melty and buns stick to the patty via the melty cheese! <3

Re-Add your toppings (lettuce, tomato, onions, etc.) and condiments from earlier! Add some fresh veggies and condiments too if you wish!

VIOLA! You now got a burger thats better then when it was fresh, better then homemade and better then any fancy 5 star restaurant, GUARANTEED!

&#x200B;

\*\*\*Highly recommended that you add your own homemade patty to the fast food burger, it seriously enhances it like 1000% and makes it >\~>\~>THAT<\~<\~< much BETTER!!! <3 XOXOXOXO"|MinnesotaBoy25|False|https://redd.it/eae5g9|0|0.32|0|10|1|lifehacks

Hold onto some metal object such as a key, then with the other end of said object touch a ‘grounded’ object.

Switch cover plate screws (as in photo), most appliances & metal plumbing fixtures are examples of a few electrically grounded items.\[1\] For the car, after opening the door, with the key touch some unpainted metal part of the lock mechanism.

For the record, I can still feel some larger sparks when doing this, but their severity/unpleasantness is very much mitigated.

As always, YMMV.

e4o2dw|2019-12-01 21:27:55|A bucket of gravel works as a Christmas tree stand. (Instructions in the post)|"This tip comes thanks to u/cypherpunks. 
Last night our Christmas tree stand decided to give up the ghost on our fully decorated tree :( This morning before heading out to the store I decided to check ol' reddit for recommendations on a new stand. The consensus was a $90 German made stand that, while impressive, was still $90. Then I come across this [old post](https://reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/14mq01/the_best_christmas_tree_stand_a_bucket_full_of/). I figured what hell let's give it a try, and to my delight it works, and pretty well too. 

[My Album ](https://imgur.com/gallery/2JgOg0V)

Instructions from u/cypherpunks:

Just get a watertight bucket of a couple of gallons capacity (you do not need a 5 gallon bucket), and enough gravel to fill it. (Often you can ""borrow"" it from somewhere for a few weeks, like a disused railroad track.)

1.	Prepare the tree: cut off very low branches, freshen the stump so it'll absorb water.
2.	Place a single layer of stones on the bottom of the bucket. This is to allow water to get at the tree base.
3.	Place the tree in the middle.

4.	Fill with gravel.
5.	Check that tree is straight. Push to straight vertical position.
6.	While someone is holding the tree straight, shake the bucket to settle the gravel. This gets a good ""grip"" on the base.
7.	Fill with water.
8.	If the bucket is ugly, cover it with paper, foil, or whatever.

It's more solid than any ""tree stand"" contraption I've ever used, and holds a whole lot of water, so the tree doesn't dry out. And it's actually a lot easier to make look nice, because despite being bigger, it's not as ""lumpy"".

Edit To remove when done, pull the tree straight up. Then you can take the bucket outside, pour out the water, and return the gravel to wherever it came from."|WightHouse|False|https://redd.it/e4o2dw|22|0.88|0|4|1|lifehacks

Tap your brush and handle on the seat to shake off what water you can and do the finishing move to get the wand to its holder between drips.

take pool noodles and cut them in half, measure where your dog's height is of their body and nose generally and tape the half cut pool noodles to the wall. I used painters tape so it doesn't hurt the wall. Put the noodles in common areas they hit. 

Basically it turns your dog into a bowling ball with the bumpers on, but it's better than all the head and body shots to the unexpected wall. Especially when they learn your house layout and get cocky then their speed goes up and the hits are even harder.
