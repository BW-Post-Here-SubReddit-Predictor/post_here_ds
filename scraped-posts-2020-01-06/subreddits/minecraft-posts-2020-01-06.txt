#**Gold**

[NephilimYT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO6kEHEPgKk&feature=youtu.be)

Really liked this build and how atmospheric it was. The choice to show it off at night was a very good one. It allowed all of those light sources you added to come into play, by lighting up the build. I also really like what you did in the cave, really cool design and build. My only very very small gripe is that it felt a little too hollow and personally I didn't like that. So I feel the shape inside could have been maybe a little more chaotic or natural, but that's really only my tastes. 

Great build!

#**Silver**

[yoctosecond](https://imgur.com/a/u9gwL0i)

Really liked the atmosphere around this build too. The darkness with the lights really made more special than it would have been if it was just houses on a cliff. I also really liked your block choice. The terracotta really worked well with the colours of the ice, at least in my eyes. My only complaint was the actual pit, or cavern, where there wasn't really anything else. I do realize it was a realistic shape, I think my problem came from being able to see that far. Maybe some glass and some black concrete towards the bottom, to make it seem more like a pit would have made it work better and seem a little more real.

Great build!

**Bronze**

[RandomMuze](https://imgur.com/gallery/T7X7FkV)

Maybe it's because the other two relied a lot on darkness and lighting but I liked this build for how cheerful it was. I liked how much it was built out of wood and also the campfire scene. I also liked how much it actually felt like a cave with the shape of it. I didn't really like the path leading to it because I felt it needed to be a little wider with the amount of detail that went into it. The railings on it seemed to pop out more than the path itself. 

Good build!


**Honourable mentions**

#**Introduction**

For some reason I've been really into steampunk stuff lately and I guess I need some inspiration because that's what kept coming back to me for a theme this week! So, let's get building a large mansion in a steampunk style!

**New Textures**

Since we have an official release of the new textures, they are now allowed (along with the old ones). However, if you use the new textures, please specify. I wouldn't want to think you're using a texture pack and disqualify you. I'm not as used to the textures, so I may not recognize them right away. 

**Inspiration**

#**Challenge**

**Steampunk mansion**

Build a steampunk mansion. Since you usually build up in steampunk, the mansion must have at least three floors in it. Those are the only requirements.

____________

#**Rules**

1. **Submitting an entry** To submit an entry, you must comment on this post and format your comment like this:

Any minecraft version is allowed and you may build with custom terrain, creative mode, world edit or etc as long as it doesn't add any new blocks to the game. **Shader pictures can be added in a SEPERATE album as bonus pictures.** None of those pictures will be accounted for when we judge the entries. Only vanilla screenshots.

3\. **Any version of minecraft** i.e. PS3, Xbox 360, Pocket Edition.

4\. **No preexisting builds** We're going with the honour system here but if anything had already been built before the start of the contest, don't submit it.

5\. **Build teams are allowed** There may be more that one person building for a challenge but only one person may submit their entry with their account 

6\. **New textures are allowed** The new versions of Jappa's textures are allowed to be used along with old legacy textures.

ekzhg4|2020-01-06 20:08:21|There should be a way to turn enchanted leather armor into enchanted books.|"Perhaps the process could involve the smithing table?

I've been finding so much enchanted leather armor recently, especially in ocean chests. And while they're nice at first they don't serve a purpose after getting enchanted iron/diamond.

So since we have this surplus of enchanted leather, why not create a way to turn the armor into books?

**My proposal**:

\-You input 2 enchanted leather armor and some paper into the table.

\-The output is 1 enchanted book, that randomly has a lower tier of ONE of the enchantments

**Example:**

\-I input 1 leather tunic with thorns II and 1 helmet with unbreaking III (and paper)

\-I get a book with either thorns I OR unbreaking I or II

&#x200B;

eky892|2020-01-06 18:41:31|Heads up: Memory/RAM usage spiking when joining a server while using a resource pack? Solution here:|"Hi all. I've been trying to fix the issue of bizarre memory usage (16GB+) on client side when joining a server that was very hard to explain. On single player, everything worked fine and used at most 4 to 5G ram, but on the (very small-scale) server it spiked to 16GB and higher making it basically unplayable. (In this case, the texture pack was Default 3D Medium)

After a solid few hours I found the reason, I was running OrebFuscator plugin to battle X-Raying, but this also means radically increasing the amount of ""ores"" around the player. Running something like a 3D resource pack results in making all ores 3D textured, and thus using a lot of memory.

So I have been thinking after reading some comments and posts on the subreddit. Imagine how awesome it would be to run a huge server with many people in that create a world.

When the dragon died, it didn't drop any experience orbs.. My son was surprised, he asked me : did you pick up the exp ? I didn't , I promise, even if he didn't really believe me :D

Right after this we decide to visit ender cities, and he was unlucky enough to drop a perl right on the edge of a platform between the islands.. and he died with all his good stuff, falling to the void. Before he crafted a rope to hang hilmself to end a so unfortunate life in Minecraft, I told him to not worry, I will fish, fish and fish again to get all his stuff back.

So, after this sad story, it is what happened : I decided to **double fishing**, by connecting another controler in my game(a little bit tricky and confusing but it worth it), **playing LAN** this time. **I connected an account I never played before minecraft with**. And.... TaaDDaaaaaa !!

This new account started the game with **68 level xp**, I guess the xp I was supposed to get by defeating the ender dragon.

ekoqvq|2020-01-06 04:23:41|How to Restore a Corrupted Minecraft Save.|"**ALL CREDIT GOES TO YOUTUBER KAYSPLAYS**
[Video Here](https://youtu.be/yUl1_SzIN8A)

So there you are, playing the survival world you have been playing for an entire month now. You have acquired god like weapons and tools and you have a fancy mob grinder that became so overstuffed it caused your game to lag and crash. No big deal until you reload the game only to find that your world no longer appears on the list of playable worlds. So, what do you do? You search how to get your world back of course, only to find that most guides are just wrong. Well, all except for one. In this guide I will show you how to recover your lost world in both versions of Minecraft.

**Minecraft Java**

If you decided to continue reading instead of jumping to the video I will tell you step by step how to recover your world for the java edition of minecraft.

**Step 1:** Find the problem. 

If your problem is similar to the one given in the example above fixing the save may result in another crashed save. That is why I recommend finding a solution to the issue first.

**Step 2:** Create a new world.

This generates new, uncorrupt files that we will need. If you can, use the same seed.

**Step 3:** Open up your saves directory.

Found here - C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\\.minecraft\saves

**Step 4:** Find your new world and open the files. Copy the Level.dat - Level.dat_old - session.lock - and spc.settings files.

**Step 5:** Find your corrupt world files. Delete and replace the same four folders.

**Step 6:** Run minecraft. If you have completed these steps successfully your world should show up. **NOTE THAT YOU WILL SPAWN IN A RANDOM SPOT PREPARE TO NEED TO BREAK BLOCKS AS YOU MAY SPAWN INSIDE ONE**.

If all goes well you have your world, and your items, back.

**Minecraft Bedrock**

The steps to recover a save on the bedrock edition are surprisingly similar to those shown in the video. They are different, however. Using the video I figured out how to recover a world in the bedrock edition after my own world became corrupted. Here are the steps:

**Step 1:** Same as java edition. Identify the problem.

 If your problem is the same as the one in my example you may need to set your difficulty to peaceful before loading the fixed save, as it may crash again.

**Step 2:** Create a new world.

Again the same as java edition. This creates new, uncorrupted files that we need to repair the old world. You are going to want to try to use the same seed if you can.

**Step 3:** Open your worlds directory.

This directory is a tough one to find. And a long one at that. Too long for me to type on mobile, so [Here](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/330412) is a link to an answer on stack exchange on how to reach the directory.

**Step 4:** Find your new world folder.

After opening your minecraftworlds folder you should see files with names like ""1g4AAHBsAQA="". These are your worlds. You can tell what world is what by opening the file and opening levelname.txt.

**Step 5:** Copy the new Level.dat and Level.dat_old files. Note that level.dat may display as only level in the world folder 

**Step 6:** Go to the corrupt world and replace the two corrupt level.dat files with the two new ones.

This will fix your save and make it playable once again. You won't spawn in some random spot like in java edition and you will keep all of your items.

Since i don't have much patience i am not a good builder, and exploring is very boring for me.

I originally got this error out of nowhere while trying to play modded minecraft (same mod had worked fine before). After trying several solutions on this website:  [https://appuals.com/fix-could-not-create-the-java-virtual-machine/](https://appuals.com/fix-could-not-create-the-java-virtual-machine/)  and doing some research, I uninstalled java and tried to reinstall using the 64 bit version (based on the solution from this reddit post  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/25kd5u/could\_not\_create\_the\_java\_virtual\_machine\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/25kd5u/could_not_create_the_java_virtual_machine_help/) ).  

&#x200B;

Now, when I try to install Java, I get the same error message.  I've tried the solutions on Java's website and none of them have worked.  Any other advice would be appreciated, thanks.
