d3okss|2019-09-13 12:32:57|[meta] It's not required, but if you make a new account _just_ to post to Relationship Advice, please start the account with `ThrowRA` in the name of your account. [yes this relaxes the rule a bit. An update on the Updates Rule is in here as well]|"**TL;DR on Throwaways:** If you wish to request relationship advice, please start your new username with `ThrowRA` -- it relaxes the content checks a bit on your post.

**TL;DR on Updates:** If you post updates: try to limit it to just one _unless_ you're asking for follow-up advice, and don't ever feel obligated to update everyone here.

---

**For regulars:** We took a LOT of good feedback on the two new rules (the Updates rule and the Throwaways rule). We're hoping this is a pretty good compromise between the concerns everyone raised versus the need to defuse some of the more prolific trolling:

 1. **Throwaways:** We relaxed the rule such that we're _not automatically removing every post from a new account._ In other words, every account can post to /r/relationship_advice.
* One bit of feedback we got is that a ton of people who post here are posting from new accounts because they've been led here from other platforms, e.g. facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc., for help. Knowing this, we changed how we're handling the rule. 
* That said, while we're applying content checks to posts more rigorously when they don't begin with `ThrowRA`, it's never an automatic removal.
* _yes, we stopped checking for the hyphen (It used to be `ThrowRA-`; now it's just `ThrowRA` and not case-sensitive). Apparently it's almost impossible to copy the text on mobile and include the hyphen, and tons of people were just forgetting it, so we dropped the hyphen._

 2. **Updates:** Updates asking for specific follow-up advice are totally fine. Updates that don't actually ask for advice are limited to only one.
* We recognize the gaping loophole this appears to leave, but honestly, it keeps the comments on-track with advice-focused conversation rather than derailed threads on unrelated topics like politics. 
* Apparently a lot of you _really_ like updates. So we're trying to strike a balance between updates and new posts.
* Any update that asks for specific follow-up advice (""Hey Reddit; I did this thing from my last thread, and this happened. How do I fix this?"") are totally fine.
* But back to back updates (""Hey Reddit! I did this thing today!"" day 2: ""Hey Reddit! Life's pretty good now!"" day 3: ""Hey Reddit! Thanks for all your help, we'll be together after all!"") -- Those can be condensed all into one post; the play-by-play isn't needed.
* In all honesty, I personally communicated this rule _very_ poorly. I'm genuinely sorry about that.

We'll revisit this during the next seven days to see how it's going with an open discussion thread at that point.

eku797|2020-01-06 13:33:41|Should I (30m) tell my online friends (30's) that I'm going to die?|"I'd rather not go into too much detail because I know my friends occasionally browse reddit.

Two years ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illness. I've already told my family and real life friends, but my online friends haven't got a clue. We're a close-knit and small group from all over the world, and quite diverse with a wide range of race, gender and sexuality. We've known each other for about 10 or so years, and usually we'd watch shows, play games and just hang out.

Recently my condition has been getting worse, and my gut feeling is that I probably don't have much time.

This has been on my mind constantly as of late, should I tell them the truth or should I lie to them?

I've already come up with an elaborate story on why I'll be gone, and as far as they know, I'll be living happily ever after.

&#x200B;

Edit:

Thank you for the overwhelming amount of comments. I've decide to tell them. I guess in a way I was sparing myself from their grief as I saw what it did to my family and friends. And I didn't think less of them because they're online, I just thought it'd be easier for them to not know I'm going to die, and rather I've moved on somewhere else."|CowardBeechWood|False|https://redd.it/eku797|6275|0.97|1|359|1|relationship_advice

How can I repay him?|"To start off I became extremely fatigued (and a bundle of other nasty symptoms) at the start of last year and have been declining ever since. I have been diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome) and fibromyalgia. At this point in time I have had to stop working. I have become so ill it is a struggle to cook and on a particularly bad day to even brush my teeth or hold my phone. 

Since getting sick my boyfriend of two years has gone above and beyond. He has helped pay for medications, driven me places if I'm too sick to drive and taken on a huge amount of the housework. We have also had to move in with my dad since I could no longer afford to keep up with the rent payments and housework in our own place. BF has been so accepting and helpful throughout this whole thing.

However I feel so extremely guilty that I'm putting him through this. He knows how I feel as I have broken down a few times in front of him. I was just wondering if any of you guys have any ideas of how I can repay him/show him how thankful I am. I have very limited energy and money so  really struggling to come up with ideas.

ektsy6|2020-01-06 12:55:54|Work colleague turned friend told me intimate details about her body and I don't know how to react|"So, I've been friends with a wonderful women for a few years now. We get on so well, sharing the same tastes in many things like music, hobbies, opinions, humour etc. We hang out at lunch together sometimes and socialise together occasionally. I would go and say we're best friend's. We spend a lot of time together at work just talking about stuff despite sitting opposite sides of the office. She always comes over to chit chat. 

On a works do, we ended up alone together and she told me some very explicit details about her body. She informed me how 'tight' she is, it's appearance, told me about her sex life or lack of and various positions she can or cannot do. She wasn't drunk, had a few beers but was sober enough to know what she was saying. I was really shocked by this as it's not something we've spoken about before and we've been fine since. No awkwardness at all. 
Under normal circumstances I'd be thinking she might see me more than a friend. However, I'm married and she's engaged so these comments have confused me somewhat. 
I know our circumstances might not change the fact for some people but she's in to a particular type of guy which I don't meet the criteria so I'm very confident that she doesn't see me like that. She's often telling me about her type of guy so it's no secret.
Why do you think she told me this stuff or am I just reading too much in to this and it was just two friends having a chat?
I'm a bit bamboozled by it and would like some advice on what to do (if anything) or what it might mean."|termos-tea|True|https://redd.it/ektsy6|720|0.95|0|271|1|relationship_advice
ekx9lh|2020-01-06 17:32:26|My boyfriend of 4 years told me during a fight that the only reason he would consider marrying me is because he wouldn't be able to find a better c*cksucker|"it's been 2 weeks but I can't get over this. I felt disrespected and can't bring myself to forgive him. We have had other fights but I never disrespected him, just stated things that bothered me in our relationship to make it better and healthier for both. Am I too sensitive for reacting like I did? I packed my things and moved back with my parents and haven't answered his calls since that.

Edit for context: my boyfriend has a history of drug abuse and has been sober for 1 year (or that's what I thought). A little over a month ago I found some things in his car and I brought up the subject as gently as I could (it's not light things like weed or such). He decided to leave the house for 2 hours and when he came back I decided to keep silent because I know its difficult to handle a situation like this and I didnt want to upset him. Two weeks ago he was talking about getting married and having kids and I said that I would love that but I am worried about his habits and him lying to me about his struggles. So that's when things got nasty. He has said a lot of things in the past years but in a specific state so I always thought it was the drugs doing the talking and tried to not feel sad about it. That night he was sober when he said that. I can't help but feel like that's his real opinion because he didnt feel guilty afterwards and he didn't apologize until 2 days afterwards through text messages. I know addiction is hard (I have my own not drug related) but now it just feels like he doesn't care about how I feel.

Edit2: Thank you for all your comments. One person suggested to talk again as a final chat with him to close the chapter. I will try to do that. I also want to clarify that I do love him and in my mind I can't picture myself with someone else. That being said, these weeks I realised how much I have been ignoring my own needs and felt dead inside to make this relationship work and I really want to learn to love myself too."|carolinsbackpack|False|https://redd.it/ekx9lh|216|0.93|0|93|1|relationship_advice

 My sister is in federal law enforcement. She met this guy through a mutual friend of ours a year and a half ago. She's been dating him for a year and three months. He's a programmer. I don't know exactly what he does, but it's in that field. 

This past December, my sister asked my parents if they would be okay with her bringing him over for lunch and then going to his parents for dinner. My mum was okay with it, but my dad didn't really take it well. He started to bring up my sister's ex boyfriend and commentated how that guy was a real man and could protect my sister. It then turned into what I've been told was a big argument and some dirty laundry was brought up. My sister ended up skipping Christmas all together with our family and went to his. She told me that she just wanted to spend to the day together. 

Today my mum invited my sister to her house to talk. I was there for this unlike the innital confrontation. My dad started immediately about how he liked her ex boyfriend so much better than her current boyfriend because he was in the military. He cheated on her and that's why they broke up. My sister and dad once again got into an argument about her current boyfriend. The jist of it is that he doesn't think his job is manly, can protect my sister and doesn't think he can accept her boyfriend into the family. 

My sister's birthday is coming up. She invited me and my mum, but told our dad he could stay at home and rot in his missery. Said she loves her boyfriend and to deal with it. She said she's planning on moving in with him later in the year at around August. My mum asked me to help her get through to my dad, but I'm at a loss as to what I can even do."|PoElodis|False|https://redd.it/ekp31f|1975|0.98|0|313|1|relationship_advice

eklljy|2020-01-06 00:15:46|I was pregnant and my boyfriend left me. I’m not anymore and he wants to get back together.|"I was dating my boyfriend since we were 17 and we’re in the middle of our second year of college. To be honest, we tried to be safe and use condoms every time but sometimes he’d go promise to pull out or we weren’t careful and things would get messy if you know what I mean. Well, I found out during November that I was pregnant. It was a really bad time for me, literally the week before my final exams. And he was really upset. He accused me of cheating on him and he said the baby wasn’t his. Obviously I never cheated on him. He said I’d have to get an abortion. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do so I said no and that I’d need time to think about what I’m gonna do. It was only the beginning anyway and I just wanted to think about it first. He just got mad and said he wasn’t taking care of a baby and he broke up with me and stormed out and wouldn’t talk to me. I tried to contact him and he wouldn’t reply to my texts or open the door if I came to his apartment. It was horrible he was really ignoring me like he just wanted nothing to do with me 

I found out when I went to the doctor that I may have had a miscarriage or something. Anyway basically I wasn’t pregnant anymore. After some time, I decided to tell him just so he wasn’t thinking I was still pregnant. I texted him asking if we could meet up and talk and he didn’t reply and then I told him I wasn’t pregnant and suddenly he replied and said ok he wants to see me. We talked and I told him I had a miscarriage and he seemed to completely do a 180. He was worried and asking me if I felt okay and he was being sweet. And he wants to get back together now.

eku3oc|2020-01-06 13:24:03|Should I tell my neighbour that her husband is cheating?|"Long time lurker first time poster.

I very recently found out that my neighbour (C) husband (M) is cheating on her with her cousin (L)

So I have security camera’s installed all around my house and last night I decided to check the camera’s as I hadn’t checked it in nearly a fortnight. 

Now what I saw on the security camera has completely shocked me. My back garden camera’s had captured M leaning on the side of my shed with L and she was giving him oral sex. 

I decided to then check out the rest of my recordings and noticed that there were many recordings of them preforming sexual acts on each other throughout the two weeks. 

They even had the audacity to go in my shed a couple times and do what ever nastiness they could dream up. 

My neighbour C is a lovely woman and a dedicated mother and wife and over the last couple months me and her have started to build something of a friendship. 

Her husband M has always been polite and friendly towards me and I’ve never had any issue with him, in fact I actually liked him too. L the cousin of C moved in with C&amp;M almost a year ago after a terribly nasty  divorce and we’ve had the occasional hi and how are yous. 

Now I’m really angry that M&amp;L went into my space without permission and I really want to call them out on this but I also don’t want to hurt C.

If this was me I would’ve appreciated C telling me that my husband was cheating on me but understand that some don’t appreciate that level of honesty.

I don’t know what to do. What should I do? Do I tell her? Or do I tell M&amp;L that I know? Or do I do nothing and ignore it?  Like what do I do?

——————Update—————

I’ve decided to tell C because I care about her and would want her to tell me if it was me. 

I will be inviting C over for tea and I’ll simply give it to her straight. I will be showing her the footage IF she wants to see it but I won’t allow her to have a copy of it or allow her to film/take pictures of it.
I just don’t want this to be used by her in anger as “revenge porn” or something to shame them with. 

I also won’t report M&amp;L to the police as they have children and jobs they’d likely lose if they have a criminal record. They are terrible people who’ve done a terrible thing but I won’t further destroy their lives even if they deserve to face the consequences of their morally inexcusable and illegal actions."|_Misz_|False|https://redd.it/eku3oc|156|0.95|0|43|1|relationship_advice

ekwngr|2020-01-06 16:48:58|I'm(32M) not ready to propose, but I'm tired of breaking my girlfriend's(29F) heart.|"My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost three years(it will be three years this March), and she's been putting on the pressure for me to propose since last year. Basically, we had been together for a little over a year when she started asking about engagement. The problem is, I just don't feel ready yet. I know I'm not super young and that many guys propose and get married at my age or younger, but I feel like that just isn't me. 

I'm afraid that we overlooked a major incompatibility when we first started dating, which is she is someone who has always known she wanted to be married and have a family, ever since she was a little girl. It's basically been her dream. I, on the other hand, have never had that dream. In fact, I was the one in my teens and early twenties saying I never want to be married. Now, that has changed a bit, and I do see a day when I'd like to be married and have a kid or two, but not now. Not next year. Not even in the next five years. It's just not something that I really see for myself anytime soon.

She thinks that if she doesn't get engaged sometime this year, then she is some sort of failure or something, and I really don't want to be limited to a timeframe that I'm obligated to propose within. Last year, I told her I wasn't comfortable with it yet, and she eventually convinced me to do it sometime this year. Basically, she cried and threw a fit and was depressed until I gave in. The thing is I really am in love with her and cannot stand to see her unhappy, so I said I'd do it, genuinely believing I'd be ready if a little more time passed. Now that this year is here, I realize I really don't feel any different than before. The other day I told her I still didn't feel ready and it was aweful. She cried, said she hated me, said I'm ruining her life and wasting her time. I think that's unfair to say, but I definitely understand where she's coming from. I want her to be happy, but I'm just not sure I can make her happy without compromising who I am as a person. If I agreed to propose this year to make her happy, then I'm doing it just for her, and not for myself, which doesn't seem like it will last. I'd hate to break her heart and really can't stand to see her cry, and I want her to be happy but, I just don't know if I'm ready to settle down.

It occurred to me that I may have to break up with her, but it's hard to imagine a life without her at this point. The thing is, if I do give in and just do what she wants, I may end up happy in the long run, but I'm just not sure. I also might regret it because it's not really what I wanted."|hiitsme816|False|https://redd.it/ekwngr|59|0.73|0|118|1|relationship_advice

I think my posts were removed so unsure why. Regardless, perhaps this is a premature update because I haven't actually spoken to my gf yet. 

But basically I've spent all day mulling over what to do. And honestly, I think it's time for me to end this relationship. I'm tired of being seen as the boring safe guy. I want to be with someone who looks at me and wants every part of me. Someone who looks at me and just genuinely is thrilled by me. I don't want to be the stable guy who she doesn't get turned on by. 

I'm incredibly depressed at the moment (been drinking a lot too, doesn't help), but this is only short term and I know that I'll feel better at some point. It's just that I would rather be alone than be with someone and feel resentment.

I'm going to still have a talk with her and lay this all out. Either I'll update to this thread or just make a separate one for it. Will likely talk to her tomorow morning. I'm going to sleep somewhere else tonight. 

Thank you all for the advice though. I had conflicting advice. Maybe my ego is fragile. Maybe I am being weak and insecure..but I'm just tired of living life being ""that guy"" who always lives.life on the sidelines."|Throwaway2o2p2|False|https://redd.it/ekz0n8|27|0.71|0|91|1|relationship_advice

After not seeing the woman he left my mother for for years, they are now back together and she is living with him. 

Yesterday, he came into my house, swore me to secrecy, and then told me that they are going to get married, and want to have a baby. Specifically, ""she wants a baby and I wouldn't mind it..."" --he then proceeds to tell me that he is ""shooting blanks"" and wants my genetics. He says that I'd be absolved from being the father... But also my dad is 67 and not particularly healthy--he was relatively aware about the fact that he would probably die before this kid is in high school. 

Also, my father is financially independent, but as you might gather by now, bat shit crazy. He's likely experiencing some level of onset dementia, and also historically has rage issues and some type of undiagnosed personality disorder.

el0gcg|2020-01-06 21:15:13|How should I (21F) talk to my sister (18F) about how she dresses without slut-shaming or criticizing her own sexuality?|"This is pretty straightforward. This summer I noticed that my youngest sister, who is in her last year of high school, had started to hang out with a new crowd. One of her closest friends had started dating a guy in this group, and soon my sister was hanging out with them as well. I thought a few of these guys and girls were a bit sketchy, but I figured that she would learn that herself after a little while. She clearly wanted to fit in with this group, so a few issues popped up - a bit of trouble with teachers, a couple times she arrived home pretty drunk from parties, and an obvious shift in style that created conflict with my mom - but nothing that I thought caused me concern other than the usual teenage rebellion. She's an adult now and she'll figure it out.

The issue that I have is that she seems to have lost sight of, or not figured out, how to dress for an event. For example, a few times she has gone to job interviews (for basic retail sort of jobs to earn school money) wearing quite revealing tops and super short skirts. She had a meeting at school that was semi-serious and she wore like a tube top, basically. And the one I noticed the most was at Christmas we went to a church service and she wore the sort of thing I'd wear to a club - heels and a halter top minidress.

She's entitled to express her sexuality as she sees fit, but I want her to recognize that her fashion choices impact how people perceive her, which is important when trying to get into school, internships, jobs etc. Even a basic internet search would take an employer to her instagram which is all revealing photos etc. 

I know my mom can't really have this conversation because she already unfairly criticizes her outfits all the time. I think I'm the right person to do it, but I'm not sure how to do it without being insulting?"|Cautious_Nectarine|False|https://redd.it/el0gcg|18|0.95|0|16|1|relationship_advice

ekuted|2020-01-06 14:28:04|I'm (M32) cool with my little sis (F30) announcing her pregnancy on my birthday. How do I deal with people who aren't?|"So, my little sis told me I'm going to be an uncle a few weeks back and I was chuffed. I love family, adding more to it is great.

She's said she wants to make one big announcement to all the extended family when we next get together, which is my birthday in March. 

Honestly, I couldn't be happier. I haven't celebrated my birthday in years, I don't really like them and I don't enjoy being the centre of attention. If it wasn't for the fact my family has a thing for double digits, I'd be doing the same thing I do every year and just cracking open a beer with some buddies at my place. If sis wants to deal with the annoying aunts and fawning cousins, more power to her.

But the other people who know she's pregnant are annoyed at her for planning to take the attention away from me on ""*my day""*. My mother (F61) has been particularly vocal about how it's unfair to me, no matter how many times I say I'm fine with it and I told sis myself she had my blessing to do it. There's one aunt and a cousin who noticed sis not drinking over Christmas, they know too and insist it's dodgy for sis to announce on my birthday. 

I don't get it. My birthdays have never been big things where everyone fusses over the birthday boy. I didn't get that as a kid, let alone now I'm an adult. It's never been *my day*. It's weird that anyone's treating this as just another excuse to get together and get pissed.  That's another thing, if sis doesn't do it, everyone's going to notice she's not drinking again and it'll probably come out then anyway.

So yeah, anyone got any ideas about how to tell people to stop going on about it and that I'm fine if my birthday party (bloody hell, what am I five?) becomes a 'congrats on the baby' night instead?"|ThrowRA1982468|False|https://redd.it/ekuted|51|0.86|0|51|1|relationship_advice
eksnwx|2020-01-06 11:03:06|I (27m) just found out that my wife (25f) may be pregnant for the third time|"First post here, and honestly just need advice wherever I can find it... 

So tonight after putting our 2 lovely children to bed, I was getting out of my gym gear when my wife came into the bedroom balling her eyes out, holding a positive pregnancy test.

These were not happy tears. 

We are in a very strong relationship, with a little boy and little girl that fill our hearts with so much love and joy. 

But it is no lie that our second child definitely put a strain on our relationship in the first 6 months. 

I even found I was resenting our little girl due to the impact it was having on our relationship. 

Upon reflection, I think that my wife may have also had some post partum depression, and she agrees that may have been the case. 

All this was just temporary, and the last 12 months have been great for us. 

We have our own house, we both work and have lots of plans for our short term, and long term future. But in no way are we truly 'comfortable' financially. 

We both agree that having 2 children is perfect for us, and definitely had no plans on having a third, in fact we had off the mark discussions saying that we would get it 'dealt with' if she was to fall pregnant.

But now the situation has actually happened... and we don't know what to do.

I feel like having a third could end up driving a massive wedge between my wife and I. And then there is the fear that we would both end up resenting this child. 

Then there is the financial issue... our house is not big enough for 5 people... Our 2 kids are currently sharing a room with a bunk bed so they can use our 3rd bedroom as a toy room. 

We would also have to upgrade to a larger vehicle, which we still owe money on our current family car.

We are heavily leaning towards an abortion, but I am concerned how something like that will effect my wife's mental and physical health.

I told her I would stick by her, whatever decision we make, but have expressed my concerns about either decision to her.

We are planning to go to a clinic to find out more information, and if we do go through with an abortion,  we will see a professional counsellor to guide us through a difficult time.

So that's pretty much where we are at, and are seeking advice and perhaps other people who have been in similar situations. 

TL:DR
Wife may be pregnant with 3rd child and we are both leaning towards getting an abortion due to financial difficulties and fearing it may be too hard on our relationship."|monkeyvagina|False|https://redd.it/eksnwx|90|0.91|0|89|1|relationship_advice
ekul9w|2020-01-06 14:08:39|My partner is likely depressed but refuses to acknowledge it because they “don’t have any reason to be depressed”. I’m feeling resentful.|"Throwaway for reasons 

My partner is exhibiting symptoms of major depressive disorder. Despite that, they dismiss it (or at best, sometimes they will just minimize it and say it’s not “a big deal”). They believe they have no reason to be depressed because they have a good paying job and live a good life and because others have it worse. As if someone else’s broken leg makes your broken arm hurt any less. 

Very small things will build up and their mood will spiral down in matters of minutes for the rest of the day. For example, they won’t know how to do something. They’ll get frustrated with the task, spiral into negative self-talk about their worth (“I’m stupid because I don’t know how to do X”) which then goes into a feedback loop of “I’m stupid because I felt stupid for not knowing how to do X” and they’ll ruminate about it and be stuck in this headspace for the rest of the day - or even subsequent days. It makes it worse because they do not have a support network. They don’t have friends, their parents are unable to offer any real support (one of them is chronically/terminally ill, the other is busy taking care of them and doesn’t have much emotional labour to pass around) - aside from me, they have no real social life. They don’t have hobbies and they’ve lost interest in everything. Their routine is essentially waking up, going to work, coming home, eating dinner, drinking a couple beers, browsing Reddit, then going to bed. 


I try to be supportive. I practice active listening and will offer up things they can do (such as seeing a professional, going for walks together, doing things they enjoy - although now they’ve lost all interest). I struggle with depression so I know what it’s like to be in a dark tunnel. But I believe they’ve never addressed anything and they’re simply ill equipped to deal with it alone. I know it isn’t my responsibility to fix them so I try not to insert myself too much into it but I am beginning to feel resentful. Their anhedonia means we don’t do much together. They are indifferent about everything - be it food, going out, media consumption, sex. They’re on their phone browsing reddit most of the time so I just feel like there’s no point in me being around. I’m not trying to sound like a boomer but I do feel ignored a lot. Or they’ll just stare into nothing and not talk to me.  They also compare themself to others and let that determine their self-worth (and intelligence) and I have to be mindful of everything I do. If it takes me a week to finish a book and it takes them two weeks, they believe they’re stupid because it took me less time. 

When they have their good days, they’re good. They’re a good partner and I love them but the good days are diminishing and the bad days are growing. And it’s only going to get worse and I’m struggling with it. I don’t want to feel resentful but I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR: my partner is depressed and doesn’t want to acknowledge there’s a problem and it’s impacting us."|throwaway3973113|False|https://redd.it/ekul9w|44|0.9|0|19|1|relationship_advice

Meg doesn’t try to act feminine because of her strict family but the thing that bothered me the most was that Zelle started to make fun of Meg also. I asked Zelle what was her problem and she stated that she doesn’t like Meg because she’s a trans trender.

Zelle calls me saying that he only said that he was trans because Meg was getting more attention than she deserved. I was floored by this I had no idea to react.

Everything seemed great, things were progressing great like I thought we were on the cusp of going official. Then she went home for the holidays, communication broke down. We talked when she got back. She admitted to me that in previous relationships she has run away when things get serious and that she tends to get in her head and analyze everything. It was pretty clear that she doesn't know what she wants. I told her that I was ok with it all and that I wasn't expecting her to have everything figured out right now. At the end of the conversation I asked her if we were ok and she said that we were, but I could tell she was still unsure.

It was good that we had this talk, but deep down I had the feeling that she was eventually going to walk away. After this talk, she became more responsive and I could tell she was trying, but I could also tell that her heart didn't seem to be into it. She came over that following Saturday for a few hours. Again her heart wasn't into it. She wasn't super responsive and the affection level she displayed before was scaled back a lot. I felt like we regressed so much. If in our relationship we had taken 10 steps forward, we had taken 8 back. On top of all that, I've been the one initiating things lately. Things just don't seem to be going in the right direction. I recognize that I maybe trying to hold onto something that may already been gone...

I talked to some of my family about the whole situation, they gave me the advice of pulling back and let her come back to me. I do think this is what I need to do, but I'm not sure what that exactly means and am kind of nervous that it may back fire and I'd end up losing her altogether.

el1dgr|2020-01-06 22:18:26|Wife is having an affair|"Hello Reddit.

&#x200B;

For the past 40 days, i have been sliding into a deep depression. My wife had an affair and she left on Christmas morning.

&#x200B;

I served in the Marines for 9 years. During my time in the service, i met the love of my life, married the love of my life, and quickly realized that I need to leave the Marines. In January of last year, i began looking for jobs in the city that she was in school at (We decided to stay local because she didn't graduate until December, and her best bet at employment was to try and get a job at the hospital she did clinicals in). I had two options in front of me. I could become a cop, or i could be a UAV Operator instructor. Now. Let me begin by saying this, being a UAV instructor is incredibly boring...I could not see myself doing that job everyday. Now, being a cop? that sounded like so much fun!

&#x200B;

I decided to be a cop...I took a 50k salary over a 90k salary...my wife wasn't happy. It was around this time that i noticed that we started to fight alot, we stopped having sex, and we just could not get along.

&#x200B;

In june, we bought our first house! 179k investment...yes, we argued over what house we wanted, and what renovations we wanted...but ultimately, we closed. I also started my job as a law enforcement officer that month, and in July, i began the police academy...i was gone Monday through Thursday, and came home for Friday - Sunday. This lasted until November.

&#x200B;

Throughout my time at the academy, i didn't really talk to my wife. When i was home, i noticed that she was spending alot of time on facebook, or she was working. We did not really have alot of time together.

&#x200B;

two weeks after graduating the academy, my wife and i bought our first car together. A 2019 Toyota RAV4. On December 8th she asked for a divorce. On December 12th she graduated college.

&#x200B;

For two weeks, i tried to talk my wife out of the divorce, but she told me that all i did was play video games, that i did not show her affection, and she believed that our marriage was not save-able. I would try and talk to her every chance i got, but he stance never changed...On Christmas Eve, i found out why.

&#x200B;

I woke up on xmas eve and was about to make some coffee...but they i had this really weird feeling that i needed to check my wifes computer. Now, this computer is normally password protected...but at this particular time, when i wiggled the mouse, it went to the home screen. I opened up my wife's facebook messages, and found that she was sexting a guy that she met in a facebook photography group. I also found that they were planning on getting an apartment together in NC.

&#x200B;

Naturally, i texted my wife and told her what i found, and that we needed to talk about it. Ultimately, she left the next day and drove to NC.

&#x200B;

Now, over the 4 days that my wife and driving to another mans apartment, she keep saying that she loves me, but she just doesn't see the marriage working. She even said that she was just going to spend some time home (in VA) and then she will decide if she wants to come back.

&#x200B;

I'm heart broken. So, just like anyone else would do. I vented to anyone and everyone. my family, her family, our friends. everyone. I spiraled into a deep depression that i'm currently still in. Come to find out, the guy recently left his wife in November, when i found this out. I contacted her too! She wasn't to happier to her that her recently separated husband was already shacked up with another girl.

&#x200B;

Every single day, my wife is all i can think about. I know i annoy everyone when i constantly talk to them about her...i know i bug them...but I'm stuck in a house all alone, while she went back east.

&#x200B;

Today, after she found out that i contacted the guys wife, she told me that i was a controling, manipulative, phychopath, and that i ruin everything...She told me that all she wanted to do was relax, have fun, and figure out what she wanted in life.

&#x200B;

I'm truly broken. I don't know what to think. i don't eat. i don't sleep. I've lost 10 pounds already. I can't even think straight. This is the first time in my life that i've experienced depression, and i need help. The said part is, i just wish my wife was here to help me through all this. I love her. But i'm beginning to realize that she doesn't love me.

&#x200B;

She keeps saying that if i can prove to her that i can change to help fix the marriage, she will come back to Arizona. I want her back so bad, but honestly, i just don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

TLDR: wife and i became distant after we bought a house together. I changed Careers and have to attend a 4 month training academy for it. during the academy, my wife met another married man. She left me for him. She says that she will come back if i can prove to her that i can change to fix the marriage. I don't know what to do."|brokenmarriageAZ|False|https://redd.it/el1dgr|8|1.0|0|14|1|relationship_advice
ekyrmn|2020-01-06 19:19:38|My boyfriend and I had a bad fight last night and now I don't know how to make up with him|"Let me start by saying that there is an age difference between us so I decided not to include it in my title because I did not want that to be the main focus. Also, we have been together for 3 years now.

&#x200B;

Yesterday was a bad day for me before the fight because I already had to reprimand my 14 y/o son (not our son, he is just mine with my ex-husband) for throwing his cell phone and hitting me with it when I demanded he give it to me because he did something I have repeatedly told him not to do. That situation has already been taken care of between my son, his father, and me so I do not need any advice about it and I would prefer not to talk about it either. So as you can imagine after all of that I was hurt and in an angry mood. 

My bf tried his best to make me feel better, he was being extra sweet and even suggested he and I go somewhere just the two of us for dinner, have a few drinks and a nice time together. I was all for it until it didn't end up happening. Bf works hard and was tired so when the evening came around he wasn't really in the mood to go anywhere. I was ready for a nice night and this just irked me even more. When he realized that, he offered to go down to a little fast food place near our house. Because my mood was already sour I made a snide comment about how there was no cell reception inside the fast food place so we couldn't use our phones to distract us and we would just end up sitting there, staring at each other with nothing to say like always. He lost it. He threw his phone, not at me but in my direction and it hit the wall behind me and cracked. There was a lot of back and forth about which of us spends more time on their phone and who ignores who. It was all bad. While we were arguing he was putting on clothes and when he was dressed he said, ""Let's GO. Let's just get something to eat."" But I couldn't leave, I was a weeping mess. He said this was the only chance he was giving me, again I said I was not leaving. He undressed, got into bed, and turned on the TV. 

After a while of sitting on the side of the bed silently crying, I asked him if this, meaning us, was still working for him. I said I did not want to do this, feel this way, or be like this with him. Because I had already upset him so much he didn't really want to talk to me. Although we did apologize to each other for how we acted it somehow did not feel genuine. 

Since he stopped talking to me I left the room. Then the house. I went down the street to the gas station, bought a couple of tallboys then went back to the house, sat in the car in the yard and drank them. I called my brother to vent a little and it helped. We ended up talking for about 4 hours. It was about 1AM when I went back into the house and my bf was asleep. I took a shower, ate a bagel, and went to bed too.

But this morning... I woke up to my bf walking around the house and getting ready for work. He didn't know I was awake when I saw him walk to my side of the bed and sneakily grab my phone then go around and sit at the foot of the bed.  I stirred like I was waking up, sat up, asked what time it was, he said 6:30 AM, then I went into the bathroom. When I came back out my phone was back on my nightstand again and he was drinking a cup of coffee. I don't care that he was going to look through my phone, there's nothing on it. Any time in the past when he has ever asked me to see it, I have handed it right over. We also know each other's passcodes. I am aware that we both sometimes have suspicions about the other but we usually address them before they become a big thing, so I'm not sure what he was going to look for on my phone this morning. He left for work around 7 AM, it's now almost 2:30 PM and I have not heard from him. I know he's busy but he always texts or calls me. I know what both of us did and how we acted was really shitty, not making excuses but we were both so upset. 

I want to make up with him but I don't know how to start the conversation to do so. And what if he doesn't want to talk to me if I try? I'm looking for real advice and I know we both messed up with how we acted. Thanks for reading."|ProblematicPineapple|False|https://redd.it/ekyrmn|13|0.73|0|21|1|relationship_advice
ekxg9f|2020-01-06 17:45:49|Best way to tell my fiance that i deserve to have hobbies?|"So, context:

I'm been together with my fiance for 10 years, living together for 2.5 years. I got the board game bug in 2015 from a project friend from uni, we would play 1/2h everyday on our breaks. Haven't played since mid 2017 since uni ended.

Now, since i found from a work friend that there is a board game night every week with 50+ people (i had gone twice in 2016 when they were 5 people), also found my friends from the uni's project are there every week. I was pumped and at the same time a little sad.

I had sold all my board game more than 2 years ago to a friend, because i had no one to play them with and he had in the city he moved. Also i know my girlfriend doesn't like to play board game and that's ok, np.

I tried to buy 1 or 2 easy fast games to play with my girlfriend, she was into the idea, but when it came to play them she wasn't into it, so i scratched the idea. We as a couple are more of watching movie/series kind of a thing.

Now i have tried to go to the board game night for 4/5 weeks, but always had stuff/work to do Friday nights. Note i don't go out without her, i normally have no hobbies/stuff to do out of the comfort of my house. She however goes to the gym 6 times a week with her sister and mother. I end up doing some cleaning/cooking/etc while she is in the gym.

I love that she was something that she likes that much, i always drive her to marathons/trails and i think i support her with her hobbies.

However the first and only time i went to the board game night she was the hole time texting me, after midnight she was calling me and pushing me to go home (the game night starts at 10pm)

I ended up catching up with my friend after i ended my first game at 00:50 and lost the track of time, got home at 02:00.

She made a huge argument because she says she can't sleep without me getting home.

I ended up saying that she has something she's passionate about and i support her, when i have something i'm passionate about she craps on that.... In the argument i said i would stop going so she can get everything she wants to. I just fucking think it's not fair, but i don't want to cause problems.

Some people say I was an ass, etc... Others say that i have the right to have my own hobbies.

I ended up submitting into the to /r/AmItheAsshole and there they agreed i'm not the asshole. 

How should i bring this up to her? I don't won't an argument, i really don't want her to be mad, but i want my position to be respected. I feel frustrated because this is normally not a problem, we are usually very respectful of each other.

I feel like i'll lose if i stopped going or if i keep going... lose lose situation."|SorryMateL|False|https://redd.it/ekxg9f|17|0.85|0|25|1|relationship_advice

I know he’s broke right now so I wasn’t expecting any sort of expensive gift or dinner but he didn’t even make me a card or buy some $5 drugstore flowers. Just said “Happy birthday!” And tried to give me “birthday sex”...By the end of the day, I realized he really didn’t have anything planned at all and I was a little upset/quiet so when he asked me what was wrong, I told him that I was a little hurt that he didn’t do anything to celebrate my birthday.... so he immediately turned it around on me and said he was planning on cooking me dinner and rushed to the store last minute to buy some things to cook. 

I feel so upset, not because he didn’t buy me a gift/do anything to celebrate, but because of the lack of thought he had for me. He says he wants to marry me but I feel like he is so ungrateful for everything I do for him. This past month I almost drained my bank account supporting the both of us/covering him and I just expected at the very least a thoughtful card from this man who claims to want to marry me. 

Am I being a brat here? I did a lot to celebrate his birthday also, which he requested. (Dinner at his fav restaurant, thoughtful gift, birthday cake, went to his fav bar) and even though he’s broke I felt like he could’ve done SOMETHING nice for me that didn’t cost any money—like wash my car, make a homemade gift, etc.

What does this mean? Am I just being a brat about my bday?"|throwaway5677654321|False|https://redd.it/ekmjqm|282|0.94|0|80|1|relationship_advice

ekox72|2020-01-06 04:39:24|Very new relationship, don't know if I should accept what happened or leave while it's still young.|"So for some background I had come out of a 3 year relationship with a guy that betrayed my trust multiple times. I had told my new boyfriend about my ex messaging other girls and how it made me feel. I had told him so we could cultivate a really open and honest relationship because I wouldn't accept that kind of betrayal happening again. 

I found messages the other night on his phone where he was aggressively flirting with someone that he had a fling with about 8 months ago. They also saw each other in the time that we've been dating and he didnt tell me, I don't believe that anything physical happened though. 

He betrayed my trust in the only way I asked him not to, even though it was a ""harmless"" thing that he did, he knew how that affects my self esteem.

ekwuk3|2020-01-06 17:02:47|Curious to hear your thoughts on the marriage topic|"So I, 28 F, and my boyfriend, 31, have been together for 3 years now. Lately, the topic of marriage has been peaking its head. Whether between us or friends asking when the big day will come. I've always pictured myself getting married, it was like a obvious life milestone that you just do when you find the right person. The thought of marrying my boyfriend leaves me with no anxiety or fear. He's my forever person. Why not get married. 

When we talked to one another about it he said he's sure that this is it. But just not yet. Admittedly, I was hurt. Well, why not right? We're both sure about each other so why prolong? I asked this and there really was no concrete answer. He just said it was a feeling, he's just not there yet. To him marriage also means kids, and he's not ready to be a dad. We continued to ask each other questions, what does marriage mean to you, what would it really change, etc. The take away was that we both agreed it wouldn't actually change anything. Financials aside. 

He told me marriage wouldn't change his commitment to me. He's in this forever. Marriage wouldn't change the love between us. So sure, we love each other, we're committed, why not get marriage. But on the other hand, why get married at all. 

Will our kids have any less stability without it? Will they feel like we love each other or them any more because we are legally bound to each other? Isn't it actually more beautiful that we choose to be with each other, respect each other, without any legal bound that may be tying us to the decision. Seems to me that not getting married can actually mean more than taking ""the leap"".

I've always pictured myself getting married. But I never really thought about why.  Now that I found my lobster it seems like I don't need it. The conservative family will be upset, but that's no reason. I don't see our every day changing or being any better because we followed in what society tells us is the normal thing to do. 

If we do get married, things stay the same. If we don't, things still say the same. So why?

Anyway, there's my rant. Would love to hear what you have to say. Why did you and your spouse decide to get married? Why did you decide not to?"|Blah1231248|False|https://redd.it/ekwuk3|13|0.78|0|29|1|relationship_advice

ekytlv|2020-01-06 19:23:14|Boyfriend (M21) crashed my (F20) car, and I’m struggling to get over it.|"In August 2019 I bought my car. It was a real cheap car that was older than me but I loved it. In October 2019, I ended up in the hospital and my boyfriend of over 2 years came to visit me everyday. He doesn’t have a car, and I couldn’t use mine so he used mine. After taking a friend to come visit me one day, I get a call a couple minutes after they left saying that he got into an accident. My friend and bf were taken to the hospital and both were okay but my car was not. Days later I get the call that the car was indeed totaled. 

Now this was months ago, and I still can’t get over it. I know that he did not mean to make my life harder, but it has. It feels like a large piece of my independence was taken away. He has apologized numerous times and has tried to help me as much as possible but I am still upset and angry. I don’t want to be angry at him because I know he didn’t intend any of this but I still am. Every time I think I have moved on, it pops up again. Example: I now have to take 2 buses to get groceries (which is a pain in the butt). I asked if he could come with me one day and when he couldn’t I got incredibly upset with him and brought up the car accident like “well you should help me because you’re the one who put me in this situation”. He’s doing the best he can and gets upset when I mention it, which is why I’ve tried to just get over it. But it’s clear that I can’t. 
Any advice on how to let this go? 

PS- this is my first post and my boyfriend suggested that I do this in order to try to move past this/help our relationship

I'm (F 20) having a hard time being able to talk to people and just trying to maintain a relationship either friendship/romance.  I am a sophomore in college and I've meet some people that where in my major and we clicked with but over the months I saw their true colors and their viewpoints don't align with mine. So I barley talk to some of them, while others live to far away or unable to hangout with me.  I've tried joining clubs, like the LGBT club and improv but they all seem like in there own set of friendships that I feel like I am intruding on them.  Every time I try to make plans, either everyone is busy or they don't like what I plan.  I feel like this is just like high school where I felt like I had ""friends"" but I always felt like the outcast.  I want to forget about highschool but it's hard when you had a group full of people you are able to talk to and then suddenly you are going to community college by yourself.  Also it's hard to try to get out when you are a closted bisexual girl that lives in a somewhat catholic mexican family.

Also, there is this one guy (M 19) in the group, that I don't really enjoy being around him when we are alone.  When we are alone, he just likes talking about all his personal problems to me and just giving me the emotional stress.  I've tried helping him but he always waves it away like something he doesn't want to try. Although, if I tell him my stress or concerns he tells me that they aren't such a big deal and should just get over it. I'm not sure if my emotions are getting in the way but when my BDay came along, I asked the group chat if anyone wanted to come over. Only one person responded, which was someone I liked. Then a few hours later, my aunt is telling me to hurry up and look nice that one of my friends is here. I ask her who and she says the guys nickname. I was surprised and pissed that he came over with no clarification if he was coming or not.  I feel like I'm thinking to much about it but I feel like if I give you an invitation to my house then I'm going to assume you aren't coming. I just felt like he was violating my space by being there unannounced. 

Ps. This is all done on my phone and I'm sorry for any errors and how long it is.

Pps. I have a school therapist that i talk to twice a week but with the school break. I can't. So all these emotions are just piling up and would love some help!"|yessthemess|False|https://redd.it/el1ger|4|1.0|0|0|1|relationship_advice

He wants children. 

I’m a maybe, at best. I’m not a definite yes nor no. I guess I’m a r/fencesitter. I don’t hate kids, but I don’t like the responsibility of them. I don’t think the sacrifices that you have to make for children are worth it in my eyes. So I’ve always been eh on the idea. Maybe once I’m comfortable with my career and in my thirties who knows. 

I don’t know if my feelings will change which is why I can’t tell myself to rule out kids or make the commitment to have them. 

We’ve been discussing going to couples therapy but I don’t know how that will help or what will come from it. 

If it helps, my boyfriend is very much on board with a surrogate or adoption if I don’t want to carry/have a bio kid. And I do appreciate that he isn’t being pressuring at all. He’s also not expecting me to stay home or give up my career, etc. 

I made a throwaway just so this isn’t attached to my account but he is well aware this post isn’t being made, and he also uses Reddit so hi baby! 

So anyway, is it just an inevitable breakup? 

TLDR: Boyfriend wants kids, he is being very mature and understanding about my feelings, but I’m a solid maybe at best due to not wanting the responsibility or to sacrifice freedoms for it."|throwRAughkids|False|https://redd.it/ekx5dv|10|0.67|0|32|1|relationship_advice

This kind of control, jealousy and complaints, makes me think living with her would be a hell.

She is very conservative and thinks her attitude is normal. She has deeply snooped my cellphone and email. So if I chat with someone that I had some romantic or sexual interest in the past it generates an immediate fight even if I state clearly to that person that I am in a relationship and speak only like friends. My girlfriend won’t accept that. She will get infuriated reminding me we exchanged hot pics or something like that in the past.

I kind of understand that as I am also a little jealous and she doesn’t have male friends as she says guys are only interested in sleeping with her. 

But I also had a close female friend with whom we never had a sexual or romantic interest. My friend didn’t like my girlfriend as she got angry about me having contact with my friend.

The bad attitude between each other grew and got to the point in which my girlfriend made me choose between her and my friend. Of course, my girlfriend is more important in my life. But I feel that she is putting me in a jail and I should not allow this.

Our problem in our arguments was always the same, me being lazy or a procrastinator, which I have almost completely resolved since becoming a father, I have to do more things for her, keeping me busy but I know I'm not perfect because I still have a way to go --- and the way she argues. I mean, when she argues, it's like bloody warfare. I generally like to say ""hey, I know I did something wrong, I will try not to do it in future, I'm sorry I hurt your feeling but the way you reacted was cruel rude etc, and I was hurt too, so can we talk about it?"" She would argue like ""you offended me or annoyed me, I'm upset, you don't have a right to talk to me for hours, or a day, I'm going to say things to you on messenger that's very cruel to hurt you, not listening to your agrument how you were hurt and solely focus on how I feel. I will then say I'm alone even though I shut you out, and make you feel miserable today.""

... I tried everything, addressing it maturely, begging her, bringing it up out of the blue or even ignoring it and trying to move on even if she offended me. None works. I'm not, disclaimer, claiming I'm perfect. I'm not. I have my problems, but I feel the difference is I know them and want to improve, and she doesn't want to hear them and she is right all the time, and if I mention or hint the argument got worse because of her comments she thinks I'm saying ""your 100% at fault not me"". I tried. 

I don't have friends to be open with, my family is here on holidays in her country, I speak the language Enough to get by but I don't have groups for support, and I feel if she complains about me to friends I am the villian because she told her side only. I am lost. She just told me she won't talk to me even if it's related to helping our daughter, I cannot speak with her. She ignores me in front of her parents and it my parents come who are on holidays, will have their son miserable and they not knowing where to go or how to speak the language, and she's claiming she's alone and hurt, despite she pushed herself away and doesn't want to talk about it. She mentioned a while ago how much she's annoyed at her mother as she is actually similar to her in the sense she won't admit what she did wrong and pull the victim card. I always supported her and the second it's the other way around its different. I mentioned she should go to a therapist, but she doesn't think she needs, and she definitely feels pain and stress, she's using the pregnancy after birth as an scapegoat yet we had these arguments since we are together. Since she was born, I was unable to put as much attention on my wife as normal, especially with my parents here who constantly need a translator, I told her it should be temporary and I'm trying, but she doesn't want to listen. Please, has anyone else been in my shoes? I feel like I'm completely lost, and even if I feel like I'm right in what I say, I always walk away feeling guilty and horrible. I just want to help her, as she's only like this in arguments, otherwise I love her to death. 

I am just worried about our relationship because she doesn't want to admit there's a percentage wrong she is doing that doesn't help the situation, without her thinking I'm saying that I'm perfect and she's awful. I like to think there are 3 sides to every story, I know mine, I want to know hers but mostly she expects me to know her side already without talking to me at all."|ThrowRa76543|False|https://redd.it/ekx7kh|8|0.68|0|12|1|relationship_advice

eko6ls|2020-01-06 03:36:08|The guy (24m) I (23f) like cried in my arms today|"Hi reddit. Never posted here before but I’m in a predicament. Also I’m on mobile so sorry in advance. 

Recently I have been hanging around this guy who is in my group of friends. We met about 6 months ago because I was dating one of his friends. It wasn’t anything serious and didn’t go past a few dates. Anyway, I’ve been spending time with this group more often and he’s always around. We hit it off when we’re together and always seem to have fun in groups. More recently we’ve spent some time alone, but strictly as friends. This alone time has made me realize I definitely have feelings for him. 

He has had a rough few months. He was in a pretty serious car accident back in November and has only recently got his health back to normal. Him and his girlfriend also broke up right around the same time. I know he’s been struggling a lot and he’s been open with me (and the rest of our friends) about how the break up has been hard for him even though it seems their break up was inevitable. In his words it had been rocky for a while before the break up actually happened. I know his ex hasn’t been the nicest towards him since their break up and I feel bad. She’s said some pretty nasty things to him and I know it bothers him. He is the sweetest guy and he deserves better. 

So today, we had plans to take our dogs on a walk. I was going to walk to his apartment since it is right near the park we usually take our dogs to. When I got to his apartment, I could immediately tell something was off so I asked him what was wrong. It was then that he started crying. And it wasn’t like one or two tears either, it was like a lot of crying. At first I didn’t know how to react so I just started hugging him which I feel like only made him cry harder. We sat on the couch for a while and I tried asking him what was wrong but he wouldn’t really say anything too much. I asked him if it was about his ex and he said yes. After a while he calmed down and apologized and seemed embarrassed. He said he was okay but I wasn’t really sure what to say. I eventually left and we didn’t end up taking our dogs on a walk as originally planned. He texted me later to apologize again and asked me if I wanted to hang out tomorrow after work. 

I guess I’m just wondering how I’m supposed to act now? Should I bring it up again or just let it go? I still obviously have feelings for him and want to continue spending time with him because I really do like him. This has just thrown me for a bit of a loop. I was planning on making some sort of move in the near future but now I’m not sure I should. Should I just keep it friendly or make it known I’m interested? 

TLDR: The guy I liked cried in front of me today about his ex. Should I still pursue him romantically or just keep it friendly? I have feelings for him but don’t want to push him."|spicynovember|False|https://redd.it/eko6ls|98|0.92|0|29|1|relationship_advice

eky74r|2020-01-06 18:39:21|I'm the Other Man (26M, 30F)|"I know these types of posts usually end up getting downvoted or the advice boils down to ""just leave them"", but I think this situation is a little different. Even if it's not, I just need to share and hopefully someone understands.

For some context, we're coworkers. We have a job where we stand within a few feet of each other pretty much all day. Needless to say, we talk a lot and know way too much about one another. This is how the relationship bloomed. I won't say love at first sight, but we've talked about how there's been a constant magnetism between us since that moment.

I know most extramarital relationships start on the basis of sex which then leads to feelings. Ours is just the opposite. Hours of conversation, texting each other every single day (even when she was on vacation), sending each other music, sharing lunches, eventually hanging out outside of work. Going to concerts, singing together, sharing jokes and laughter and things only we understand, saying good morning and good night. Everything just clicked. I had never believed in the idea of a soulmate, and now I don't have any other word to describe it. I know how cheesy it sounds, but it was like something out of a movie and I felt lucky every day.

The pull was so strong, I just couldn't bring myself to make a move because of her situation. This was after her telling me she is in an 'open relationship'. Obviously I trust her, though I have no way of knowing if this is true. I'm sure there are people in healthy open relationships but to me it was a sign that things weren't going well. She would tell me about how she thought her husband was sleeping with someone else in their apartment, which was apparently the one rule. Even still, she had become my best friend and I didn't want to risk losing that.

Things continue like this until one day we're watching a movie on my couch, and I just can't take it any more. I pull her in, we kiss, the sex is the best either of us have ever had. Obviously this changes things in our relationship and we can't contain our feelings any more. She came with me to my sister's Halloween party and in a drunken haze afterwards I told her I loved her. She was sober, but she didn't hesitate to take me in her arms and say it right back. She admits that even though she said she was in an 'open relationship', she had never done anything like this before and was just as scared as I was. It was me, not the promise of excitement that lured her in. Our love blossoms, she makes me feel things I've never felt, like my heart is melting inside of my chest. I've never just known something the way I know that I love her, and every time we admit our feelings the other feels exactly the same.

I never wanted to talk about her marriage and neither did she. It already killed me being the other person, I know how I would feel if it were me... but at the same time, I couldn't pass up a chance at happiness that I've never known. I guess I just thought I would show her how much I love her, and hope she couldn't live without it. One night, she sobs in my arms and I know what's tearing her up inside. I'll never forget how she sounded, it shredded my heart into a million pieces. I knew something had to change eventually, I just wanted that moment of our lives to last.

And then the other shoe dropped. One day, she tells me with tears in her eyes that her husband got a job in Colorado. I was devastated in an instant. And then she tells me she made up an excuse to stay, something about finishing school, just so she could stay with me for a little longer. I don't know how to feel... elated that she's staying for me, or heartbroken because she's still leaving? She gives me a choice, either she can leave right away or we can have a little more time together. I know in my heart that I can never choose for her to leave, so there's my answer. Eventually she tells me they had split for the time being, though I didn't know what that meant since they lived together. He goes to visit Colorado so we spend a few days in bliss.

About a week or so ago after he returned, I notice she's a little distant, a little distracted. I pull her aside and ask her whats wrong. She tells me they had a conversation and have decided to try to work things out... she says she can't give in to her feelings for me because they're so strong it terrifies her. I believe that, because I feel it too. I tell her that if she's going to stay with me, she has to be with me and show me her love, because changing is just as bad as leaving.

Here we are, in a situation I never dreamed I'd be stuck in. We both know we're screwed. I want her to stay more than anything in my entire life, but I can't ask her to destroy her own. She asks me, ""where were you four years ago?"" and my mind can't stop imagining what could have been. I hadn't cried for years before I met her and now I'm crying every day. I'm so scared because I'm not only going to lose the woman I love, but I'm also going to lose my best friend. I'm not sure I'll be able to work at my job when everything has a memory tied to her. And just like all of these situations, the worst part is no one will ever even know our love existed, or why I'll be so sad once she's gone. Last night, she told me she thinks she'll be done with life after she leaves and yet she's still set on going. I know it sounds like she's choosing him over me, but I truly believe she's just scared of the consequences and the change and the possibility of throwing her life away for something that might not work out. All of which seems fair to me, even if I hate it.

If you read all of this, I truly thank you. There's so much more I could say, which is partly which I don't talk about it. I don't feel like I could ever explain the whole picture. It might make it more painful in the end, but I think I'm just going to enjoy her while I have her and hope that she comes around. I know people will probably just tell me to move on, and I honestly wish I could. I'll listen to anything you think I need to hear. What should I do?  Should I try to hold on? Should I keep being a part of her life after she leaves, because I know she doesn't want to lose me completely?"|ThrowRAonastring|False|https://redd.it/eky74r|7|0.61|0|35|1|relationship_advice
el1gbh|2020-01-06 22:23:58|Difficulty empathizing with girlfriend|"Hey guys. I just got back together with my girlfriend. We broke up awhile ago due to many reasons. One reason was cause I could not connect with her emotionally or on a deeper level. I took a year break from her but we recently decided to get back together. I don’t want to repeat the same mistakes as before.

She recently told me some difficult news about her family and I don’t know if I am supporting her properly. I am worried that my support is not correct. Also worried what I am doing is wrong. I’ve read online that it’s important to be a good listener however, it is hard for her to open up so there is not much listening. it’s more of me having to ask questions but I am also worried if my questions are meaningless. Can anyone offer advice?"|marcuslin|False|https://redd.it/el1gbh|3|1.0|0|4|1|relationship_advice
el1dy7|2020-01-06 22:19:24|Confronted my wife (30F) and she admitted to not being in love with me (32M) for possibly years now|"TD;DR near the bottom.

Me and my wife have been married for 9 years and for the most part things are going rather smoothly. We get along just fine, even today. We had our first and only child 3 years ago and it's been harder than we thought, especially for her as she didn't enjoy motherhood nearly as much as she expected. 

2019 has been an absolute shit year for me, started struggling with some to-this-day still undiagnosed chronic pain in the form of a constant, 24/7 headache that started pretty much 1 year ago and hasn't left me for even one hour since. Add to this that I've gone through 2 burnouts in 2 years, have been at the helm of a dying small company for the last 3-4 years working 60-80 hours a week hardly bringing in more than 20-30k/year. Add to this a crazy health breakdown that had my doctor test me for multiple sclerosis (thank god at least *that* turned out to be negative). Add to all of this that the daycare where my son was going closed without any warning and we had to make a decision quick, so me having a dying work-from-home business and my wife being employed, it was sort of ""evident"" that I had to leave my job behind to take care of our son, but this happened while I was waiting to be tested for MS and at the worst of my headache. It fucking broke me for months. Meds were making me dumb as a fucking rock and were changing every 4-6 weeks since nothing worked.

So I lost my job, career's dead, chronic pain, was scared I had MS, stayed-at-home with the kid but I didn't exactly do a good job caring for him or taking care of the house either... Last October I had plans made for my suicide. Luckily I've since found a few management tools. Hoping to get rid of this for good in 2020.

So anyway, for some time now I felt my wife was becoming more and more distant. She didn't want to talk to me as much, or at least never *about* me. I'd hear about her day for an hour, then I'd speak about mine and ""wait wait, I need to do something"" or whatever.  You get the idea. She never touched me, never complimented me, never want to cuddle. Sex was awkward as fuck for some reason I couldn't pinpoint, but I mean I can be pretty dense I guess... Really felt like I was chasing someone who wanted to be left alone. For months I thought ""well being young parents is stressful"", ""well being married to a sick man is probably hard"" or ""well I'm not much of a man right now...""

But yesterday I just asked her directly what was up. And well yeah. She loves me ""as a close friend"" and doesn't feel much more of anything else for me. She said ""You know, ***WE grew apart*** these last few years"" and then I told her I didn't feel that way at all, made her notice how I always ask her to just stay with me in bed and talk, or get on the same sofa when we watch something rather than sit across the damn room, or how I still play in her hair or massage her back, or how I still compliment her pretty much daily, or how I still legit want to know how her day went... and I saw her eyes open wide as she sort of went ""oh shit"" and from there it was pretty much me and her crying and wondering what the hell we do from there. She says she doesn't want to consult btw, which is one of the first things I asked her about.

She doesn't really know how it happened. I mean it's not like she intended it that way I guess. My career and health probably played a major role in this shit show. I guess I just became someone she can still love as a friend but who she doesn't find seductive? Like the poor health, bad mood due to the health and the burnouts, I've got a little dad bod going on... I don't know.

So anyway. My real question to all of you people today and where I'm kind of lost right now is:

**TD;DR**: I'm still in love with my wife but she now sees me as a close friend and not as a romantic partner (but she *does* want to bring it back). I feel like it's kind of ""up to her"" at this point, but what actions could/should I personally take to make things better?

I've got a couple clear cues. I'm seeing a therapist since November. I'll be changing field and going back to school next September. I've been steadily going to the gym since December. I'm still a fucking wreck of a human being tbh but I feel like the main step I can personally take here is to build myself back up. Is everything else ""up to her""? Or is it all me perhaps? Like I just failed her and that's it? We both have no fucking clue where to go from here, like ""what makes someone falls in love with someone else""?"|ThrowRA_letsfixit|False|https://redd.it/el1dy7|3|1.0|0|3|1|relationship_advice
ekokiy|2020-01-06 04:08:58|24 male late bloomer. Was I right to break up with a girl who genuinely adored me, but I felt wasn't right?|"I am a 24 year old late bloomer. For most of my life, I have had a bit of a tough time with dating. I wasn't bullied per se, but I didn't really have a sense of belonging in junior high and high school. I did date a bit in University, but I didn't get a ton of attention. A few years ago, I think I turned my life around. I have gotten in really good shape, and I actually believe I'm a good looking man. I have a career job that is going very well up to this point - I am making nearly 100K a year. I have my own apartment. I have mainly been through different flings - a series of about 10 or 15 short term dates with different girls I've met through apps, or some real life connections too. Despite this, I feel like my romantic capabilities are by far my biggest insecurity. I've only *really* been close to one other woman in my life, and we couldn't be together due to her family. Plus, I have other baggage too. I am a decent big allergic to cats and dogs.

About 2 months ago, this woman named ""Mathilda"" came into my life. We met through a mutual friend. To be honest, I was never really crazy about her. On our dates, we had reasonably little in common, but it felt like we shared the same family values, and I felt comfortable with her. All in all, I probably saw her around 10 times, and we texted nearly daily. She slept over a few times, but I had some sexual performance issues. I would say that's a combination of anxiety, and feeling like a break up was coming near.

I feel like Mathilda genuinely liked me for who I am. She saw me as a sweet and stable guy, and I know she wanted me to be her boyfriend. I absolutely felt the same way - I was looking forward to bringing her home to meet my parents.

However, it started feeling not right for me. Mathilda was incredibly kind, but it felt like we were incapable of being on the same wavelength. I'm a pretty energetic, active person with a ton of different hobbies. She's definitely a homebody type, with lots of close friends. The last few times she came over, we literally just cuddled, kissed, and fooled around for hours upon hours watching The Office. Which was absolutely amazing, but I don't think she would ever be interested in the 'shit' I want to do.  *The straw that broke the camel's back for me was we went to a restaurant last night, and literally had nothing to talk about. It felt like an awkward first date*. We have basically never had anything to talk about, outside of family and jobs. Plus, she made no attempt to pay half at all, and didn't say thank you. 

When we were lying in bed last night, she asked  'what are we,' and I (after much hesitation) told her that ""I was taking it day by day, and that I really like her, although I feel like we don't have much in common."" She did sleep over the rest of the night, but both of us felt a bit crushed. We texted today, and I basically just said versions of the above. That I liked her, but felt it wasn't the right fit for the long haul. She sent me very touching texts basically saying her version of the same - that she thought I was really sweet, and will miss me, but agreed the fit wasn't right.

I have basically spent the rest of my day feeling terrible. I cried my eyes out. Here is a pretty, kind, girl who did genuinely really like me. She saw me as part of her future. I felt the same. I absolutely cherish the time we spent together. However, I felt like anything further down the line without hurting us more. 

Was I right in ending it? 

Also, I'm feeling extremely down about myself - my capability to love. A lot of my peers will have multi-year relationships easily, and seem to make it work. This is basically the closest I've been with someone (at age 24!!), and it was 2 months that ended a little bit painfully."|HarryTerryBarry|False|https://redd.it/ekokiy|85|0.88|0|42|1|relationship_advice

ekyplj|2020-01-06 19:15:33|Am I [M29] in the wrong for asking my girlfriend [F26] to cut off a male friend?|"My girlfriend and I have been together for almost three and a half years, with the past year being long distance. She has had a very close male friend for about six years, who she keeps in regular contact with. I have never had an issue with their friendship or any reason to think that there is more to it. She has always been open about their friendship, and assured me that it is purely platonic.

She told me that they had never dated, slept together, or had anything physical; it has been strictly a friendship. I have met and hung out with him on numerous occasions, and he always seemed like a good friend to her. I have been genuinely happy that she has such a close friend for support. He has always had a girlfriend throughout their friendship and time that she and I have been together, however he recently cheated on his now-ex girlfriend with the woman he is now dating.

It was recently revealed that over the past year or so, this friend has been sending her overtly sexual messages, some of which she responded to in-kind. These messages were all sent while she and I have been together, and while he has been in relationships. He basically drove the conversation into the sexual realm. These messages have been:

\- Him saying that they should take showers together before/after gym sessions  
\- Him explicitly talking to her about sex with other women  
\- Him saying that she should make time to come see him when his girlfriend is out of town  
\- Him telling her that if she spent time at his place, she should only wear certain colors and types of underwear  
\- He and she talking about a mutual friend who got his girlfriend pregnant in which he tells her, ""I hope you don't tell me you're pregnant!""  
\- Him telling her that she should meet him in the middle of the night to have sex; even describing where he would want to have sex (in the woods on the ground, in her car, in a motel); she even responded to this one by saying things like ""The ground would be too hard for that""

Naturally, I panicked when I saw these messages and confronted her about them. Her response was that all of these messages were entirely jokes, and that they were taken out of context. She said that she has never slept with him, had any intention of sleeping with him, and does not think of him sexually despite the sexual nature of these messages. She said that he's just ""that kind of guy"" who talks sexually sometimes, and that she didn't realize that the texts were inappropriate because they were jokes and that she never took them seriously despite her responding in-kind to some of them.

I'm not proud of this, but I then confronted him by sending him screenshots of the messages in question, and accused him of sleeping with my girlfriend. He responded by denying the accusations, chastising me, telling me that I shouldn't be questioning him and her, and that I need to trust her. He then responded to her by telling her that I'm insecure, and that he wished he'd told me: ""I wish I'd told him that we did have sex and that it was amazing!"", instead of just denying the accusations.

After she and I discussed this, she agreed that the messages were inappropriate, and that she would send him a message telling him as much; asking him not to take their conversations to that level again. I am, however, unhappy with how she communicated this, as she basically just apologized for me making such a big deal about their ""jokes"", reiterated that he's a valuable friend to her, and that she wants to keep him in her life. I told her that I felt this wasn't adamant enough, especially considering that he in no way had any remorse or regret for how he spoke to her, continued to chastise me for my actions, and advised her to leave me.

In my mind, not only are the sexual messages inappropriate, but so is his criticism of me, his advising her that she should leave me, and his opinion that their ""jokes"" weren't a big deal and that he had no problem with them. I told her how uncomfortable all of this made me, and basically gave her an ultimatum that she cut this person off entirely or I would be unable to continue a relationship with her. I find it extremely inappropriate that she continues her friendship with someone who doesn't respect her, the boundaries of our relationship, and the boundaries of his own relationship.

Am I in the wrong for feeling this way and giving her the ultimatum?

EDIT: u/uthillygooth suggested I add in context from their question about how these messages were revealed:

That in itself is a big issue, but something I chose not to discuss here. There were a number of incidents where she lied to me, and the only way I found out was after calling her out.

* She lied about where she was after work one day when we had a call scheduled (again, we're long distance). She later revealed that she had gotten a ride home from a male coworker
* She had sent texts to another male friend telling him that she hopes he got home safe from a party, with 😘 and 😉
* She lied about her past with a guy from before she and I met. They had an emotional connection before she and I met, which I didn't care about. However, after she and I started dating, he kept telling her to leave me and go back to her home country to be with him. When I visited her country with her, this person was extremely creepy around her, and I expressed my discomfort. She assured me that there was nothing there. Basically, she had me hang out with a guy who was trying to get her to leave me without telling me.

She showed me the texts between her and all of these people.

**TL:DR -** Found out that my girlfriend's platonic male friend has been sending her increasingly sexual messages. I confronted them both, and they downplayed them all as ""jokes"". She wants to keep someone in her life who disrespects her relationship and her partner."|amiinthewrong0813|False|https://redd.it/ekyplj|5|1.0|0|23|1|relationship_advice
el13az|2020-01-06 21:59:05|Did my bf cross the line? Tells his friends in a group chat how bad he wants other women and celebrities.|"I am a (27F) my (34M) boyfriend of 2 years has been amazing for the most part. Ofcourse we have had our ups and downs but nothing major. We have a child together and I truly believe he is the love of my life . 

I noticed today as I was near him that there was a picture of some girl and I saw him messaging and that it was in that group chat. Well he left his phone on the bed and went into the other room to get our son out of the crib and my curiosity just drove me nuts and I impulsively grabbed his phone and opened the messages. 

I see that he shared a picture of some ig model to the group chat and everyone else was answering to how fine she was. Then he goes on to say that he would love to ""fuck her"" . THEN I see him talking about a bunch of celebrities , talking about Sandra Bullock and how he would eat her ass and how he doesnt even like to eat ass but he totally would to her and talking about he would ""fuck the shit out of Salma hayek"" and drink this other girls dirty bath water, and that he would ""wait in line to fuck so and so ""
 I know it was wrong of me to totally invade his privacy like this so I know I'm in the wrong for that.  But I literally was shaking after reading it all. Now I feel so insecure . I give my all to this man and even fulfill all of his fantasies that hes into , I feel like I could be over reacting but it literally hurt my heart reading that .

He ends up asking me what is wrong because I clearly seemed off and I kept saying everything was fine at first but he kept asking so I finally spilled and told him, "" I did something he was going to be mad at"" (looking through his phone) so he was pretty mad at first that I did that but then he started to understand a little.  But goes on to say ""your not going to make me feel bad for this , they're celebrities!"" .. and saying "" if you had a crush I wouldn't care"" .."" it's not like I like other girls pictures or cheat on you !"" 

So idk I'm kind of looking at him differently as if all of a sudden do I not matter to you? You wouldnt care if I said I wanted to have sex with someone? Alright then ... 

Does anyone here think that he totally crossed a line or went to far by saying those things or am I just overly sensitive? Because I love him so much it hurts to even see him write that!!

Overall, he does treat me well and I do think we have a great relationship over all.  Also tells me on a consistent basis how beautiful I am and how sexy I am so it's not like I'm not getting any attention at all? Idek I'm so caught off guard by this.. 

He has brought up in front of me in the past that he thinks this celebrity is hott and what not . I always brushed it off and never made it a big deal but this ..this kind of hurt to see all of that in detail.

I'm catching feelings for this girl.|"Hello all, my brothers girlfriend (who lives with us) got me a date with her coworker who recently got dumped & ditched at a New Years party by this guy she was with. So 2 days later me & her went to a bar with my best friend, his gf (my cousin), my brother & his gf. Me & the other girl.  So at the end of the night, we had sex.  I guess it was just a rebound thing for her.. I'm not sure.  But anyways, She went home yesterday, because she needed to get her stuff out of her ex's house. 5 hours later that night she asked my brothers gf ""Whats his number?"" so I can only assume she's interested in me, which took me for surprise... Since I didn't know if she was or what not (I was talking about her the whole night, when she left) since she was genuinely a very sweet person.

I'm such a bad texter though..? What do I do? Sometimes it takes me literally 30 minutes to think what to type, since I don't want to say anything dumb since I kinda have attraction for her.

Some of our texts:

Me: So do you plan to work tomorrow or relax? I know you was saying you didn't feel well haha

Her: Working per usual

Me: (Basically telling her a good night text & I'll message her when I'm up tomorrow)

Me: Good morning, I hope your day is treating you well so far

Her: Lol just changing diapers at the moment

Me: Oh my, sounds eventful enough lol.  So do you at least like your job? I don't think I'd be able to handle 13 or so kids at the same time  [😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)"" (took me 40 minutes to reply to this)  I'm a crap texter.

Her: No reply for a hour.

So guys, help me out please. Is my texts weird or..? How do I change this. When it comes to someone I have a crush on, I just naturally feel more confused on what to say, I have no idea why.   Although, she could naturally be busy, I just feel like I'm coming off as super uninteresting, which is messing with me."|adaytoremember111|False|https://redd.it/el12kd|3|1.0|0|8|1|relationship_advice

At first it started off surprisingly well and cute, but then slowly she began her typical thing, twisting and gathering every negative and magnifying it to next level being all dementory telling me everything “wrong” with him every chance she got.  He’s not perfect (no one is) but he’s not the demon she’s making him out to be. 

I’ve told her I hear her and need to make my own choices, to no avail.  And sometimes I just bitterly wish she’d let me enjoy this spot of happiness without throwing a cloud over it, I can see how she got the way she is though, so I have understanding for her.

Anyway that’s an entire other thread - bottom line he thinks my Mom loves him, I feel like I need an award for not breaking up with him for all the misery I’m getting for it - I’m otherwise close to my mom and would be wrecked not to have her in my life and in some sense of course want a change of heart and approval from her. 

 I feel dishonest and conflicted for not telling him, some dates where I’ve picked him up and she’s given me a hard time right before, I’ve started crying about this and every “failure” in my life on the way (because I compound like that) trying to keep it mild so he doesn’t notice it.  I’m also afraid my mom won’t be able to contain herself one day and he’s going to look at me like wtf.  

He’s a bit in his own world, he’s got a strong personality and isn’t entirely always self aware (though he can be very empathetic and always has been supportive to me in the way I needed him to be -  this is one topic I don’t know how to bring up) - I want them to get along and I’m afraid bringing it up will ruin any chance of... I’m at a loss on what best to do.

el0lv2|2020-01-06 21:25:42|How should I (21F) talk to my sister (18F) about how she dresses without shaming or criticizing her own sexuality?|"This is pretty straightforward. This summer I noticed that my youngest sister, who is in her last year of high school, had started to hang out with a new crowd. One of her closest friends had started dating a guy in this group, and soon my sister was hanging out with them as well. I thought a few of these guys and girls were a bit sketchy, but I figured that she would learn that herself after a little while. She clearly wanted to fit in with this group, so a few issues popped up - a bit of trouble with teachers, a couple times she arrived home pretty drunk from parties, and an obvious shift in style that created conflict with my mom - but nothing that I thought caused me concern other than the usual teenage rebellion. She's an adult now and she'll figure it out.

The issue that I have is that she seems to have lost sight of, or not figured out, how to dress for an event. For example, a few times she has gone to job interviews (for basic retail sort of jobs to earn school money) wearing quite revealing tops and super short skirts. She had a meeting at school that was semi-serious and she wore like a tube top, basically. And the one I noticed the most was at Christmas we went to a church service and she wore the sort of thing I'd wear to a club - heels and a halter top minidress.

She's entitled to express her sexuality as she sees fit, but I want her to realize that her fashion choices impact how people perceive her, which is important when trying to get into school, internships, jobs etc. Even a basic internet search would take an employer to her instagram which is all revealing photos/drunk hi-jinks etc.

I know my mom can't really have this conversation because she already unfairly criticizes her outfits all the time. I think I'm the right person to do it, but I'm not sure how to do it without being insulting?"|Cautious_Nectarine|False|https://redd.it/el0lv2|2|0.75|0|8|1|relationship_advice
el0h63|2020-01-06 21:16:50|Am I (31F) undateable to Asian men?|"Hey Reddit! Here's the rundown - I see posts all the time about how asian men have it bad in the dating scene and I am SO.CONFUSED. I am a female who only dates strictly asian races. I don't know why, I don't know how it happened, but that is my preference. It's been great, I have met a lot of really great people and made a lot of really great friends! But that's all it ever ends up being. Friend-zoned. Either I do it to them or they do me.

A little about me (because I have been told by some that this matters), and I'll keep it short. I am 5'7"", caucasian/white, blonde hair, 120 lbs., career where I am making above average income (80k+). I am fairly outgoing and happy in general, and I am an introvert. I like to spend time at home, with my peeps, watching movies or crocheting or playing video games in my free time. Family is important to me. I can logic through problems in a relationship, and actually enjoy compromise as I feel it makes us stronger together. There really haven't been any HUGE arguments in my relationships.

So where does it go wrong? Well, I don't know honestly! But I do have two kids. I have been told by multiple asian men that having kids makes me less desireable or worth less. A guy I dated for two years hid the fact that I had kids from his parents because he was ashamed of it. He didn't meet my kids himself until a year into the relationship when I felt we were all of us ready, but he knew they existed. Anyways, I thought that maybe some Asian guys would be able to look past this, but that hasn't been my experience. I'm not one of those to push my kids on a new person. I don't want to do that to my kids, so I don't know if this is it or not honestly. Just telling them I have kids seems to kill the mood for them.

One guy I dated before I was making as much as I do now, and he told me I wasn't successful enough for him and he was ashamed I was only making 50k/year. We broke up. :| I'm friends with all my exes, I've hung out with each of them occasionally as I enjoy their company, but I couldn't see it going farther than just friends after the things they've said to me.

I'm at a point in my life where I really want to connect with someone on a higher level, find someone to challenge me and push me to be a better me. Someone who is successful, funny, and intelligent. Outside of online dating, I have no idea how to even meet Asian men, either. Online dating has not been working. At. All. I get a lot of weird crap, hate posts of my prefs, etc.

Side note - It's not a secret that I date exclusively Asian men. I don't know why this is such a huge deal to some people, but I just do not find any other race attractive to me. Surprisingly, some people get pissed at me that I am not attracted to white males. So please if you're taking offense to this post, it's not meant for that. I just want to find love. And I don't care what people say, I have to be physically attracted to the person I'm with - I'm very sexually needy. Also no, I am not a weeb (I think this is the right word...). I like Asian culture, but it does not consume my life.

So Reddit, I ask you - am I undateable to an Asian man? Where does one find a partner if you're not a part of their culture? Should I set up shop at the local pho joint and take my lunches there every day, bet on dat luck?? Or should I just go back to white men (no thanks, I'll stay single).."|ThrowRA_29309|False|https://redd.it/el0h63|4|0.8|0|19|1|relationship_advice
el0fsz|2020-01-06 21:14:16|Girlfriend (F32) and I (M34) challenges when going out|" 

I am having some confusing issues with my girlfriend that are causing me a lot of stress and leading me to question myself. I'd love a female perspective.

She is a great, smart, normally thoughtful, talented, and generally good person and I'm not knocking on her here.

However, when it comes to social situations, this relationship is difficult for me. I preface this post by describing myself, in the most modest way possible, as a good looking, confident, kind, and outgoing guy. My attachment style is secure. I have been in several relationships and never felt insecure before. I like to think I am socially aware and can fit in in many crowds. I have learned that an outgoing person I need to keep my partner in mind when we are out as I have made some people feel neglected in my past. I try to be better about that now.

But this is the most socially challenging situation I've ever faced.

When I socialize with my girlfriend, i feel she is looking for attention from strangers. Secondly, she gets drunk and her behavior is unpredictable. She is 32. She has amazing fashion sense (I love this about her). She's very pretty. She has a outgoing personality. She has done some botox and lip injections,  it looks natural and gives her a pretty stunning look. But I think she uses this to attract attention from strangers (She says ""just gay guys and women"") who give her compliments when we are at bars, concerts, and parties. She is, almost always, quite drunk in these situations and sometimes does party drugs, too. The issue is, sometimes she goes and talks to these strangers, even dances with them, and i'm sort of left nursing a drink. You'll ask, well go join her, but I think if you saw you'd see how that would be awkward - she is very animated and engaged with these conversations and seems to prefer coming back over to me and relaying the compliments she gets. I notice sometimes that she seems to distance herself a few feet from me an then starts looking around the room for eye contact or someone to talk to her. It makes me feel like, well....not good. I have spent a good 20 minutes just twiddling my thumbs when we are out while this behavior unfolds.

The second thing that happens is she gets flat out mean. She will criticize something about me that she is fixated on, and then when she is sober the next day, it is revealed that she is not really upset about these issues at all. But I'm generally more sober and I remember all the mean things that were said, and it's hard to write it off to drunk frustration. I'm starting to feel resentful which is not fair to either of us.

I understand. Attention feels good. Compliments, too. I understand that alcohol makes it easier to bring up issues. But it's starting to affect my life as I am both resentful of this and anxious of when it will happen again.

Any advice or insight is very appreciated. Feeling a little too old for this."|heyramona|False|https://redd.it/el0fsz|3|1.0|0|17|1|relationship_advice

Their relationship has seemed fine from a distance, I have never heard them yell or noticed them being angry with each other.

But last week my brother felt something was off with his wife, so he asked her about it.

And that’s when she dropped a bomb, she told him she wasn’t sure if she loves him anymore.

He didn’t see it coming, in fact no one saw it coming.

They haven’t told the kids about it yet, and they have since then decided to go to a marriage councillor.


My brother has taken this very hard and is crying when we talk about it. 
And I honestly feel very angry about this and want to tell her how much I hate this situation.

I just feel that I’m angry she didn’t first go to a curator or similar to talk about how she is feeling - to see if the reason she is feeling this way is because she herself might going through a mid life crisis or similar. But then she instead took it out on my brother and “blamed” him and their marriage.

I’m sorry, I need help! 

I hate seeing my brother this sad! And I don’t know what I can do! Is there anything I can do? And am I wrong in being angry with her?

ekzw6a|2020-01-06 20:36:47|ThrowRA My boyfriend (27M) broke up with me (27F) over a test.|"I posted this in r/relationships, but it was removed for asking if anyone had been in a similar situation.


We’d been dating since October, and official since the beginning of December. So, a very short relationship but I was enjoying spending time with him and excited to do things together in the future. He always seemed to be, too.

He broke up with me because he needs to study for a test that’s really important for securing a career and his future. He basically said he feels he can’t be a good boyfriend and pass the test simultaneously. He said he could continue to spend time with me and likely fail the test, or neglect me and try to pass. So instead of being unresponsive and too busy to meet, he thought it was fairer to me to just break things off. And I don’t disagree, to be honest. I get how much pressure he’s under and I’m not mad at him but I am sad because I was really starting to like him.

The test is over in 2 months and he told me he can’t make any promises, or call it a break, because he doesn’t know what will happen in 2 months. But he also said that if I reach out in 2 months he would be happy (he doesn’t want me to message him at all in this time because he says it would be distracting) He said he feels like its a bit of a dick move to reach out to me once he’s done and I do see how it could be.

I fully intend to respect his wishes and not contact him because I would hate to be any sort of distraction to him (he unfollowed me on instagram and removed me from following him even) because the test is really, really serious in our country. Its extremely competitive and people study for years and sometimes still fail. And there’s a part of me that wonders what would happen if he does fail this time. I think he won’t want to get back together and will just study for a year. It would also be a lie if I didn’t say a part of me is worried he’s just making an excuse up, but I told him multiple times during the conversation I would rather be told that than have someone lie to soften the blow.

I suppose I’m just looking to see if anyone has been in a similar situation? Or any advice on how to deal with this? I know my best option is to just work on moving on, but I know a part of myself is gonna be counting the days and hoping we can try again. Even if its a small part. And that small part will be very sad if it doesn’t work out.

My boyfriend of 6 years knows this. I confided in him and in the past 2 months he has seen me through my lowest moments due to my drinking habits.

el1ncn|2020-01-06 22:37:45|How can I [20M] fix my relationship or is it too far gone|"Sorry for the formatting since I’m typing this on my phone. And this is going to be a long one sorry about that. 

[Background] My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over 2 years now and it has been a wonderful relationship until about 2 months ago. Up until then we seemed like a perfect Match and only ever argued over little things but it never lasted long and we made up fairly quickly. We have an amazing sex life, at the start of the relationship we would have sex at least once a day up. Now our sex drive ahas slowed down a bit but we both enjoy it and we have sex at least twice a week. She has always been sensitive which is a reasoning to why we would argue most of the time, she usually took something the wrong way or got her feelings hurt if I said something in a mean tone of voice. She has never been liked talking things out when we have problems. She always just gets upset and wants me to leave her alone so it’s hard to talk to her 

[Problem] about a month or two ago we found out she was pregnant and we were both as happy as can be. I was extremely happy but my girlfriend said I didn’t look too happy (I am the type of person that always has a straight face and can’t really tell what I’m feeling or thinking) but I assured her I was. Ever since she has been getting angry at me every chance she gets and has even started resulting to telling me to “shut the fuck up” and slapping me. The slapping started as something playful and extremely soft and slow and was usually on my chest or on my arm considering I’m well built and go to the gym frequently but it has progressed to the point where it hurts my arm or even slapped me in the face once or twice (I’ll have to hold her arms against the bed because she will continue slapping my arm or trying to kick me or pinch). 

Last week she told me she was tired of being with me and wanted to break up. I was absolutely heart broken because I love this girl and want her in my future. I asked for a reasoning as I was trying to hold back tears and she just said that she’s tired of me being mean. I told her I’d try to be even more nice than I already am to her and to please just let me try to fix things. The was that I really didn’t know what I was doing wrong. She likes to spend money and I have been advising her recently to spend it more wisely considering we have a child on the way, she said I was a dick and I shouldn’t be telling her what to do and that I piss her off. She has also been reconnecting with her mom recently and spends all her time with her, which I’m happy for her because that’s her mom. I don’t care for her mom much because in the past she’s said some iffy things about me and Id rather not talk to her if I don’t need to but I’m always respectful. 2 days ago she spent the night at her moms and wanted me to pick her up in the morning, I told her I was fine with that and she told me around 11AM, 11 rolls around and she tells me to hold on because she’s making food and wants to eat so I accept and wait. She continues give me reasons to extend the like she’s going to the store or her mom wants her to go somewhere and I end up waiting till 9pm. At this point I was mad because I had pretty much wasted away the day waiting but I let it slide and not mention it but when I picked her up I did have a sort of an attitude. 

We get home and she sleeps and I stay up watching Netflix. My phone was updating so I grab her phone to play my Mobil games and as soon as I open her phone it’s on Snapchat and one of the stories is from an ex boyfriend of hers. She has told me she blocked all her exes and I was visibly confused on why he was there. Their last text was 38 weeks ago so I was hoping it was nothing but I open the chat out of curiosity and it’s just paragraphs from her saying that she loved him and they were inseparable, that she wants to see him try harder if they want to be together and how much he hurt her etc... I was extremely hurt not only because she lied to me but because it seemed like she was cheating. These text we sent almost a week before my birthday and when we got together she told me she’d tell me whenever a guy texted her. This wasn’t a rule or anything I put up she said she wanted to do this for me to she me I could always trust her because she’s knows I have a problem with trust issues. 

I questioned her about it and she instantly got mad at me telling me she was “fucking over the relationship” and that I was an asshole. I asked her why she even text him and her response was that he texted her first and he was blowing up her phone so she just wanted to get him to stop texting her. I knew this was a lie because they texted for a few days after that but that’s the story she has stuck with. She told me straight up that she’s fallen out of love with me and doesn’t want to be with me anymore. At this point I was crying but I choked it down and said if she wanted to leave I’d be okay with that but I’d always be there for her and my child. We didn’t talk for a bit after that but later on the day I was making food and she came into the kitchen, I offered to cook her something and she accepted. She was visibly calm and wanted me to hold her. We went to my room and had angry breakup sex but instead it turned into makeup sex and she was happy with me again telling me she loved me.

el1lmv|2020-01-06 22:34:31|Worried about my (29f) friend (28f) - how should I approach? Sorry, long.|"So I have this friend, we will call her Jane. I have known her for around 6-7 years. Admittedly, we used to be a lot closer than we are now, but the context of our friendship seems to be weird now. Some background of our friendship/life - I met her when I dated her brother, but we didn't become good friends until after he and I broke up. I thought she was single when I met her, and she acted single when we would go out. Come to find out, she had a boyfriend the whole time (they started dating while I was dating her bro). Jane and her boyfriend (call him Joe) hid their relationship because he was going through a divorce (separated long before they met), and because he's quite a bit older than her (he is 49). 

I found out about Joe maybe a year into our friendship, when my husband and I met. We all 4 went out some, double dates or going out to see a band. My husband and Joe get along, but they arent best buds or anything. At one point, I can honestly say that she was my best friend (for a good 2 years), then it got to where Jane only called me when she needed to vent about Joe. She would call me and complain about him, about the same three problems - his drinking, the fact that he hadn't proposed and him being wishy washy about if he would have a child with her (this is where the age difference comes into play - he has a 25 yo son). 

We hung out more over the summer, just her and I. It was almost like she was using time away from him with me to test the waters and see what single life would be like. Chatting with other guys, talking about her exit plan to leave him, etc. I've told her all along that I will support her decision regarding him regardless of whatever she decides, but have given her my honest opinions on his patterns of behavior (changing for a week, then going back to his constant drinking - going back to not wanting a baby), and have told her that he honestly probably doesn't want a baby given his past comments and his age. 

They broke up at the end of the summer for like 2 days, then got back together. She stayed at my house the night they split, and I was there for her a lot during that time. Ever since then she has been weird. She will text me and the conversations are always something like this:  
Jane: Hey  
Me: Hey girl, what's up?  
Jane: How are you?  
Me: I'm good, how are you doing?  
Jane: Good  
Me: That's good. What do you have going on this weekend? Want to get together soon?  
Jane: Yes  
Me: Let me know when you're free  
Then nothing. Then the next day or 2 days later, she texts again starting from the beginning, then the conversation ends after small talk of hey how are ya. IT's almost always her initiating the conversation, then her stopping responding. (Though I do initiate sometimes and try to make plans or what not)

A couple of times, she has mentioned getting lunch or grabbing drinks, and says lets do something on X date, but then stops responding on the day, or tries to make plans last minute then says lets rain check. 

It's just weird to me that she keeps initiating conversation, but it never goes anywhere. I don't know whether to stop responding to her, or to try harder to spend some time with her. I'm worried about her.

Also, I will add that this fall, her and Joe got engaged. I met her for dinner a few days after the proposal, and she was weird. She was not excited at all. She told me they were already thinking about wedding plans, but were disagreeing on everything. She did not seem thrilled in his choice of rings (and she is the farthest from a material girl - she is a firefighter/tomboy for context).  She mentioned that she told him the night of their engagement that they will have prenups (which he probably wanted anyways after the awful divorce he went through). She was telling me that she wants a prenup so that it's not ""permanent"" if something were to change. It was just weird, and not like her. She's always been a really caring girl, and she just seems... off.

Que to last night - the reason I'm writing this post. I got a call from Joe, which seemed weird. A couple times since they have been together, Joe has planned a surprise party for Jane's birthday, so I assumed he was maybe doing something again (her birthday is this month). When I answered, he was in panic. He had been out of town all weekend, and he hadn't heard from her in several hours, and she was nowhere to be found. He asked if I had heard from her, and I said no that I hadn't talked to her since the day prior. He said she had told him she was meeting a friend named Casey for drinks at a winery. He doesn't know Casey's number, and asked one of Casey's friends, who called Casey, and Casey said she was grocery shopping, not with Jane. She was ignoring his calls, and he was genuinely worried (probably worried that she had driven drunk). 

I called her, and she ignored my call after a couple rings, then I got an auto response text, which confirmed that she actually ignored the call. I text her asking what she was up to. She responded Hi a few hours later. By this time, Joe had already called me and said he spoke to her and she was ok, but that she was ignoring his calls and being short with him. I wasn't sure whether I should tell her that Joe reached out to me. Should I? I asked her if everything was ok today, and she responded Yep. 

I don't know what to do with this friendship. I'm worried about her - she has not been herself. But I can't seem to get past the small talk with her, and making plans falls through every time I try. How can I help my friend? Or do I just give up on the friendship all together?

TL;DR - friend has been weird. Went from best friends, to someone who only wanted to vent about her BF, to only texts me with small talk, but text me every few days, not just once in awhile. I am worried about her, as she is acting out of character. I'm confused about what to do."|mskon32|False|https://redd.it/el1lmv|2|1.0|0|0|1|relationship_advice

el1i0p|2020-01-06 22:27:24|Dealing with the loss of a loved one due to alcohol and drugs|"Hey everyone.

I've (25f) struggled with alcoholism for the past 3 years, and within the past almost 6 months found myself going through rehab. I've gotten out in the past 2 months, and been sober for 2 months except for 1 night of drinking shortly after I got out. 

A week after getting checked into rehab, someone else came in named S (40sM), and we instantly connected. He had been into rehab once before, and from the start we helped and supported each other. He was like my protector, goofy older brother, whom I could talk to about anything. Im sure others who have been through an in-patient rehab know the ""unusual friendship pairings"" I am talking about. We would have probably never talked/been such close friends had we not met in such an environment, but we did, and I don't believe I would have been able to have had the confidence or courage to be moving forward the way I am today had it not met him. We would go on an hour walk most everyday in the 2 hours we had between the days groups, and the nighttime dinner/meetings were we talked about everything we were going through. He had me laugh, and believed in me in a time when most of my other loved ones were at the end of their ropes. I loved him, and needed him, and knew the rest of my life he would be someone I could talk to and rely on whenever I needed him. And I would be that for him. I talk some time before I let people into my life in such a way, and he became part of my inner circle. 

We got out of rehab, and went into the same sober living community. Starting around Thanksgiving he started slowly drinking and using again. On Christmas day, he called me wanting to talk about it all, and talking about suicide(something he had longtime struggled with). He'd been drinking though, and was driving, and on the phone with him he got into a car accident, and started raging. He was okay, but after that I told him he had to start getting being true to himself/the program/whatever and until then, I had to put some distance because I couldn't support him while he was drinking. I loved him, would always be there, but he had to start going back to meetings, and stop drinking.

He went to a psych ward, got out, and when he called me said he understood, and wanted to get better. We talked 3 times the week after christmas and on New Years eve. I suspected he may be drinking, but it wasn't so ""bad"" that I called him out, and I was keeping it short anyway because of my suspicions. 

Well yesterday I learned that he was found dead in a hotel room. There was alcohol in the room, and pill bottles. No one really knows what happened. I had been ""preparing"" myself for this the past week after christmas day, but nothing could really prepare me for what is has been like. I have never experienced grief before, and having the added element of substance abuse makes things even harder. My family, and friends have been trying to be supportive, but its ""well he was very sick, this was going to happen"", ""there was nothing you can do"", ""you need to move on like he would have wanted you to"" ect. and thats all fine, but its been just about 24 hours, and I am just sad right now. I was with my other buddies from the rehab last night for dinner/a sleepover to be together and that was great. People that knew the funny, complicated person he was as I knew him. 

But I feel like I'm on a carousel of feelings, and I can't not think about him, and all the things leading up to his death, and our friendship. But most of my loved ones didn't know him, and don't get it. It's like I am expected to be ""fine"" and functioning, but there are points during the day when I just want to lay down in my bed, or go outside and listen to music or just cry and think about him. Already I am feeling judged for my parents, and its like the person I would want to above everyone else is him, and I am just tired. I feel battered. 

&#x200B;

I guess now I am just asking for advice for how I should be feeling or acting right now, or even comment stories.

We've Worked on seeing each other even with our hectic work schedules. Now ever since new years day (random point of time) has happened ive been getting ignored here and there through text. Ive made plans to meet up with her and she recently stood me up on a lunch date ruining a saturday for me by staying home all day waiting for her to reply to confirm a time. She didnt text me a sorry or reply to my texts till later that night like nothing happened. 

So im generally confused due the lack of communication as its getting worse. I would admit if i did something really wrong but i honestly have done nothing. So my question is how should I appoint her over  whats been happening? How do i confront her about the issue without coming off too heavy or strong? Should I try to make plans again and confront her?

Im pretty calm about whats going on, it just hurts keeping whats in bothering me. There might be something going on in her personal life that might be more important.

So Sunday night I 23M asked this girl 22F from my class if she’d like to study together for a test we have today. She said yeah and I got her number etc. I texted her and set up a time for yesterday evening at 7:30. 
We met at school at 7:30p and studied and talked a lot of course and I really felt like it was going well and we both had good exchanges and some chemistry etc. I figured as good as it seemed to be going, there was no way she would say no, as I felt like she was enjoying her self too. We got done at 11:15p and I told her on the way out, thanks for meeting, it was helpful blah blah and then said I’d like to get to know her better outside of school... when I said this, there was a little chuckle and like a pause for a second or two and she said, well, there’s church, xxxxx, xxxxx, xxxxx basically naming places outside of school. I guess I was expecting a yes or no, so this kind of has me confused if she’s down or if she isn’t down. I was going to text her after the test tmrw and say again, ‘The test went well thanks again for studying... look forward to doing church after break.’ FYI, we go to a christian university, so naturally we attend church, just not together obviously at this point.

I texted her this afternoon and told her the test went well and told her about a few of the chapters our professor put emphasis on. She replies with ‘Sweet!’ 

I then text her again and said ‘Good Luck!’ ‘Will shoot you a text after break and we’ll get together for church’

Her reply was, ‘Thanks!’ ‘Okay sounds good’ ‘Have a merry Christmas!’ 

And I said Same to you!!

How would y’all interpret her response? Would someone that wasn’t interested agree to study one on one and then talk about themselves and stuff if they weren’t interested and suggest a new place to go study after the building we were in closed for the night?

He's very understanding and says we'll get through this, whether as a couple or not. I just feel so heartbroken losing the person I trust the most but we can't go on like this. We kind of have a date where we'll need to break up because of our different wishes for the future and he says he wants to hold on to our relationship until that day comes but I don't know if I can do that.

Telling me sweet things like he likes me and he could do this every day. After just coming out of a 4 year relationship in August 2019, I told myself that I would not date for 2 years or until after I sought a counselor to help me cope with that breakup. Just a couple days ago I had a talk with my FWB and explained to him that I think we started things off wrong and I want to hold off on any more sex. He said he understood and asked me on a date. Just recently I have felt that he has been pulling away, for example, taking longer to respond to my texts and being short with his responses in text. I am taking these as a red flag because he was not previously like that in text. Should I consider ending our FWB? Reason is because I am starting to catch feelings but it has only been about a week and I am already feeling jealousy and sadness when he is MIA, and extreme happiness when I hear from him.

We love each other very much, have plans to move in to our own house together in the next few months and have spoken about marriage. Like i said, it’s going wonderful. However, we don’t have as much sex as we used to, which I thought was due to me being on my period quite often and him being tired from very physical work. As the title suggests, I’m interested in being in an “exclusive” and committed relationship, but he is poly. He doesn’t want relationships with other women, only sex, but it makes me very uncomfortable. However, he’s the man I see myself being with when I imagine my future, and I genuinely want some advice on how to become more comfortable with casual sex outside of our relationship without feeling jealous or as if it’s a form of cheating. Has anyone been through something similar or can offer advice ? I can’t think of what to do and I love him with my whole heart

I thought it would be worth mentioning that this discussion came after a conversation talking about our recent lack of sex, where he mentioned the above points (my menstruation and his fatigue). It was immediately after that he said he needs to sleep with other women, so this is very sudden and difficult to process. I’m also living 2 hours away from him for the next month (will see him for 1 day in 2 weeks) so I’m unsure how to process this information, and whether I wait for a chance to speak in person (even though it’s such a huge thing for me that it’s affecting my job and mental/physical health), or call him now and risk having an argument instead of a discussion, but realising where I sit in all of this.

Another point worth mentioning may be that we text a lot, and the last time I lived away I was doing something and couldn’t text for an hour. I didn’t tell him this and he said he was worried, it was unusual and that he was concerned I was sleeping with other guys.

He’s also said the only thing I could do wrong was cheat on him.

Everyone is very nice, so it offered a circle of friends that I could be a part of since my divorce just over a year ago. 

Just before New Years I connected with one of the guys on the team through Facebook. He has always been very nice, offering tips to be a better player and whatnot. Since we connected on Facebook we have talked daily about anything and everything. I really like him - he is smart, funny, attractive --- the problem is I will be 40 in less than a week. And he is 29. 

I have not really dated - or even talked to a man other than my former husband in 17+ years. But I have no idea how to tell if he is just being really nice to the old lady, or if he likes me. He has sent me a few pictures through messenger (nothing sexual in at way) and messages me daily, even if I don't contact him first.

I’ve been learning what is and isn’t healthy since that relationship ended, and now I’m with this new guy (about 6 months) and I’m worried I’m accidentally mimicking bad behavior from my last relationship. 

Sometimes my boyfriend will decline sex, for whatever reason. Sick, depression spell, tired, just not in the mood, etc. It’s not every time, but it’s been happening more and more lately. I always get very disappointed (I know he has depression, so I understand why he declines during hard days/weeks) and I try not to make it obvious. Like if he says “I’m tired, I want to go to bed” I’ll stop trying to initiate and encourage him to sleep. But recently he told me it’s actually REALLY obvious when I’m disappointed and he feels guilty when he sees me upset. I’m not doing it on purpose but I really don’t want to guilt him into sex. I don’t want to be like that. 

Now it’s this guilt cycle of me feeling guilty for making HIM feel guilty and I just want it to be chill and not a big deal :( Like yeah, I’m more and more disappointed as it gets longer without sex, but it’s not like I want to make him feel bad because of it! I get insecure when we don’t have sex for a while, but thats something I need to work on within myself. I don’t want to make him feel bad because of my own issues.

She texted me last night letting me know she cut herself again and i don’t know what to do. I asked her what i can do to help but she hasn’t responded because she was most likely up drinking late. 

Everyone I’ve talked to is telling me to talk to her dad. He’s the only parental figure in her life and she truly loves and trusts him but he seems out of touch with the situation. She attempted to commit suicide in a hotel over the summer and was stopped by police and admitted to a mental hospital. The police called me and i called her dad. She hated me for a few days because i told her dad but i didn’t know what else to do because she lives with him and she had her dog in the hotel with her so i needed to let him know. 

This brings me to my point of concern, how to i tell her dad without her hating me again? I’m her only close friend and i don’t want her to feel alone and like she can’t trust me anymore but i think she needs help beyond what i can provide. 

I’ve talked to her about therapy because i go too but she told me she has a hard time opening up. Her dad is a great man but he seems out of touch to all of this. She gets super drunk when he leaves the house and hides drinking behind his back. She has started being sneaky with me too about her alcohol consumption. I know she needs help but how do i go about it without damaging our friendship and making her feel alone? 

Her dad recently got remarried and her step mom hates her. The marriage is rocky right now because of her and them getting out of the honeymoon phase so her dad is very busy. Her stepmom had been out of town for a few weeks and the first day with her back was the day she relapsed.

My sister you could say reacted in a negative manner.

He didn’t graduate high school, and it shows through his lack of communication and vocabulary skills. He has poor grammar and it’s evident when he speaks.

Today he went to go fill out applications, and he walked out of the house in basketball shorts and a t shirt. He didn’t understand why I was so shocked at his choice of clothing, and even when I explained why, he refused to go change because he was already running late.

She is quite “ocd” when it comes to cleaning and cooking which I never thought would be a problem, except she’s usually doing it until 10 pm, sometimes until midnight or later. While I appreciate the cooking and cleaning, it’s overkill of what I need to be happy. I’d rather her spend 2 hours with me watching a movie or going on a date than for her to race around the house cleaning whatever she can or making consistent gourmet meals. I want dedicated time with her focused on me. 

I work 60 hours a week and do quite a bit of house maintenance and chores as well. I would consider myself hard working, and far from lazy. However, spending time to unwind at the end of the night is almost always a must for me, even if that’s half an hour. I can’t get my girlfriend to do so with me, because she always seems to have a chore she needs to do to feed her OCD. We hardly have sex (twice a month on average) because I’m passed out before she even stops cleaning and have opposite work schedules. 

I do want to say, when I’m exhausted I’m simply not the nicest. I’ve lashed out more than my fair share of times from just being so tired with how much she asked me to do on an already 10 hour day. Again; I do as much as I can to help until it’s simply too much and I’m not saying it’s ever ok to lash out, but it’s certainly taking a toll on our relationship. She thinks I’m quite immature for the lash outs, which may be true, I don’t know.

el0zwz|2020-01-06 21:52:19|Living with my brother|"I recently moved out several states away with my brother for college. We have been friends for several years now so being roommates sounded like a great idea. He is driving me crazy. Our house is a hellhole because it’s so dirty. He refuses to pick up after himself and throws a fit every time I ask him to do the dishes (I have done the last countless amount of loads). He’s the older brother yet it feels like I have to do anything that has to do with adulting. He’s a chill guy to hang out with but any time I mention the fact that he owes me about 2k, or that it’s his turn to do the dishes, or that maybe smoking random joints of our shared weed isn’t the best (we just lost our weed guy after getting severely shorted), he makes it so that I’m the asshole. I don’t know what to do anymore. I would move but it’s very difficult to find a place around here to accommodate for my big dog (who tends to get barkey at other people in the house). Living with him in these conditions is affecting my mental health. It’s really difficult for me to confront people especially when they react like this. I feel trapped. I just want to find someone to take over my lease so I can live in a hippy van and travel across the country.

Sorry this was more of a rant. Needed to get things off my chest. He did text me saying he’s sorry but it’s just hard to forgive because it’s become a chronic thing"|womp-the-womper|False|https://redd.it/el0zwz|2|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice

Anyway we were just talking and I brought up that I’m a virgin because well it was related to what we were talking about and he said “I bet your pussy is really tight then”. I just said idk and laughed because I felt awkward. We haven’t mentioned it since but I can’t stop thinking about it.

ekxmqs|2020-01-06 17:58:57|Should I feel bad if my girlfriend forgot when my birthday was, but remembered my sisters?|"We’ve been dating since October. I’m M 30, she’s also 30.

She’s met my family a few times, we’ve talked about birthdays and stuff a few times here and there. I told her when mine was early on when we started dating.

The other day, she was talking about adding important dates/birthdays to her calendar, and she was like “when is your sisters? March 23?” And I was like “yeah, that’s right.”

Then I was like “do you have my birthday in your calendar?” She goes “hold on let me check... when is your birthday? July 11?” I’m like “no...” so she was trying to think/guess when it was, when she pulled it up she goes “I have it marked on here as July 21, but I have a feeling it’s actually July 22... is that correct?” And then I told her that July 22 is correct.

Then she goes to add my other sisters birthday, and goes “when is hers again? December 3?” And I told her yep that’s correct.

So then I was like “whoa you remembered both my sisters birthdays but not mine lol?”

She explained that she’s bad at remembering dates, so once she added mine in her calendar, there was no need to try and remember it anymore... whereas with my sisters birthdays, she says that she hadn’t added them in there yet, so she had to try extra hard to remember them until she did put them in her calendar.

How would you feel if this scenario happened to you? Would your feelings be hurt if your significant other forgot your birthday or would you think it’s no big deal?"|TA12419|False|https://redd.it/ekxmqs|5|0.86|0|10|1|relationship_advice
el0uf5|2020-01-06 21:42:05|my (21F) boyfriend (32M) is constantly talking to his ex|"Have been with my boyfriend a few weeks.

I found out that he is still in touch with his ex. They broke up 2 months before we got together, and he admitted he slept with her before Christmas, when we were dating. 

He has stayed in touch with her ever since. He texts her asking her opinions on different things - and they send ESSAYS to each other. And I mean ESSAYS. Literally about 30 separate paragraphs over Whatsapp in one go. They're talking about books, politics, philosophy .... 

They reply to each other within like 2 days, and my boyfriend says ""Will reply to you as soon as possible!!"" and ""sorry it took so long to get back to you, things have been hectic"" (no shit, there was 30 paragraphs to reply to - must of taken hours to fucking respond) 

He still calls her a pet name he gave her (kinda like fairy) - ""merry christmas fairy!"" and ""happy new year fairy!"" 

\- always saying things like ""I'll have to explain this to you in person!"" and ""you're the only person I know who would ask such an interesting question!!""  and ""can't wait to debate this with you"" 

Last message I read she asked when they can meet up to ""get his stuff back to him and kick his ass in a debate"" 

Could it be that they are just friends now  - seems unlikely because they slept together a few weeks ago. 

&#x200B;

Why is he carrying on a text conversation with her- is he being polite, or would he just not respond if he didn't want to? 

Am I right to be upset, or do exes stay in touch like this?"|LowFox9|False|https://redd.it/el0uf5|2|1.0|0|20|1|relationship_advice
el0ts5|2020-01-06 21:40:53|Got sober, and realized that one of my (20F) best friends (21F) is a shitty person.|"So I wasn’t an addict per say, but I smoked weed consistently every day with my friend, who we’ll call Alex. I guess I just wasn’t really seeing things too clearly during this time, I thought she was really cool and fun to be around. My mom always said she didn’t like Alex’s ‘attitude problem’ and my other friends never liked her, but I just thought that they didn’t spend as much time with her as I did so they just didn’t know her as well as I do. 

It’s safe to say that maybe I just wasn’t in a great place either at the height of our friendship- partying, leaving school in the middle of the day, going through so many relationships.  My other friends were all older and graduated before me before going off to college, so I only really hungout with Alex every day. Literally every day. 

Anyways, I’m in a really good place now, busy with college and work but I do hangout with my other friends super often now.

Well I had some heart problems (genetic) and can’t smoke anymore, so I stopped completely after smoking everyday for over a year. I don’t drink as much or party either. And my head’s just so much more clear about a lot of things, and unfortunately Alex is one of them.

So she recently had a baby daughter with her boyfriend, couple months old. 

I was with her and her daughter a couple weeks ago shopping, and some old couple walked by and complimented her daughter in her carrier just saying, “oh, she is the absolute cutest. Look at those cheeks!” And Alex just scoffed, said ‘yeah, I know’ in a really rude tone, and walked away. Then she mutters, “creepy fucks. Mind your own business.” I was just like “...” not gonna say anything. Maybe she’s just in a bad mood or something. 

Then the other day we’re shopping and the cashier asks her a simple question like, “do you want to pay 10 cents for a bag?” And Alex was like, “no, I brought one with me.” No problem, the cashier just didn’t see her bag. Well we walk outside after paying and she just goes off like, “what a fucking stupid bitch. Obviously I don’t need to pay for a bag, is she stupid? Literally had it right in front of her. *do you want to pay 10 cents for a bag?* fuck off lady.”  I didn’t even say anything because I was just thinking ‘what the holy hell is up this girl’s ass right now?’

Then I was with her and her boyfriend, and like they seem to be happy but their relationship is sooooo fucking volatile. I’d never met him before because she moved away for a few months after highschool when she met him, and he’d always been working whenever I was with her. But damn, this was a terrible first impression. She was just openly mocking him and laughing when he’d get annoyed, he’d start calling her awful things like a ‘Cunt’ and she’d just laugh about it and be like, ‘that’s right, and you love me. So what’s that make you? Loser.’ Then they’d just kiss and hold hands as if they weren’t just crazy disrespectful to each other. 

Jesus Christ, so awkward being near that. 

She told me she’s antivax too now.

She lives with her grandpa and just constantly complains about him even though he’s completely supports her financially and bought her a brand new car. And speaking of cars, she threw an empty fast food bag out of hers while we were driving. 

She’s just constantly complaining, she never has a positive thing to say about anything. 

There’s been so many other things, but now I’m like ‘Jesus Christ. This is my best friend. How the hell is this my best friend, I didn’t see how terrible she was? This is crazy.” 
She hasn’t smoked since being pregnant and isn’t right now with breastfeeding, so like maybe she’s just bitchy without weed? Idk, I feel like that’s not a good justification.

So like, yeah. What should I do? I’m her only friend other than her boyfriend. She’s nice and awesome to me but like I can’t stand how she treats other people and how pessimistic she is."|mrose9999|False|https://redd.it/el0ts5|2|1.0|0|3|1|relationship_advice
el0swn|2020-01-06 21:39:09|Should I still go on a first date or just cancel?|"So I’ve (16F) been friends with this guy(16M) for a long tome and we’ve been getting closer over the past 2-3 months or so. About a month ago the guy asked me out and I said yes. I really liked him as a friend and thought maybe. As soon as I turned around I realised that I didn’t. He texted me saying he was really nervous because it was his first date and I honestly didn’t know what to say to that because I was going to cancel. We had been talking every day so after I didn’t text him for a while school became really awkward. He then asked if him asking me out had made it awkward and as I know he has struggled with self esteem I said no thinking it would make it better. In this conversation I basically said yes I was still up for a date as now I was going to just end it after that.

I started to realise I liked him even less as I realised he  called me a bitch all the time which before hadn’t bothered me but it got to the point that whenever he said that word I thought he was talking to me. In addition to this he can be really negative and it started to make me feel worse. I still hadn’t told my friends at this point so about two weeks after this happened I eventually told them and they said he had been a lot happier since I had said yes to a date with him and acting less like a dick overall. I recently saw another friend and she said that he had said to someone else that if I never bring it up then it just won’t happen. Soon after he asked if I wanted to hang out and I said as soon as I have a better idea of my schedule during this term.

I don’t know if it seems stupid but I want to keep a friendship with him and don’t know how to carry on now to make it not awkward. We basically never text anymore but I feel like maybe it’s my fault for making it awkward because I said yes and I tend to flirt with guys when I talk to them. I don’t know whether or not I should actually go on a date with him because of this  but I think not bringing up anything at all will destroy all the relationship with him in any capacity. I also don’t want to lower his self esteem any more.

el0l2h|2020-01-06 21:24:11|My brother [23m] told a messed up lie about his girlfriend [25f]|"My brother has complained about his girlfriend ""Amanda"" before, and I usually agree with him that Amanda's behavior is shitty. But he just told me something about Amanda that I know to be a lie, and I don't know what to do now.

I went to Amanda's birthday party for just a short while, so my brother probably forgot I had been there at all. I was there when two of Amanda's good friends stopped by with their young son ""Joseph"". Amanda is an honorary aunt to Joseph, and they obviously really love each other. Like little kids do, Joseph immediately ran to Amanda to give her a hug and kiss, and he gave her a birthday card he made, which Amanda gushed over and put on the fridge. She introduced Joseph to everyone, sang a song and danced with him, and later put him on her lap and got a picture with him. Pretty normal.

As I said, I think my brother forgot that I had been at the party and met Joseph. He was saying that Amanda sometimes behaved inappropriately in front of other guys. He told me about ""Amanda's friend, Joseph"" who came to the party, and described pretty much what Joseph and Amanda actually did, but without mentioning that Joseph is a child. Everything did sound inappropriate if you assume that Joseph is a grown man.

I was pretty sure that no adult Joseph came to the party after I left and did the exact same things as Joseph the child, so I called my brother out. He acted nervous and claimed it was just a joke and he assumed I would know about the child. He definitely didn't act like he was making a joke, he acted like someone who got caught. He said he didn't lie because he never claimed that Joseph was an adult, but people don't talk about little kids as just ""a friend"" without mentioning they're a child.

I tried to challenge him on this but he kept repeating that it was a joke and acted like I was being weird for still talking about it. But I could tell he didn't intend for this to be a joke. I figured that he either is weirdly jealous of a little kid but acted like he was an adult when telling me the story because he knew it was the only way I'd take it seriously, or he doesn't mind the kid, but felt like trashing Amanda and used her behavior with Joseph as a basis for his story.

I'm not sure what to do now. I'd like to tell Amanda because this was such a terrible thing to say about her, but we don't know each other well, so I don't know if I should. Even though I'm suspicious about everything my brother has said, there is the possibility that at least some of what he told me about Amanda is true (though I'm doubting it) so I'm not sure what's the right thing to do."|ThrowRAadmjnkns|False|https://redd.it/el0l2h|2|1.0|0|4|1|relationship_advice
el0l0e|2020-01-06 21:24:05|Me (23M) and my ex GF (22F) broke up and I need advice about my actions|"So, basically the breaking up reason was her searching for her ex BF, lying about it afterwards while we were in serious discussion. I do know that, its not a reason to break up with you SO if he/she looks up her/his ex. I just dont want to deal with lies. She always told me she cant lie at all, but when I asked for why she looked him up, she instantly told me lie without even hesitating. It was really devastating for me that all this time she could have been lied about many things, but really even if she says stupid reason I would believe her no mather what. So for me it was a red flag.

After we broke up, we decided to stay friends but I wasnt very okay with it. She was the one who kept messaging me, trying to talk me etc. But in the end because of the relationship isolation, she was the only one who I spent my time with for 4 months. She was texting me  stuffs like, she wants to get back together, she loves me and goes on. After I caught her lying, in my eyes she is lying about everything even tho its basic stuff. I just couldnt believe her because she broke my trust. And I keep reminding her what she did to me, I will never forgive her about what she did. 

Also while she was saying she still loves me, she wants us get back together, she keep following guys on Instagram that she doesnt know at all even tho she knows I dont like that behaviour. So I blew up on her today told her to fuck off and blocked her. Because for me, if you say someone I love you, you should do acts matching with it otherwise it is very disrespectful for other person. She apologized for it and before I blocked her and unfollowed them but whats done is done, she did all of them knowing whats she doing. 

So here I am wondering, if Im the bad guy here? I know I have jealousy issues, I do even know I have trust issues aswell. So I am wondering if my insecurities ruined our relationship. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; we broke up with SO, after that we kept talking. she always told me she wants us back together but while saying those words she kept following back random guys even tho I know she hates it.

ekyml4|2020-01-06 19:09:39|I (25M) am not as into a girl (24F) as she is into me. This is a long story but in short, she came here to study her masters. We met through a mutual friend, we had a short thing of 10 days and after that, she left for her own country. When she left the distance killed it. Now she is back and...|"Wants to work here full time. I thought she just wanted to be here for new years as many tourists do but she said that she wanted to stay here for 3 months initially and then yesterday she said she wanted to stay here as long as she could. 

Now to the actual problem. 

I am not as into her as she is into me. She came at a time where a relative had passed unexpectedly and a series of other unfortunate scenarios also happened like, for example, I asked out a girl that I had liked for a very long time. There was chemistry between us and she showed obvious interest but in the end, she was seeing someone else and that kinda crushed me for a while. 

&#x200B;

Then she came in my life where I was at my lowest and she liked me like really liked me and that felt really, really good. I was desperate to be loved and she showered me with it. I felt whole for a while. 

After those ten days ended I realized that she was filling a hole in me and that I actually did not like her as much as she liked me. We kept in contact over social media and it lasted over the summer until we had the talk and I told her the distance killed it for me. I was not lying to her as the distance was really making me think clearly about us two and how I wanted her to move on.

Now fast forward a bit and we are in the car talking and she wanted to have the talk and I was conflicted because on one end I did not want a relationship with her but on the other, I really liked her as a friend. She admitted she felt a special connection and that she had not felt like that for a really long time. She asked me if I felt anything similar and I hesitated. I said I did not know how I felt but I was trying to convey that I did not like the obvious difference in attraction, meaning it made me feel uncomfortable that she had these feelings for me and I did not. I wanted desperately to feel the same for her but I just don't feel that way and it's awful.

I don't want her to see me as this perfect being which I felt she was describing me as. Everything about me was so attractive to her but I couldn't say she was as attractive back. I know the feeling of having a crush and it breaks my heart that I cant give her the same love she wants to give me. 

&#x200B;

It ended on a ramble yesterday of me trying to just say that I don't feel the same. She is very smart and ambitious and every guy is incredibly lucky to have her but I can't change how I feel. 

I have my own insecurities that I need to work through and I have my own goals to work at and I wished I had fallen in love with her. I know how this makes me sound, obviously. I know some will say that love is something you get with time and many happy couples did not end up feeling that click in the beginning but that it came later on with time. 

&#x200B;

I know that. I also know that no matter how I think about this its always the same, I don't care for her as much as she cares for me. I like the company, the sex, and the intimacy but not in the long term. 

&#x200B;

Now that I am reading this I think the problem was always me. I wanted a hole to be filled initially and she wanted me but I don't think I want myself and that I hate myself. 

&#x200B;

I asked her if she was feeling okay and she hasn't replied. I felt incredibly guilty as the last thing I want is to hurt her.

el0baq|2020-01-06 21:05:48|Boyfriend (29M) keeps mentioning exes and other girls. I (24F) don't know how to feel about this.|"We've been together for a few months now. Our relationship started dreamy and great, then he became more cold and distant with time, although it was still pretty good. He told me this was a pattern for him in other relationships, and it makes sense since he was neglected as a child. But in the beginning, I did believe we could work on that, I just had to be patient.

Then he started saying concerning things, like ""I don't know if I'll ever feel enough for someone to have a family"". That was pretty hurtful in itself but beyond that, **every time we are together now he mentions at least one anecdote, commentary or dream about an ex, fling, or female friend - not in a casual way but as if he was musing or fantasizing about them.**

I just stay silent or change the subject when he does that. **It hurts me but I don't want to tell him about it because I'm afraid he'll think I'm just a jealous suspicious person.** My ex was like that and I know how bad it feels not to be trusted without a reason. Although there was a period when I suspected he was cheating on me.

One of those days, he mentions something sexual about some friend with benefits he has/had. For some reason, I believed he was speaking in the present tense. I started crying because I thought he was casually admitting he was having sex with her.

I couldn't communicate in my confusion - I hate that about me - so he had to play a guessing game of what I was upset about. When he figured it out he reassured me that that was something from before we were together, that he wasn't cheating and, after I asked him, that he'd tell me if something happened, that he believed in honesty.

Unfortunately, apart from that, there are always little things that won't let me trust him completely.

This was the day before I left for Christmas. Fast track to my return, his behaviour is much warmer and loving, like it was in the beginning of the relationship. He even says he missed me which is something I wouldn't expect from him.

That didn't stop his stories about ex's/female friends which now kill me every time in contrast with his warmer behaviour. Today he mentioned a dream he had involving his best friend that really hurt me, as if he was low-key admitting that he had feelings for her.

But I don't show it.

He's very ambiguous in his phrasing so I am never sure if he means it, or if he thinks that he's just honest if he tells me about all the thoughts he has of other girls. But I can't relate. I have romantic and sexual dreams/thoughts/stories of other people but I don't see a reason to tell him since for me it's just that, not reality.

I know I am in the wrong for not telling him how I feel about this. It pains me to let this fester. I also thought he'd know better not to talk so much about exes after the miscommunication we had before I left for Christmas. Every time he says something about this or that girl, it's like a nice lovely day together has just gone to shreds. And of course, I don't want to censor him.

**Am I being overdramatic? Sometimes I'm afraid he is trying to sabotage the relationship this way, consciously or not.**

**I also want to try and communicate these feelings to him.** If I don't, I know I'll just end up breaking up with him with a stupid explanation when this whole situation could maybe have been easily solved, because I don't know if I can take it anymore.

**Any tips on that?** I don't want to alienate him since he's already averse to comitted long-term relationships, but I can tell he is trying to be closer to me. And I really do have real feelings for him and want this to work.

**TLDR: bf keeps mentioning exes or female friends with a feeling. It hurts me and I'm not communicating that to him. Need communication tips cause I couldn't confront someone for my life :)**"|bunnies4all|False|https://redd.it/el0baq|2|0.75|0|7|1|relationship_advice
el0ar0|2020-01-06 21:04:40|[33/m] My brother [29/m] is likely suffering from depression, may be suicidal, and has cut all contact with family members. What can I do to help him?|"The gist of the problem is in the title, so you can reply broadly to that question. You can also read the following first:

My brother has likely suffered from depression for a while. I say likely because he wasn't diagnosed. He briefly seeked out counseling a few years ago but something went wrong and he swore off ever trying that again. He basically checks off most of the signs of depression.

I thought he was doing better, but over the holidays he had a huge fight about nothing with our parents and he left their place and skipped on Christmas celebrations altogether, much to the chagrin of our parents. I wasn't around during this argument since I live out of town, and I got there after he had already left. Since then, he has stopped communicating with any of us, but we could see him being active on Facebook. 

On New Year Eve, he got into a huge argument with his friends, and as far as I know left the party he was at telling a few people he was going to kill himself. I don't know if it was a cry for help or just grandstanding, but I guess they believed him because one of them called the police. The cops went to his place, knocked, got no response, broke in and cuffed him to bring him to the hospital on suicide watch. He received a psychiatric examination there and was released after a few hours. I know these facts because I have a common friend with him that spoke to me about it out of worry for my brother. 

The following day, he blocked me and all other family members on Facebook. That worried me a lot and I ended calling the police again, though they couldn't do anything since this time my brother had not made any threats that I knew of. I know from common friends that he is alive, since they monitor his behaviour on social media, just to know if he's alive. I know he doesnt talk with any of them. He doesn't answer his door when we go knocking. He doesn't reply to messages. Because of everything that happened, I think my brother skipped work and has been fired from his job, which means he now has no income. 

At this point, I feel out of options. Since he refuses to communicate, I only see 2 options. Either a) continue passively monitoring his online activity until one day he either recovers or kills himself, or b) work with my family to obtain compulsory internment and treatment for him.

ekvxca|2020-01-06 15:55:21|Should I ever ask girls to shave their mustache ?|"So I [26M] was hanging out with another girl[24F] that I met on SweetRing. She is really attractive but whenever we get really close to each other I couldn’t stop staring at her mustache.  I mean I have dated a few girls that had mustache but this girl’s mustache really stands out from her face. (She’s asian but with really white and soft skin, maybe that’s why her dark color mustache stands out so much?) 
So guys what you feel about girls with mustache? And girls, how do you feel about the mustache on your face? Is it disrespectful for us to ask you ladies to shave it ?

Edit: thanks for all the comments, this is really interesting. However, I am not saying that this girl has to shave to meet my criteria nor am I saying girls have mustache are ugly. I’m just genuinely curious if we do get into a relationship or if I get a gf in the future, would it be rude for us to ask you guys to shave it or do you think it’s just as normal as you ladies ask guys to shave."|rickysususu|False|https://redd.it/ekvxca|6|0.69|0|34|1|relationship_advice

el03uf|2020-01-06 20:51:15|I'm (32M) going to permanently cut my parents out of my life. I'm just not sure exactly how to do it, and need help with thinking through the repercussions.|"I could write a book about this, but I'm going to try to be as brief as possible while still including the relevant info...

I am 32M, married to a wonderful 33F for 10+ years. We have two children under the age of 10.

Growing up my mom was emotionally abusive, overly strict, and manipulative. She is still this way. My dad was often absent traveling on business. Because of this I became an emotional ""stand-in"" for a husband to my mom, which I now realize is inappropriate.

My parents have never made the attempt to welcome my wife into the family or treat her like a daughter. My mom has always disliked her. Early in our relationship she openly told me that she was afraid my wife was going to replace her. (For what it's worth I'll say my wife is fantastic and the best person I know. She has made my life better in every way. There is no reason anyone should dislike her.)

I have kept my parents at arm's length for my entire adulthood. I see them only a few times a year and talked to them maybe a few times a month. But we have never been close. My wife eventually got fed up with my parents and has had no contact with them for the past several years. She never asked me to stop seeing them and even encouraged me to do so at times.

Fast forwarding... After having a mental and emotional breakdown last year, my parents invited to let me stay with them despite it putting my marriage and children in jeopardy. Vaguely, I will say that the custody of my children was at risk if I stayed with them, and they knew this. They didn't seem to care about that, they really only seemed to want me ""back.""

Long story short, I'm back home with my wife and kids and feeling better than I ever thought I could. My new outlook on life and consultation with experts has allowed me to see my upbringing in a new way and realize just how unsafe and toxic it was. A few months ago I told my parents I needed some time to process my feelings and asked that they please not contact me until I was ready. This boundary has been violated several times. I firmly and clearly restated the boundary multiple times, and at this point I'm just exhausted by the whole thing.

At this point it seems clear they don't respect my choices, they don't respect my wife, and they don't respect my relationship with my kids. They only care about their own feelings. This is enough for me to finally make the decision that I do not want them to be part of my life anymore in any capacity.

I am trying to figure out the best way to handle this. Is there any reason or obligation I have to calmly and clearly break down for them exactly how I feel they have hurt me and my family? Should I just be blunt and say, ""You're out of my life, don't contact me""? Should I just not ever respond at all and leave them hanging? The one thing I don't really want to do is lash out and spew insults or anything like that. I just don't feel like that would help anyone.

I honestly do not know what I want to do. I don't know if I feel like I need closure or if it's just the guilt of my childhood lingering. I'm also unsure of what I will deal with in the future if I do this. For those who have cut out your parents or families of origin, are there any pitfalls I should look out for? Anything I need to keep in mind?

Before anyone suggests it, I have a counselor who I see regularly and we talk about these issues extensively. I just thought I'd get all the advice I could. Talking about it in any capacity definitely seems to help me. Thank you in advance."|OrbFromOnline|False|https://redd.it/el03uf|2|1.0|0|2|1|relationship_advice

ekzvlw|2020-01-06 20:35:38|Secretly dated someone at work who said it had no potential after three months but is now being super friendly?|"I need some advice! 

TLDR; guy I was secretly seeing at work has broken it off but is acting so friendly. How should I deal with this? I feel like he has led me on for three months and is now stringing me along even further. 

I dated a guy from work for three months. I started working with him three months ago and was pursued by him for a couple of weeks. He asked me on a date, the date went really well, we then slept together. After this he went a bit quiet but then we arranged another date and then dated for three months. We were seeing each other every weekend and having coffee during the week at work.

I am 28 and he is 37. He invited me to meet some of his best friends a couple of weeks in which went really well. We had a lot of fun together and he would talk about his ex a little bit but say that there was nothing sexual there and that they were just really good friends that’s why he ended it.

 He’s never lived with anyone and has not had a relationship longer than three years. Even though I’m younger I have previously been in a six year relationship.

I thought everything was going well, so I asked him if he wanted to meet my brother and sister this January. I made it clear to him that this was a big deal to me and that I wanted to make sure he was on the same page, he said that he was and I was really excited. 

He then went travelling for three weeks over Christmas and New Year, whilst he was away he didn’t message me for 2 1/2 weeks but messaged me on Christmas Day to say happy Christmas and that he needed a phone detox that’s why he didn’t message before. I get quite bad anxiety so not hearing from him for that period of time made me feel quite bad.

When he came back he gave me a Christmas present he had bought whilst traveling and then asked me what I was doing that weekend. He offered to cook for me at his place but then we decided to go out. We had a great time at dinner, we always get along really well and we spoke about some deeply personal things (I would have told him these things had I know what was about to happen).

After dinner we went back to his place and he seemed a little bit distant but I thought he was just tired and a bit ill, he didn’t try and touch me I thought it was quite weird as we haven’t seen each other for four weeks and that’s quite a long time. The next morning he woke up we were chatting he was cuddling me holding my hand, playing with my hands being quite affectionate, I didn’t think there was anything wrong. 

He then turns to me and says you are “you are probably wondering why I didn’t try and have sex with you last night?”, I said that “yes I was wondering why he didn’t?” and he proceeded to tell me “that when you’ve been dating someone for three months it gets to the point where you ask yourself whether you want to go all in or you want to step back and he said that he wanted to step back.” He went on to say that he still spoke to his ex-girlfriend even though there was nothing sexual there and he didn’t fancy her, he was also considering a job in another country and to him these are warning signs that this didn’t have any potential. He asked me how I felt about him and I told him that how I felt didn’t matter in the situation if he wasn’t interested it wasn't relevant, I also told him that I thought he had led me on by agreeing to meet my brother and sister and also giving me a Christmas present a day before. 

He said that he’d given all of his friends gifts and I found this very insulting as we were clearly more than friends. 

When I asked him what he thought was wrong between us he said that there wasn’t anything that was wrong and he wouldn’t change anything that happened and he really enjoyed our time together, he then put his hands in his head in his hands and looked like he was reflecting on everything. He told me if I thought of anything else I wanted to say that I should message him, I didn’t message him.

 He has since messaged me about an in joke that we had that was quite personal and I think it’s a bit insensitive. I’m not sure if he’s just trying to seem like a nice guy or if he’s just trying to check that I’m okay, he messaged me and said that he hoped I had a good weekend even though on Saturday he told me that I wasn’t worth his effort. 

I’m really confused, I feel like he’s giving me false hope and I don’t know what to do. He has also sent an email cc’ing a lot of people in saying thank you for my hard work on a project that we are both involved in.

I’m not sure if he is just not very emotionally intelligent or if he is trying to control the situation? I never replied to his message about the in joke as his message made me feel hopeful that he had changed his mind and now I just feel like a fool."|Flower-1234|False|https://redd.it/ekzvlw|2|1.0|0|6|1|relationship_advice

After meeting, we have kept in contact ever since. He always asks me when can we see each other - whether that's here in America where both his family and I live....or when will I visit him in the DR.  We already had the ""what are we"" talk and we both like each other and care about each other. My main concern is will a long distance relationship like this even work? He lives in a totally different country than me... He's the father of a 3 year old boy and he claims he's not with the mother... only for the best interest of the child. Which has been his story since day 1. His mother (my hairdresser) says that she likes me for her son and wants him to come over to the USA to live a better life and wants him to get married.... For me, that gave me a red flag... And I even spoke to him it and he told me his mom is just desperate for him to be happy in general. Anyways, recently his family that lives here in the USA went back to the DR on vacation.... and I have been seeing lots of photos on social media with his ex (mother of his child) with the family (but not with them together) mainly group photos..... And I can't help but think.... Is he lying? Are they actually together? I noticed he has been distance with me as far as calling and texting too. I'm not really hearing from him like normally since he's with his family. Feeling  overwhelmed inside because I don't want to get hurt.

I 've been living in my parents house here in TX.They primarily live out of State in NY and are only here in TX for holidays, some part of winter, other occasions . I make decent money and have a good size emergency fund. During the holidays, I was forced to speak with toxic extended family members whom I clearly expressed I didn't want to have contact with. It really didn't sit well with me afterwards .. I didn't feel respected as a person. I felt like a man with no balls. Another occasion I came back home and found a confidential mail from my bank opened, yet my dad blatantly said it was not sealed when it arrived.( I have since solved this problem) I cannot have a normal adult life when they are at home. I can't even date with regularity because I can't have sex - with my parents in the other room. They went to NY briefly and are returning to TX in a few days. Yesterday, we had another argument over them trying to make me do something I didn't want to, at the end of which they threatened to kick me out of the house, saying i should prepare to pack my things. I have been looking at places and I could make my decision today. At the end of the day, they are my parents . I love them and I don't want to ruin my relationship with them. I believe they are going to guilt me and shame me as soon as learn that I actually moved out. This may be partly because they may not have that feeling of my dependence on them, and they would probably need to make arrangements to manage the home while it is vacant. However,I don't ever want to be dependent on anyone again to the extent that I could be threatened with homelessness or anything at all. If anyone is providing me shelter then I don't want it to be held over my head as leverage.  Naturally I am a bit scared as it a big change, but I feel ready.

We’ve been dating for about a year and a quarter, and my girlfriend and her ex dated for three years, ending about 3 years ago. They hadn’t really talked up until 8 months ago, when he texted her again, which is where our problems started.

We argued about her talking to him a solid amount but eventually I said it was fine because she said her feelings were totally gone and she just wanted to be friends with him. Now fast forward 7 months to when she went home for break, and she hung out with him twice. She didn’t tell me she was hanging out with him either and we had agreed that if they hung out she’d tell me in advance, and I asked her if she thought she’d see him and she said no after she already had done it. She did tell me when she got back from break though. 

She said she felt a little bit of residual romantic feelings for him when they hung out. However, I read a bit of her journal (I know it’s fucked up to do that) and I found a different story. She said in her journal that she’d do anything to be with him and she wishes he cared for her like she cares for him. 

I don’t know what to do. I really love her and I think she loves me too, but she’s way more into her ex then I thought and it’s crushing my confidence. Should I break things off? Is there something I could do? Or am I acting crazy and need to calm down and just let things play out.

ekxtk9|2020-01-06 18:12:16|Mom [49] and I [22M] watched & joked about Michelle Wolf joking about moms’ curiosity about their son's penis|"We watched Michelle Wolf's new Netflix special ""Joke Show"" - here's the transcript:

""Do you think moms want to know how their sons’ penis turned out?...I just think she had a lot to do with that, and then she never got to see what grade she got. Think about it, she grew the penis for a while, and then she had the baby, and for several years made sure the penis was safe and clean, and then this poor woman sent that penis out into the world, and she never got to see how the movie ended. I think, men, I think you should show your mom your penis. I think you’re out there showing your penis to people who don’t want to see it, show it to the one person… who really wants to see it. Your mommy! Go ahead, pull out your phones right now! I know y’all got a dick pic on there! Send that sweet, sweet dick pic to your mommy! And she’ll be like, “Oh! There’s my little guy.”

We were laughing hard I guess to make it less awkward! Mom joked so are you gonna send me a pic?! I was like are most moms really curious?! She said probably - if you have a dick pic you don't have to show me but I'll admit I'm curious. I was like what??!! Mom was like it's not sexual, but I wonder how it turned out. We just awkwardly laughed.

So to quote Michelle Wolf, ""do you think moms want to know how their sons’ penis turned out?"" Do you think I should actually send my mom a pic? I don't want it to be creepy but I think Michelle Wolf does make a good point that there's probably no one who is as curious about it as your mom."|ThrowRAmwolf|False|https://redd.it/ekxtk9|4|0.8|0|17|1|relationship_advice
ekzoxs|2020-01-06 20:22:41|Am I getting close to a fake friend?|"My boyfriend and I don’t have many friends but the ones we do have I hold close to my heart and really let them in. As I’ve gotten older I’ve learned that quality of friendships is far greatest than quantity. Recently we have began hanging out with a couple and at first they seemed super genuine and nice. However, as time has gone on I see a lot of flaws with them and some I consider dealbreakers but my boyfriend really likes them. Here are some of the traits I really dislike: 
- They’re extremely stingy to the point they never tip at restaurants or bars, and feel zero remorse doing so. 
- my boyfriend even bought us all a round of drinks on his bday then they acted so weird when it was their turn to pay for the next round 🙄
- I’ve caught them trying to wiggle their way out of paying bills or returning items that they clearly used just to get their money back. 
- they have no other friends and always say to us that we are their only friends even though I don’t consider us that close 
- they have started making judgmental comments about my boyfriend’s income because he has a trust, and it comes off extremely jealous and competitive the way they word things that he doesn’t have a job even though that’s his choice and why do they care so much?! 
- they’re overly lovey dovey in front of people and it’s honestly just weird. Like we get it you’re in love but is this some weird competition?
-they can’t laugh at themselves ever and get all weird if we make a lighthearted joke. My partner and I tease all the time and have that type of humor. 

As I’m writing this it seems like they suck and I hate them. However, they can be really nice and fun to hang out with but I hate how I see red flags. My boyfriend says I nitpick them but I don’t feel this way with our other friends so I don’t know if I should trust my gut. He also has been extremely off with friends before and has had complete users as besties. 

Do these seem like small flaws, am I being too harsh or do you think these are valid reasons to not want to be friends with someone?

ekwgjt|2020-01-06 16:35:15|My boyfriend (M28)’s ‘second hand’ trauma about *MY* (F25) sexual abuse as a child is really getting to me.|"Hi reddit fam.

Ill get straight to it. Recently I told my boyfriend about some hectic trauma I experienced when I was a child. I was sexually abused for 3 years or so and I only started dealing with it properly in the last year. I went through some very dark moments and days dealing with it, often at times never telling my boyfriend the extent of how badly I was doing in order to not make him feel horrible about it because whenever I did bring it up, he got weird with me and sad and so I was fine to not share everything with him. I think it’s healthy to not share every ounce of emotion with your partner. 
I also never wanted my trauma to be a burden on him and our relationship. 
(I am happy to say I have triumphed some very hurtful things that happened in my past and I am whole, happy and brave person.)


The only thing now is that he has gone into a depression about what happened in my past. 
He has taken it on to an exceptional degree and let’s me in on every triggering and horrible feeling he is having. 

It makes me feel guilty and terrible that he is going through this.
Every night for the last 2 weeks he has phoned me in tears saying how he can’t cope with the thoughts of me being abused when I was young. He wakes me up at night, he messages me “I’m really hurting and don’t know what to do” type of texts when I’m at work. 

I have been drained of my energy to try lift him up and be supportive and understanding and gentle and kind. All I try do everyday is find new ways to make him feel better and feel guilty that I’m feeling okay and he is not.
Today he asked me if we will survive this. I feel resentful because it is my trauma, I worked so hard to get through it, and part of me doesn’t understand why he is taking it on like it happened to him. 

He says he feels so cut up and horrible because of how much he hurts over something so terrible happened to someone he loves so much. 
I have laid boundaries saying sometimes hearing about his hurt affects me. And his retaliation is that he needs me there because letting me in on what’s going on makes him feel better, and he would rather not lie to be about ‘being okay’ when he is not. 

The past is the past and I really want to move on from such a dark space. He has been in this space for a few months now, but it has gotten really bad recently. I’m not sure how to navigate this space. 

TL:DR - my boyfriend is in a depresssion because of sexual abuse trauma that happened to me when I was young. He pulls me into his depressive and intense emotional space everyday and I’m not sure how to deal with this. He would rather share how badly he is doing with me all the time because it makes him feel better, when he knows it affects me badly."|WhereIsOlive|False|https://redd.it/ekwgjt|4|1.0|0|14|1|relationship_advice

A month ago he tells me he met this girl while surfing and kicked her head underwater by accident while trying to dive under a wave. When he told me this I was like oh shit that’s fucked up, you owe her a drink! Hahah and he said well the thing is... She happened to pop up on a friend’s ig story and he replied to it saying hey can you tell your friend I’m sorry I think I kicked her earlier today while surfing. I guess the friend put them in contact and they started DMing each other. I’m not sure exactly what they messaging about but I guess they got around to talking about what she does who she is and how old she is (21f). She said she just moved to our state and has no other friends but the one that posted her on ig?? So my bf said that she asked if she can join him whenever he surfs because she has no one to surf with. So all in the same conversation he told me he’s surfed with her a couple times and that was that.

after the conversation I did not express and frustration/anger/jealousy I told him I was happy he made a friend. And in my head I thought to myself I’d probably do the same too. She was never brought up again until yesterday.

Yesterday I told him how his mom offered to drop us off at the airport in 2 months (we bought tickets for a 3 week vacay in south east Asia). I said all we need is our ride back which can probably be my sister since I’m dropping her off and picking her up at the airport next week. Then he brings up, “well I’m already going there Monday.” I ask him why and he said to pick up a friend. I ask him what friend? And he says oh that girl I told you she’s from **** she is coming back to town tomorrow and she had nobody else to pick her up... so I responded oh yeah all that for a girl just met? And laughed it off.

Me in my head: BUT COME ON wtf a girl you just met? You are not going to drive an hour to airport and an hour back for a girl you met? You do that for family close friends and your gf! I wouldn’t do that if the tables were turned...

I got home and went to his IG following (which is sorted by most recent) and found her right away. I know this because she had her age and the two states she commutes from in her bio.

She’s cute! She totally cute. She’s his type. We’re similar in style. I could see why he’s doing her all these favors *eyerolls*.

Anyways today I’m planning to confront him and ask him about details. 

Idk if I’m going to just set him in his place or break up with him. How does this sound to you guys?

EDIT: for more details..

I’m a surfer too. I’m not as advanced as him so we surf different spots.

Also the airport ride is tomorrow, on Monday.

He’s never acted like this about another girl. We can tell each other things. Almost anything. That’s our relationship. But for some reason he’s been really dismissive about her. So have I though but it’s because I was trying to give him his space and give him the benefit of the doubt about her being just a friend. Which still may be true but knowing him, and knowing us, it’s just fishy. And I’m already hurt. I couldn’t sleep last night which is why I posted this at 6 am. I am honestly calling out of work to think about it and collect my thoughts. This relationship means a lot to me.

I have no confidence and his family already isn’t a huge fan of me and I don’t want to be a moody brat in front of everyone. Does anyone else have to deal with this bs? How do you cope?

ekzk9s|2020-01-06 20:13:38|I [29f] read my boyfriend [34m] of almost 1.5 years texts and I’m pissed at what I found|"Edit: forgot to include TL; DR:
I read my boyfriends texts this morning and found that he’s continued to text his ex after I expressed concern and discomfort about it, and I’m pissed. Am I overreacting? 

My boyfriend and I will have been together for a year and a half next month. We live in the south, but I wouldn’t say either of us are conservative or traditional. I was wary of the dating app thing, but friends of mine have found seriously meaningful, committed relationships, and, lucky for me, so did I with this guy, I think. 

For the first couple of months, I was on my best behavior. I tried to be cool, care-free girl, but when he kept bringing up his ex and things she did, I was like ok, dude, I don’t care about her and frankly, if she’s as awful as you say she is, neither should you. So he stopped talking about her. 

A few months ago, my phone crapped out and I had no way of talking to anyone so I used his phone to send some texts to my best friend. Well, I scrolled through his texts, not reading any, and noticed the name of one girl that I knew he’d dated in the past had the ‘do not disturb’ moon beside it. Red flag. I really try to think before I speak or act, so when I saw those texts, I sat with it and marinated on it for weeks. I thought, “don’t be the crazy, jealous girlfriend. It’s probably nothing” but it continued to bother me so, finally,  I confronted him. He got kind of defensive and told me how they ended amicably and on good terms and that they were just friends. So my thinking was if they’re just friends, etc, why have it so that he wouldn’t receive notifications from her? Cause he would feel guilty or something about it was my guess. 

So I let it go, assuming that was it and he was totally trustworthy and I was pms’ing or something. Then, a couple of months later, somebody on Instagram was sending him selfies. Of what nature, I don’t know. He got defensive again saying how I should give him the benefit of the doubt. I was furious. He claimed they posted something troubling, so he reached out. I thought that was bullshit and he was just trying to cover his ass, but I begrudgingly let it go. 

Well, I had a bad dream last night, and against my better judgement, I went to his computer this morning and went through his texts. Again, I find texts to this ex of his from just 3 months ago. Only this time, she told him that they couldn’t be friends and he shouldn’t text her anymore because she doesn’t want to do anything to mess up her current relationship, etc. Right on! But now, I am so pissed off. 

Yes, it was wrong of me to go snooping, but my gut has been right about these things every time. If I hadn’t read his texts, I wouldn’t be feeling this way now, but, presumably, he’d just continue to lie by omission, as far as I’m concerned. These things keep happening and I trust him less and less every time. I really love him and have even considered proposing to him, but I just feel so stupid. How can I be so naive? Maybe he doesn’t really see a future with me the way I do. Does anyone relate or have any advice? Am I being way too sensitive? Should I set real boundaries, and if so, what kind? I don’t want to give him an ultimatum, but I’m currently at a loss."|throwRAnotonespecial|False|https://redd.it/ekzk9s|2|0.75|0|13|1|relationship_advice

ekzhkb|2020-01-06 20:08:35|Girlfriend keeps breaking up and wanting to get back together again|"Throwaway account because people I know are aware of my account.

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about 15 months now. We are both 21 years old. 8 months into our relationship we had sex for the first time.  We were both virgins.

10 months into our relationship we were at her house and she got all serious. She said she didn’t want to be in a relationship anymore. She said it wan’t another guy. She said there was nothing wrong with me other than she wanted to be alone. I said ok and left and moved on.

Everyday after the breakup she would call me and still want to see me. She even waited one night outside in her car for me to walk out of the restaurant I work at.

The first week after this breakup I tried to pretend she didn't exist. I worked out at the gym and hung out with friends. 5 days later we were pretty much back together like normal. She said she missed me too much to break up for good.

Then last week (on New Years Day) we were sitting in a restaurant and she got serious all of sudden again. That’s when she said she didn’t want to be in a relationship anymore and just wanted to be alone. I asked her if she was serious, because she doesn’t get another chance. I drove her home, and on the way I told her once she gets out there’s no 3rd chance. She cried, gave me a hug and I watched her walk into her house (she lives with her parents).

To summarize, she broke up with me after 10 months of dating, then again after 18 months of dating.

I doubled my efforts into self improvement mode. Worked out at the gym like never before, hung out with friends that were female. I ignored her calls during the first 2 days. She must have called me about 4-6 times per day. She then had her best friend call me, which I answered. Her friend asked me how I was, and before I could answer my twice ex-girlfriend came on the phone to talk to me. I hung up.

A few days after I agreed to go to dinner with her and a movie. Everything seemed pretty normal despite a little guarded on my side. Before the movie started she said her feelings haven’t changed and she still feels like she doesn’t want to be in a relationship. Internally I began writing her off emotionally. I started to stop caring.

After this dinner and movie “date” I saw her again last night. She invited me late after work. We had sex and she told me that she loved me, didn’t want to lose me, and doesn’t want to be without me.  I really didn't give her an answer other than I told her I'd think about it.

I don’t know what the hell is going on with this girl. She’s fickle as hell, and I feel like I can’t trust her. She has a history of low self-esteem and depression.

She swears there is nobody else. I don’t really have a question, other than I’m confused as hell by her."|t-boyharris|False|https://redd.it/ekzhkb|2|1.0|0|10|1|relationship_advice

He is my first very serious relationship, we have discussed getting married, kids, etc. Shortly after I moved in with him, I found out he had seen his ex girlfriend a few times without telling me. They saw each other in a group setting, and he said he was just nervous to tell me because he knew it would upset me, but now I am SUPER pissed off and I feel like I can't trust him as much as I thought I could. Personally, I don't keep in contact with my exes. I don't feel the need to, they're just not  relationships I am interested in maintaining. I don't know this ex girlfriend but I know they dated for awhile and had a very hectic relationship (high highs and low lows). I was absolutely head over heels in love with him the 2 years of our relationship, but frankly this keeps coming up, I keep finding out about a new place they hung out and it makes me feel like I don't know him as well as I thought I did and skeptical of our entire relationship.

I can't tell if I am being too harsh, or if I even have the right to be angry. I think that there are many people out there that have very evolved stances on their relationships with their exes- I am not one of them, but I'm not sure if its fair to have the same expectations for my boyfriend and his exes."|MudAlertParis|False|https://redd.it/ekxkzt|3|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice

I said “that’s fine if last night is the last night I do you :)” I immediately corrected it and said  “do see you*” 

After this she promptly began to say things like: “that’s all you we’re in this for? To “do me?””
“Wow I thought you were different guess I’m just stupid”
“I’m not sure how you mistype “see” to “do”

The crazy thing is we never had sex so I didn’t even “do her”. Plus I’ve never said I wanted to “do a girl” in reference to sex in my entire life.

Every attempt I tried to convince her it was just a typo failed, and now I’m not sure what to do. Should I continue to try to convince her? Or just leave it.

We are currently living in different cities due to work responsibilities but this is just temporary. He is under a lot of stress and we can't see each other as much as we would want to and it creates tension in our marriage. I think he also misses a lot of things about home.

It did not work out between us for a lot of reasons that are not relevant to this post. For the last six months, I have developed some feelings for a close friend. We hung out together, but nothing ever happened between us while I was still in a relationship. We had our issues and my friend was aware of this, but cheating was not and never will be an option. 

After my breakup, I got drunk with said friend and she explained that she has developed feelings for me over the course of the last few months as well. We ended up sleeping with each other, and spent a lot of time together. Yesterday, she told me that her feelings are more serious than she thought, and for that exact reason she wants to break off whatever was going on recently, as she is not ready to seriously date someone. We now have to go back to being just friends, after becoming way more than that. 

I am unsure how to process this change in dynamic again: Part of me does not understand how you can have strong feelings for someone yet still do not want to date, but I do accept that decision. What I am struggling with more is that we are now both aware that the other person has feelings, yet we both have to adapt to being just friends again, after having what seemed like a short “try out” relationship.

Any way to ""follow up""?"|"(Posted this the other day without a response, so I'm trying again.) I've traveled a lot for class and because of that I've been fortunate to  make a number of international friends throughout school. International  friendships are often difficult to keep going (mostly due to timezone scheduling hell and a lack of proximity), but I've been pretty close to one friend in particular for something like six years now. We had a lot of fun chatting and discussing the things that make international friends really fun -- sharing languages, talking about different cultural perspectives, he's shown me around his country some, etc. Communication has been a bit more sparse for the past year or so, though, and I figured that was because neither of us were fortunate enough to be students anymore; he finished his masters in a technical  management area two years ago, and I defended my PhD shortly after. I was actually kind of surprised he took the time to (virtually) attend my defense - they're not known for being the most interesting things in the world, so it really meant a lot to me that he made the time to tune in. In general, I like reaching out  to people when I think of them (not super often as to be bothersome, though I always worry about that; I'll get in touch on the order of every several months) to try and keep friendships alive, but for the past six months, I haven't gotten anything back from this friend in particular. A couple things to note:

1. He's had a significant other almost as long as I've known him. They bought a house together shortly after he finished school.
2. Our last real conversation seemed perfectly jovial: I wished him a happy birthday and he told me a somewhat embarrassing story that involved a little too much alcohol at his celebration.
3. I  don't think I've been blocked and we're still friends on whatsapp & Facebook. I hardly ever use Facebook, but I noticed I can still see his ""last online"" time on whatsapp. My latest messages have all gotten read eventually, though it took a while.

While I certainly don't want it to be time for this friend to exit my life, I realize that we're both entering a new stage of adulthood and friendships tend to ebb and flow at those kinds of transition points. I don't want to bother him or make him uncomfortable if his intent is to distance himself from me, and I'm hoping this is all just due to both of us being preoccupied with other things. So I'm here to ask: is there a good, graceful way of letting this friend know he means a lot to me but the lack of communication is killing our friendship? Or should I just follow my instincts and let this one fade?"|ThrowRACrossPolymer|False|https://redd.it/ekz0tz|2|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice

ekyysc|2020-01-06 19:33:41|My now 3 year-girlfriend kind of cheated on me for the second time|"Hey you all, as you might see, english is not my first language.

I (M23) have a big issue with my girlfriend (20) for three years now i do need some advice on. This is going to be a longer shot because i have to tell you various situations first so you could build a good advice for me. I am so thankful for everybody reading my story and telling me their opinion on it.  

  
To me: I am a kind of introvert guy who does not like to meet new people, because of my mentally abusive stepdad. Im struggeling a little from depression, but not to bad and if you get used to me and i like you really much, id be more happy to actually make you happy than myself. But this does only kind of count for my mum, my brother and my actual girlfriend, if i am really in love with her.

To her: She is a bisexual girl (which i have no problem with), who was raped by her stepfather (her mother didnt want to believe it) and sexually assaulted by her ex-boyfriend. She is kind of extrovert, but really does not talk about feelings at all.

So basically i met this girl on a dating app. We liked each other pretty much so i asked her for a date once. By this time she literally just startet a relationship to some other guy, but some weeks later we just met as friends. We talked much about deep problems and stuff and i guess we found pretty well to each other. So there were times she slept at my home in my bed (me being a gentlemen because i respected her beeing in a relationship) but still her boyfriend did not liked that at all.   
Some days later she told me about her abusive ex, who threatend her these days with naked pictures and sex tapes of her and said he would publish them on Facebook if she would not have sex with him. I went straight to the police with her and we solved the problem, her ex received an police report and things went on.

She was thankful and while some time passes, she quits the relationship with her then bf. We started with having pretty good and frequent sex (like 1-2 times a day) and ended in having a nice relationship. We do fit together pretty well. The first 6 months were awesome like these ""pink sunglasses"" months everybody is talking about. But after this period of time, things started to become a little stange. I felt something was´nt as usual, but she mentioned everytime ""everythings fine"". So i believed her.   
In the following year, she broke up our relationship 3 times. She told me the reasons were firstly ""I am bi and i miss the relationship to a woman sometimes"", secondly ""I think i dont love you so much any more"" and thirdly ""you deserve something better than me because i cant talk about feelings etc.""   
This was kind of the time she told me super drunk, that she got raped by her stepdad, which hit me pretty hard. But after all she did not want to talk about it any more. 

Because we were so in love, these break ups resulted only in up to 2 weeks pauses. Additionally she met a psychiatrist who told her to speak about her problems with me, but she did not after all. 

After these breakups we talked about our whole relationship and i told her i need to know if something is going on in her mind, and if it is the most embarrasing thing, I will be there for her, becuase i really love her. She promised me to and we went on. 

In fact she started to talk about her feelings a little more and another 6 months passed, we did not have that much sex in that time, and i wanted to know why, because before we enjoyed it pretty much. Also i found her pretty often texting on her Smartphone and hiding it from me. I confronted her about having something with this man she texts frequently, but she called him a friend of her mum and i believed..

One eavening i was supposed to send me some data from her smartphone while she was asleep and shocked while seeing her most recently Whatsapp message ""good night, daddy"", not addressed to me of cause. 

I was shocked,  waked her instantly and we had a very long and deep talk about her feelings and her mindset. She finally told me after about 2 years of knowing her that she had a ddlg (daddy doom and little girl) fetish she was to embarresed to talk with me about. She messeged that guy about 4 month, while sending him pictures of herself with ONLY pampers on. Also they met 2 times in public, to get to know each other. But she said all they did was talking.  At this moment i was kind of done with the world and now struggeling from depression again. I needed some free space for me and so i stopped the contact for about a month. 

Within this month i met another girl who i knew through the same dating app as my girlfriend. She texted me about a week after my gf and i broke up so i thought this could be a good deflection from my gf, but i did not feel any kind of affliction to this girl at all. My girlfirend messeged me again and we met up to talk about things. I instantly talked to her about the other girl and she was kind of sad and jealous, but not angry.

After our conversation i agreed in giving her another chance, because she said she would never hurt me that much again. She knew it was like the worst mental pain i have ever experienced in my live. She said she could suppress her fetish and would love me too much to lose me. 

So we were going on, having a good relationship, with a little to less sex (like 1 time a week) which i told her is not enough for me. She said we could do it more often, but every time i was to get it on, she declined by weird reasons she has never mentioned before (tiredness, sickness, headache, and so on). I felt like something is wrong again, and so i come to the last weekend including today. 

She has a very good old friend (F) from a big city like 5 hours ago. Gf told me her friend would come around at Chrismas, which was fine for me because i went an a snowboarding trip by that time until the start of January. So she slept in the hotel and i felt like everything was fine. This female friend was obvisouly having a couple as friends which i call Male and Female from now on. I knew about these because she said thaat she met them at her other girlfriend. My gf told me M+F would come around at Silvester and they all (i thought 4) will have a got time.

  
But than last sunday happened. My gf asked if M+F could leave their cases in my flat so they could spend the last day togethere. First of all my gf was excited for me to meet them and they were super nice and we liked each other. But then she did not ask me if i want to join them all. This was a little stange to me and i asked her afterwards. She just said she is sorry and did not think about it. I was like fine and went on.

But today Male texted me because i guess he liked me and wanted to chat a little bit. This got promptly pretty akward because he said things like "" i would love to move for \[my gfs name\] to your city"", ""i cant wait to see her again"" and someting with a triangle relationship between M,F and my girlfirend. 

At this time i freaked out again, went home from work, called my gf in school and she immediately come to speak to me. I found out she never mentioned me to M+F and this previously mentioned girlfriend for Christmas never was in our city, she spent the whole 12 days with Male und Female and they did (as she said non sexual) baby stuff like wrapping and so in person. Furthermore the girlfriend and M+F dont know each other and the time in November, when she obviously went to that actual girlfriend she met the M+F couple through that fetish app she used the last time and met them in person for the first time.  I am so shocked, sent her home and now i am here writing this, discovering more and more lies while texting to my girlfriend.   


Now i really need some advice from you:  
She tells me this time she would talk to me and try out this fetish stuff with me (i have never said i wouldnt like it, i simply did not test it but i would be down). But it was the second time preferring lying to me and cheating on me instead of a simply conversation which could have fixed all our issues. I have to say i love her pretty much and would do anything for her. I really want her to be happy, unless i am not. I know this is truely stupid, but this is my character and i cant just stop being so, even if it was better for me.. also i kind of fall into a hole of depression again everytime i think about being alone again and i miss her if i just think about this situation now. I think we fit together so well and losing her would kill me inside. I know you should cut toxic people out of your life and there are many red flags, but i cant just leave her alone again. Her mother is terrible (sometimes forgets to buy food etc) and the abusive stepdad comes to the flat like 2-3 times a week (but he isnt abusive any more). I feel so sorry for her and really dont know what to do now.

ekyxve|2020-01-06 19:31:52|I left my girlfriend who lost her attraction to me, will she ever come back?|"My (23m) girlfriend (20f) and I started off dating in the same city, she moved 2 hours away and we did long distance for a few months. Everything was great, I was also thinking about moving to that same city but didn't have anything pushing me to move somewhere new without knowing anyone. Having her there with me was a great motivation. 6months in and I decided to move to her city. 

She started losing attraction to me over a month ago. It started very slowly and with time, it wasn't getting better. 

We would always have a great time together, we would never get into arguments. 

After spending the holidays together with each other's family and having a great time, I decided to bring the issue back up as I knew the problem would have struck us again, I suggested she took time for herself as she didn't know what she wanted. 

After 4 days of no contact, I asked her how she was (I know 4 days isn't long at all, but she was leaving for a family trip for 2 weeks). Me not knowing the outcome would have lead to me digging myself in a deep hole. 

I asked her if she saw a possibility of us working through this together when she came back or if she was considering breaking up. She didn't have an answer so I decided it would be better to break up.

This was 1 day ago, I'm now living in this new city where I don't have many friends but there are better work opportunities. Things are difficult but I know I have to focus on myself. Deep down, I hope she realizes during her trip that she was happier with me. 

Does anyone have similar experiences that could help me with my situation?"|mathieufoote|False|https://redd.it/ekyxve|2|1.0|0|4|1|relationship_advice

Beautiful. Funny. And all around someone I'm enjoying being with. I'm not trying to move the relationship very fast as I myself only became single a few months ago.

She has a dark past that I won't go into  much detail about. She's tried to commit suicide years ago when she was younger and we spoke about this. She said it would never happen again because she knows  now that was a mistake. 

On Friday she had an episode. Something from her past snuck up on her. And she spiraled out of control. I was suppose to see her Saturday night and she never replied to my messages until around midnight that she was in the hospital.

I haven't been able to see her. I called her last night and she was a crying mess saying she was sorry and felt so shitty. I've been texting her but she's been mostly unresponsive. I don't wanna come off as pushy. I know I'm not anyone right now but I know we like each other a lot and I am very worried about her.

 I just wanna help.  But I'm not sure how exactly. Everytime I wanna talk to her I have no idea what to say. This is the first time I've been in a situation like this.

Any advice would be highly appreciated. I wanna help her get passed this dark time."|JustFiguring-ItOut|False|https://redd.it/ekyx4i|2|1.0|0|33|1|relationship_advice
ekyw71|2020-01-06 19:28:25|My girlfriend (F 25) doesn't talk as much as she used to and is always talking with her new co-worker.|"My girlfriend (25) and I (25) have been dating for a little over a year, we are both in love, our relationship has been good overall with its ups and downs like any other relationship. She's very emotional and, in my opinion, a bit depressed.

Pretty much throughout our whole relationship except for the last couple months (around the time she got a new job) we would talk a lot, be it through texts, calls and obviously in person. More importantly, she would tell in the moment about important stuff and about how she was feeling, for example, she got into a fight with a couple of her best friends and she called me the day it happened and kept me updated of the situation, if someone hitted on her, how an ex tried to get back with her, and would even tell me about her dreams everyday. When we went out she wouldn't be using her phone except for work-related stuff.

Now she got a new job and because she doesn't drive, she normally goes with a co-worker whom she has became good friends with and I have also met. Recently I have felt her distant because she does no longer tell me about important stuff, takes long to text back and I know she's always on her phone, and she's always texting her co-worker  even when we go out but she doesn't hide it and has even show me some funny stuff they text. When we are together everything is great, she tells me how she's madly in love with me and wants to marry me but she recently told me how the last month she hasn't feeling well, she says that everything is great but is scared to lose me in the future, that she's been having dreams about doing bad stuff to me and has been dreaming with her ex for a while. She also told me that a friend she used to like told her he liked her and she told him that she was in love with me and she just wanted them to remain friends. Normally she would tell me this kind of things when they happened but not anymore. 

Once we got into an argument and after we talked she told me that she thought I was jelous about her co-worker and that I shouldn't worry about him and how she wouldn't do anything to hurt me (the argument didn't have anything to do with him). We also went to a party with her friends including the co-worker which got really drunk I he told me how I shouldn't worry about him and that he doesn't want anything beyond a friendship with my girlfriend. She's become really trustful with him and now tells him everything, sometimes she mentions stuff which I have no clue about and then she remembers that she told her co-worker and not me.

I'm not the jelous type of boyfriend, nor do I care if my girlfriend has really good guy friends, that's completely normal and I would never tell her whom she can and can't talk to. I hadn't worry about her co-worker before but I'm worried about  how she confides more with him now and I feel she talks to him more than me. Overall our relationship is great and that's the only problem (at least for me) that we have. I want to tell her about this but I don't want to be seem as insecure or something like that. Should I just mention it in a subtle way or fully ask her what's up with her co-worker?

ekvqsv|2020-01-06 15:41:54|Advice on new relationship|"Long story short I (F26) had a FWB (M27) for 9 months. Over that time it slowly turned from once a week booty call kinda situation to spending the entire weekend together. A few months ago I brought up that I had feelings and that I couldn’t do the FWB anymore. He was really upset about it and said he had feelings but was scared etc... we stopped seeing each other and taking.. we then somehow kept finding our way back to each other and started hanging out more and more. Every time we did it just felt ‘right’. In the end it felt like a relationship not a FWB. After such a nice weekend with him I decided that it had to end for good, because I just couldn’t keep doing the casual thing. To my surprise he actually wanted to ‘try’ the whole offical dating thing. We spent 3 day’s straight with each other and it was so lovely. He deleted Tinder without me even asking and he has been super nice, talking over text more than normal. 

Now this is where I need advice. I’ve been single for maybe 10 months and before that I was in a 6 year relationship. I have forgotten what it is like at the start of a new one. I feel like if I message too much or if I ask to hang out I’m being annoying or I’ll ‘scare’ him off. But I know I need to keep talking for it to even work haha
He seems a bit shy/scared to message first or ask to hang out but he always messages me back straight away if I message him

I’m so happy to be with him because I honestly really like him :) 
But I’m so scared I’m going to psych myself out and end up ruining it. 
How do I chill out and stop being a scaredy-cat and make it work?

ekx152|2020-01-06 17:15:16|No One Has Heard From My Ex (?) Bf For Little Over a Month|"No one in his family uses Reddit, but still using a Throw away account.

My boyfriend and I dated for three years, back in October, he wanted to go on a break to work on himself. I was accepting and very proud of him for actually going to get the help he needed, and I understand why he wanted to go on this break. I personally don't believe in breaks. Breaks = break up in my eyes. 

Anyway, even though we were on this break, he still acted like we were together, which is why I added the '?' in the title. He always wanted to hang out with me (of course, I wanted to see him as well), he'd tell me how much he loves me and everything just seemed normal. I brought this up to him the one day, how we were on this break, yet we acted like we weren't and in a way, it gave me weird mixed signals. He reassured me saying ""we will get back together, blah blah blah, just give me time while I really work on myself, you can go out and do whatever you want, don't think I'm trying to hold you back."" Okay, that's fine. We continued on. 

Then, the one day (this was the beginning of December) we were texting and he asked if we can hang out the next day. I said yes. I havent heard from him since. I tried texting, calling him, checking his socials. Never answered my texts, phone straight to voicemail, not active on anything. I shrugged it off, stopped trying to reach out to him. I know December is the worst month for him, due to something truamatic happening to him and his family so I figured he wanted time to himself. Still would've been nice to have known instead of ghosting me. 

Unfortunetly, before Christmas, my grandfather who had a big part of my life passed unexpectedly. This was when I tried to reach out again. No replies, phone straight to voice mail, not active on anything. So, I decided to message his sister, asking her if she heard from her brother, and asking her to let him know when the service is, in case he wanted to go. She told me, no one has heard from him in a few weeks. Not her, not his father, not his god parents (who he lives with). No one. I asked some of my friends who talk to him and they said they haven't heard from him either.  His sister said his car broke, so he was staying with someone closer to town where he was working, but he ended up losing that job. 

However, she said he will sometimes talk to their aunt and use her truck when he needs it, etc. Atleast I know he's not only ghosting me, but this is just awful. He's old enough to be able to do what he wants, but I don't think he understands how much he's worrying his family and even me. I know he's alive because my friend's coworker saw him the one day, and I saw on a facebook post that he was obviously with his aunt on Christmas. But I don't know what to do. I'm assuming his phone is broken as well. His god father posted something to his Facebook wall, saying his dad stopped by, dropped off a phone for him, got him a job and if he takes it, he'll fix up his car for him. But how would he be able to see it? Like I said, he's old enough to legally do what he wants, he doesn't have to come home or talk to anyone if he doesn't want to but it's bothering me that his family isn't going out to get him and try to talk to him in person, atleast to my knowledge. I can be wrong. 

I don't know what to do. I don't think there's anything I can do, right? Just wait it out and see if he comes back? I'm not writing this with the intent of him coming back and us getting back together. I've come to the realization that I'm okay if we don't, and I'm not sure if I even want to anymore, but that doesn't stop me for worrying about him and wanting him to be safe and happy. I do love him.  I know he's probably running away from his problems, but in a way... this is a bit selfish."|throwawayaccount6525|False|https://redd.it/ekx152|3|1.0|0|5|1|relationship_advice
ekyv5s|2020-01-06 19:26:17|Am I (25F) being selfish or is this just life?|"Hi,

I'm not sure where to start but recently I've just started losing interest in staying friends with people. Some of whom I've been friends with for 10+ years. Most of them have children now and I'm not sure if this is why I'm becoming detached, I just feel like we don't have the same common ground anymore and everytime we do speak or see each other it's always just discussions about their children which I'm honestly not that interested about. They always expect me to reach out too as they 'have kids and are too busy to message, you have loads of free time'. When I do message or try organise something it's always 'sorry busy, can't do anything' then when we actually do speak it's just about their kids.

I just want to point out that I honestly do love them and their children. But I'm starting to think maybe I'm a terrible person for feeling like this.

Recently a few of them have been putting petty quotes on their social medias such as 'always see who your true friends are when kids come along' etc and its really starting to bug me.

Any advice/thoughts would be appreciated

ekkkau|2020-01-05 23:00:55|My (F28) boyfriend (M30) broke up with me right after an LSD trip and won't tell me why|"I'm really struggling right now due to the fact that my boyfriend just broke up with me immediately after an acid trip he did on New Years Day and won't give me a valid reason. Here's a little background on us. I've known him for nearly 2 years but we only started officially dating this previous summer. Everything in our relationship has been wonderful, we spend a lot of time together and we tell each multiple times a day how much we love each other. I've become very close to his family and they tell me how they enjoy having me around. I just spent the holidays with them all as well. It might also be worth noting he's had a broken leg for two months and all I've been doing is caring for him and being there for him and I know having a broken leg has got him down. We spent NYE together with our friends (who have also known him for almost 2 years) and everything was totally normal and fine. New Years Day in the morning was normal as well. Him and our friends decided to trip on LSD that day in our friend's apartment. I stayed sober because I didn't want to do it and that way I could help take care of anyone if they needed it. 

We were all just hanging out and listening to music that everyone seemed to be enjoying. No one was really talking and I just thought everyone was vibing and doing their own thing. At one point he did get annoyed with the music chosen and asked to change it to something else. Other than that, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. After everyone was coming down I drove us back to his place. He was silent the whole way home which he never is. Once we got to his house and in bed I leaned closer to him and he turned to me and snapped and said ""don't you dare come near me"" and I immediately broke down. I had no idea what I did to make him say that. He got a look in his eyes which was the scariest thing I've ever seen from him. I asked what was bothering him and he refused to tell me. He would just say ""you know what you did"" or ""I don't have to explain anything to you."" Eventually after enough crying the only thing I could get out of him was ""your friends are racist and you're complicit in that."" I was completely baffled when he said that. Our friends are the most loving and accepting people and no one had made any sort of comments regarding race. We literally were just listening to music all day. When I asked if he could elaborate he would just get mad and refused to go into further detail. He then said maybe he just needed a day sober to reflect and he told me we'd talk about it after he was sober. All this time he was still kind of trying comfort and calm me down by holding my hand. I had no choice but to try and fall asleep since I clearly wasn't going to get anything out of him that night in the state of mind he was in.

The next day I noticed he blocked me and our friends on social media and I again broke down because I was so confused and had no idea what was going on. When I tried reaching out to figure out what was going on he told me to delete his number and that I need to ""unblacken my heart and I'll be praying for you"" He then said he was done with me and I haven't heard from him since. I have absolutely no idea what I could have done in the span of 24 hours that would make him to do this. Everything was totally normal and fine before the trip. The most painful part is that he's refused to even talk to me and I'm completely in the dark about what happened. I'm a wreck. I can't eat, sleep, go to work and I've just been continuously crying the last few days. Something must have triggered and snapped in his trip that made him be so cruel and completely cut me off. We're supposed to love each other. How can he not explain how he's feeling and just dispose of me like I'm a piece of garbage? If he had these thoughts before and had issues with us why hadn't he brought it up before? He's not one to shy away from sharing his opinions. We had all just done Friendsgiving recently and a gift exchange for the holidays too and he told everyone how much he appreciated everyone being in his life so his behavior makes no sense.

TLDR: I'm a complete mess because my boyfriend broke up with me after doing acid a couple of days ago and won't tell me why. I'm thinking maybe he conjured up something in his mind during the trip that isn't true but he perceived it as reality. I think there's also some underlying issues that came up that he can't appropriately deal with so he made me the scapegoat. I still love him and I'm devastated that I've been left without knowing since there were no warning signs prior to this trip and refuses to explain why he's doing this. Did I so something wrong? What do I do from here? Thank you for reading."|throwawayonce55|False|https://redd.it/ekkkau|85|0.93|0|90|1|relationship_advice
el21vu|2020-01-06 23:06:26|Do I let him go through my phone?|"I semi went through his WITH him but it was mostly just his pictures. And they were from like 2010-2015, so mostly childhood pictures and old memes, with the occasional edgy teen selfie :p. We also just looked at some “private photo” apps where he had nudes from other women. He deleted those after. Then we shared which app we use to watch adult videos.

Also I jokingly said “who is she???” To his best (male) friend nick named “babe😘” in this phone. And then we both scrolled down his conversations (just the names, not the texts). I guess I felt a little insecure since he gave me an STD and I just found out today and part of me needed to know he definitely wasn’t seeing anyone. I was joking, but in hindsight I’m not sure if I overstepped? I mean he scrolled himself, I didn’t ask him.

(Also we’ve only dated 3 weeks, which is when the STD symptoms started showing. Yay).

Anyway. He has asked me a couple of times to look through my phone. Just the pictures I assume. I’ve said no and hid my phone, not cause I actually have anything to hide but... When I was a pre teen I was one of those obsessed fangirls who wrote fanfics and my camera roll was full of pictures of my idols. So it’s a habit to refuse anyone access. Also I do text ABOUT him to my friends but as far as I remember, it’s nothing negative. Would still be embarrassing if he saw though.

His ex cheated and he has dealt with a lot of jealousy. I’m afraid he’ll get paranoid when I won’t show my phone.

Should I just show him mine? Do I owe him that? Maybe delete som embarrassing / too private photos first? I have 10.000 saved... you never know. 5% of social anxiety is still left in me, and I’m afraid that it’ll pop back up if he sees an embarrassing picture... or that he’ll judge the pictures of guys I saved in like 2013.

Due to our life situation we are only able to meet during holiday times in summer and winter, cutting down our ""together"" time to about 1 1/2 months per year.

The relationship itself always had its own kind of style, we would have greater fights about smaller things, but still be happy when we get over them eventually.

Over the years we tried to come by these fights by talking more to each other about how we felt, because we realized it always helped sorting out things in the end.

Due to events about things I don't want to give further details about we have formed a great emotional binding between us, which is possibly the biggest link between us.
We went thorugh some stuff together that time and it really developed a big trust relation between us.

However, it seems like everytime we meet we get into this situation where a seemingly little thing impacts the whole relation severly, as happened today.

In this holiday period until now we've had an awesome time together, visiting different places almost every day and exploring new attractions together.

Then we have had differences in opinions about something rather small, but she wouldn't even consider my opinion, because it would contradict hers.

This led to a ""fight"" where she didn't look as she would care on how to solve it at all. All she says would be that she its her opinion and she thinks is right, thus making other opinions worthless.

I just wanted her to take my opinion seriously, while she was watching a movie instead and half-heartly answering questions so I would shut my mouth at some point.

Furthermore I don't feel like this would change because until now, whenever I had an issue and she didn't think the same way, she would rather ignore it and say its no issue at all because she doesn't understand the issue.

Feeling kinda worthless in this, thinking about giving everything up even though it hurts a lot.

Should I keep on trying or should I give it up?

I've never met my Dad, except in that short period of time (obviously I have no memory of it), but at the beginning of 2019 (May-ish) I got in touch with him for the first time ever.

I messaged him on Facebook after consulting some members of my family (My mother doesn't know. She's said I'm always welcome to contact him, so long as she has nothing to do with him). I know this isn't the best way to go about contacting someone, but I didn't know other options.

I was polite about it and left it open-ended, saying if he didn't want to reply there was no obligation. He did reply after a few days, asking what I wanted to know. We messaged back and forth for about an hour. I learned some things I wanted to find out and got some information I was oblivious to, but that's not important here.

My Father was in the British Army and was deployed to Northern Ireland during the 90's when a lot of bombings happened. He told me that he still suffers from PTSD because of this and was seeing a counsellor to help with it. Because of that, he said he wasn't in the right frame of mind, at the time, to continue speaking to me, but he did say he would be in contact when he felt better about it and said I could message any time with updates.

I left it 3 months, then sent another message, updating him on a little more about myself and what I was doing with my life.

In November I sent another, but I haven't had any replies (he has read them) since the original contact in May.

So, my question is, do I continue to try to contact him in the hopes I can get to know him or do I just leave it and get on with my life without him?

I would like to get to know him, but I'm not losing anything if there is no further contact.

Thanks in advance.

ekypwr|2020-01-06 19:16:10|I (20m) asked my old roommate (20f) to stay at her parents’ house over break and potentially ruined our friendship.|"Hello Reddit! This post is hard for me to make but I know that I need to because I am genuinely at a loss right now and becoming desperate. 

Here’s a bit of backstory:
I moved into a 3 bedroom house with 3 of my friends in 2018, 2 of them were dating at the time (I’ll call them D and G, they shared a room) and the other was my friend who I’ll call C. D and G broke up halfway through the year because G (who this post is about) went to school in the fall. We all maintained our friendships and things were always good between us. We became very close throughout our time here and it’s honestly one of the best friend groups I’ve had.

So G left in August for school, and C moved out at the end of our lease in December. Me and D were the only ones left, so we began hunting for a new roommate because we had to renew our lease and couldn’t afford to split it two ways. After a friend offered to move in and then flaked on us, my brother offered to move in. This was exciting for me because he’s very responsible and clean just like me. Everything was happening very quickly which was stressful for me, but I did my best to remain focused on keeping things in order for everyone.

Fast forward to Christmas. I went out of town to see family, and when I came back D told me that G was gonna be staying with us over break and had already moved her stuff in. She wanted to stay with us because she has a toxic situation at home and doesn’t have a great relationship with her parents (I knew this but did not understand how bad it really was yet). I realized that G had moved all of her belongings into the room I had just cleaned out for my brother (who was due to move in 3 days later), which immediately stressed me out. I told her my brother was moving in (information that D also had, but didn’t share with G) and that I wanted the room to be clean for him. She moved her things down into our living room (which was no big deal because people stay over a lot so there’s usually room anyways), but ended up having her clothes all over our dining room table. Clutter stresses me out a lot to begin with, but that same night my landlord texted me and told me that our house was going to be inspected by the city that week which is a process I’ve never gone through before. EXTRA stress. I really wanted the house to look as good as possible for the inspection, so I decided I’d ask her to stay at her parents for the rest of break. 

The next morning I came down to tell her, basically saying “hey so the city is going to inspect our house and with my brother moving in I think you should stay at your parents,” which sounded awful in hindsight but I’m garbage at communicating in situations like this. She didn’t look at me or say anything, which felt really weird, and I just kinda shut down and left to run errands. It was a very awkward interaction and even thinking about it now makes me anxious.

The next day I came downstairs, and everything was gone. She left without saying anything. D was also surprised that she left silently because he’s closer with her than I am. I texted her because my landlord needed her old key now that there would 3 of us instead of 4, and she didn’t answer. She dropped it off the next day, again, silently. I looked at our messages and realized the one about the key hadn’t sent, which was odd because she dropped it off. My heart sank as I realized she blocked my number... I knew I had messed up BAD. Our mutual friends have since all told me that she feels betrayed and that her parents house is a really, really a bad place for her. Since my number was blocked, I DMed her on Instagram apologizing for everything and saying she could move back in at any time. I felt so awful and I still do. She hasn’t said anything yet. 

I have no clue what to do now. Her friends say she needs time/space, and that I should let it go, but I know she feels like I don’t care about her because of how I asked her to leave and it’s killing me. I was really stressed about the house, but I do NOT want to lose her friendship over this situation... and I absolutely do not want her to be stuck in a toxic household. I will take any advice I can get. 

TLDR: I made my friend + old roommate stay at her parents house over break and she wants to end our friendship because of it. What do I do to make things right?"|Armadillokid|False|https://redd.it/ekypwr|2|0.75|0|1|1|relationship_advice

ekyphk|2020-01-06 19:15:20|I need help breaking up with my girlfriend|"Hey, so me (17m) and my gf (16f) have been dating for about six months. She is great and a really nice person but recently we had about a month apart and over that time I just kinda lost all my excitement for seeing her and eventually dreaded it. I have no clue why. Now  we are together again it is no different. I don't enjoy being around her and the whole relationship is a big stress. Every night when I get home my depression gets pretty bad and I just lay on my bed  and fantasize about breaking up with her.
I think part of it is our shared friends. Over time they have become more and more toxic and I never feel cared about the way I do when I'm with my friends. The culture that she and some of her friends are part of is just not for me. She is also very... Clingy. I hate to call her that but she really is. I personally need some personal space but she needs lots of touch like hugs and handholding. I have just kind of fell out of love.
But my dilemma is that I really don't want to hurt her. She is an amazing person and she deserves so much better than this. I feel so guilty. I am also almost certain that breaking up with her would make her really anxious and depressed as she had really struggled with them in the past and I think I help act as a crutch. I really don't want to hurt her. 
Do you have any advice? Is there a way to help her break up with me? What is the kindest way I can do this? Do you have any past experiences about what to do and not do? Thanks so much.

tdlr at the bottom because this got lonnnng 

about a month ago me (27) was out of town for working nightshift.. my friends, b (26) j (25) and d (23) were on a night out watching the Anthony Joshua fight.. I get a message from J about 11pm telling me how D kicked off in the bar and caused a riot resulting in multiple people getting hurt and a TV getting smashed. This kicked off because D saw B telling a guy to fuck off and B walked away D took it upon herself to ""defend"" B and burst the wrong guys nose. She then stormed out, threw a glass bottle at B's feet leaving glass in her legs, who was outside trying to avoid any drama. I then phoned D to see what was going on, I got nothing but shitty attitude from someone who could barely string a sentence together. Spoke with J and B who said that D had tried to start a fight with both of them multiple times throughout the night and had generally just came out in a bad mood and was taking it out on everyone, this isn't new but has never been at this scale.. the night finishes J and B go home D gets in a taxi thats going to the town she's from. Instead of going home she gets dropped off at the pub her car was left at earlier, decided to drive back to see B because she felt that B was upset, B told her she was going to bed and was fine. D drove anyways, blind drunk, wrote her car off in a ditch. B phoned me 3am asking wtf to do and she was beyond angry at D. D phoned her mum who came got her out the car and took her home before the police found her.

OK, so that's the night that caused me to fall out with D. She asked B at the time not to tell me, knowing I wouldn't be happy. The next day she didn't get in touch with J or B with an apology or explanation as to why she was so upset. She still hasn't sincerely done this. She went completely silent and played the woe is me card. The guy she hit didn't press charges and the police called her once the car was reported as abandoned in a ditch and asked her to pay to repair the farmers fence (they had no idea or evidence she had been drunk driving) her family bought her a new car (she needs it for work) and she more or less got away with it.

about a week later she reappears in the groupchats (I'm still away, she still has no idea I know anything) I'm not fake and can't pretend I'm not pissed at someone when I am so I sent her a message as to why I was pissed and if she took responsibility for it and apoligised I'd be cool. She states she can't remember the night and ""can't change what's done now anyways"". She told me she understands and respects my view on the whole situation but hasn't attempted to fix it. J is a soft touch and let's people walk over her so they're speaking B is tougher but is going through it just now and could use her best mate I'm still furious with her and her lack of effort, she came out with us new years eve (sober) and didn't think to speak about it then, it's now got very stale and awkward if she's spoken about.

I don't want to forgive her until she owns it and is geniuenly sorry but I also feel like for the sake of the rest of the group I might have to as they're moving towards just forgetting about it

el1wuw|2020-01-06 22:56:25|Me (16F) my boyfriend (16M) and his friend (18F)|"My boyfriend and I have been together for two years and have known each other for all our lives. Recently we've gone on a break and he's told me about the dilemma he's had. He's been good friends with another girl for around a year and they've spend time together when they can. They seem so happy so I'm okay with it. The girl was in a relationship with her boyfriend of many years but his behavior began to get increasingly negative and my boyfriend has helped her through it. Thankfully they broke up a week after we had gone on our break.

Today my boyfriend told me how 7 months ago he realized the hints she's been giving him and then they never really spoken about it until now. Their previous hangouts, during our relationship, were platonic and I believe him. The last few, on our break, were getting more romantic. Enough where he may have gotten a hickey. Me and him and talked about this and his dilemma, about how these feelings did lead to their breakup but wasn't ultimately the cause.

I don't hold any ill on the girl, in fact I can see how much they care about each other. What led to our break wasn't anything bad, we had stopped hanging out as much due to finals and many bad things happened to him. We've discussed how we still care about each other, and I've talked about how I can do better to be a better person for him. The cause for our break was that he didn't feel the same anymore.

When I've asked about what he wants to do, he says he doesn't know as this happened only recently. We have talked about breaks before, and he wanted to make it clear that breaks are good to venture onto other options and eventually I was persuaded. He's told me he's afraid that I've settled down too quickly. Now, I've been telling him how I want him to be happy even if I still want to get back together. That I want him to choose not based on my feelings or hers, on rather what will make him happy. When I bring up that maybe we should then break up, he doesn't seem like he wants to do that. Rather he says he wants our relationship to still be up on the table, so that if we ever did want to get back together we could. From what I can see, we both still harbor feelings for each other.

I know he likes her in some way, as she advanced on him and he let it happen. I know they care for each other and she likes him. When he's been telling me about it, he smiles. When I asked beforehand what was up he told me ""It's not a bad thing, it's fantastic."" But when I ask him if they're dating he tells me that not really and that he doesn't know. I want both of them to be happy, but it seems like he doesn't want to choose out of respect for both of us. In the end it is up to him, but I wanted to talk about this and what some of you guys thought, maybe what i can do to make this easier for him, because after everything we still want to be apart of each other's lives."|Fehkoala911|False|https://redd.it/el1wuw|0|0.5|0|0|1|relationship_advice
el1wgn|2020-01-06 22:55:39|How do I (25F) explain to my wealthy friend (26F) that I cannot afford to hang out with her?|"Location USA/West coast. I have a friend with a fairly lucrative job earning what I assume is a lucrative amount of money. I do fairly well for myself but am by no means wealthy. She and I have been friends for several years. She is always inviting me to extravagant places - spontaneous weekend trips to a nearby city for some exciting event, weekend getaways for some festival or resort, and so on. Often they are spur of the moment with only a few days' notice in advance. I am also an introvert and don't do well with big plans if I don't have a good amount of notice.

Most of the time I simply have to say no. When I do decline, I give a reason - either I'm busy that day/weekend, or the money isn't in my budget. But she keeps inviting me (along with a group of friends). I'm 100% sure it's not malicious and she genuinely wants to hang out, and probably doesn't realize that I can't just drop the rest of my plans to commit to an entire weekend at a beach house two hours away, or that my budget doesn't allow me to spend hundreds of dollars on a whim.

I'm sure this must be coming off as me not wanting to hang out with her. I say no the majority of the time she invites me out, but when we do get together for more casual events like dinners, drink, or a movie I have a ton of fun. How do I communicate to her that these are more my styles of events, and that me frequently saying no is more of a difficulty keeping up with her lifestyle rather than not wanting to hang out with her? She lives over an hour away from me so it is not easy to get together on a regular basis.

TL;DR: Wealthy friend regularly invites me to expensive and commitment-heavy outings on a whim and I typically decline; how do I explain this while still remaining her friend?"|ThrowRAfinerthings|False|https://redd.it/el1wgn|1|1.0|0|4|1|relationship_advice

el1ur9|2020-01-06 22:52:19|I [F14] dont know how to break up with my first boyfriend because I have realized I’m not ready for a relationship but I have a problem with confrontation|"Let's start in the beginning, I have had bad experiences with relationships beyond platonic, both sexual and romantic. I won't get into all the gory details of my oh-so-tragic past but i will say this, it involves a hood bit of trauma and has caused me to really not believe I could be in a romantic relationships, and made me not want one. Along the way I have had many faux-crushes or people I thought I liked and realized I didn't. So I have never been in a relationship, in fact I avoided them for years.

Here we are, I got a boyfriend. Now this boy is very fast paced, and touchy. As in the holds, my thigh and has told me he loved me within the first week of dating. Now I may be young but I know that ain't right, he doesn't love me, he can't. And I realized he was likely a faux-crush I rushed into without fully understanding. That is only part of why I need to break up with him though. Partially is because I realized physical affection beyond platonic still freaks me out and so does liking people and putting that kind of faith in them. It activates my flight or fight response and pushes me away. It takes a big toll on my mental health. Now I know a relationship is what will help this, but he isn't my tool of self-improvement nor would he be the right person for that. So for my own mental health, and his as well as I am far from what he deserves in a relationship (as I said pushes me away. I get distant with him, he doesn't deserve that) I need to break up with him but there is the problem, i don't know how.

I'm not good with confrontation or speaking my emotions at all, as I completely lock up and 80% of the time I don't end up saying what I wanted to. I don't want to mess this up. I also feel like he deserves an explanation of why, so he knows it wasn't him and to try and save our friendship, and I also don't want to say that, especially in front of others, but we're never alone.

el1u5t|2020-01-06 22:51:08|(ThrowRA) I(17F) regret ending my friendship with my ex-best friend(17F) LONG STORY|"In September of 2018, I started my Junior year of High School and I was excited to see my friend (let's call her A). During the first week, A wasn't talking to me. I got upset and a whole fight that I caused went down. Turns out A got confused why I wasn't talking to her and I confused why she wasn't talking to me. I later got mad because I remembered the end of our sophomore year, A got together with a guy who I don't like and I felt like he was changing her in ways I wasn't used to seeing her as. I then did the worst thing of my life and instead of talking to A about it, I tried to end things. I sent a text to end things but A took the tone differently than I meant it to be and she couldn't see me the same person. I've realized later why it hurt A in the way it did and how she couldn't see me the same. I should've just never sent the text and fixed things. I later apologized for it but I don't think I took into consideration what I was doing and how much damage I did to A and just tried to defend my side because I was stubborn. It led to A not being my friend again and I had to respect that.

I later realized the summer of 2019 that causing that whole fight was my biggest regret and it haunts me now. I often remember my dreams and the only person who tended to show up the most (about 90%) in the span of a year was A. I looked it up and it signals that I missed A and honestly I do because we had really good memories and she helped me on some things in the past I'm not proud of. I realized why she was changing that previous summer because I felt the exact same way and I don't think it was her boyfriend's fault, he was just shaping her into she is now. I got some friends that helped me out after the fight and I got my driver's license and all of us just wanted to explore cities and just have fun being a teen. I really loved going out and not staying in all day playing video games and I see why she felt suffocated. I started wearing new clothing and changing my mindset to positive thinking and I became happier which led me to what others say about me is that I'm ""kind and wholesome"" today.  In the middle of that summer, I was breaking things off with my now online ex-boyfriend of almost 3 years due to me growing up and wanting to be out more and I messaged A saying I needed her because I didn't know if I was making the right choice on breaking things off with him or not and I said I was sorry for what I did. She never replied and I saw her the next day at a city carnival which meant she ignored my text on purpose. I honestly deserved it and I know that.

I've changed a lot that summer and I really reflected on it the previous year. I went back to school for my senior year and it all hit me quite hard. I saw A and her boyfriend a lot in the hallways and I tried not to look A because I'm really sorry at what I did to her and it makes me really anxious. I realized in the past month since I caused a huge fight with A a year ago, I doubt myself very severely and I have a fear of hurting people due to what I did to A. This past Christmas break I broke down and wrote on the notes of my phone on how sorry I was and how much I finally understand and realized. I really want to tell A how I feel but I don't think I can because I tried messaging her once already during the summer. I'm not sure if I should just get over her because I deserve not to be friends with A or I should keep waiting and see if she would ever come back because I have hope she'll one day say she would like to talk.

I'm sorry I'm throwing on such a huge story onto people, I just need an outsider's point of view to give me some advice and guidance on what to do or how to move on because I just can't. She means the world to me and I just want to do what's not only best for me but for her so I don't make her be friends with me because I apologized and she doesn't know how to say she doesn't want to be my friend or hates me. Also sorry if my grammar is bad or something doesn't make sense!! please let me know so I can clarify anything or answer questions!!"|slurpeeequeeen|False|https://redd.it/el1u5t|1|1.0|0|0|1|relationship_advice

He has lead me into the impression that we are to be together but I just need some growth during our time apart. 

Sometimes I randomly trigger him I don't know what the next thing I will say or do that will make him block me. 

Ex. Today I sent a embarassing message it's not that bad but he sent reaction images and it made me feel even more embarassed and he said it's good to laugh at yourself it shows humility 

Next thing : he sent me a selfie and I told him what a nice looking man ect. 

He said thank you I do try 

And I said "" not hard enough ""

However I was just teasing him but I didn't portray that because I didn't use any emojis ? And then I told him 

"" Ah you can't laugh at yourself either ravioli ? ""

But I didn't mean to make it look like I was being petty back but it sure looks that way now I'm really good at saying the wrong things at the wrong time 

And I realized and I apologized prefusley

And I called him lots 

And everything just lined up so terribly 

But this isn't the first time he's blocking me 
I know it doesn't matter if I have a gentle heart or I'm just genuinely that dumb but 
It hurts a lot that I'm always chasing him 
And having to apologize and I feel like a nervous wreck at times when stuff like this happens 
Because it's like I'm always putting him on an edge someway or another. 

What's worse is when we were together we always bullied one another and I notice when he bullies me and pushes it too far I'm never anal about it I know his true intentions and I know he is very sorry

But whenever I push it even a bit at the wrong time 
He always has me begging forgiveness and making me chase after him and it's exhuasting and makes me cry and feel so dumb.

Before I met her I would volunteer a lot to boys and girls club a pee wee football team and at my old high school. (All the volunteering would be for coaching football or track and field) I enjoy it, it kept me busy and my parents loved seeing it. I started slowly moving away from it sense we started dating but I miss it. I miss the feeling of accomplishment and staying busy. So I told her 
Me: I wanna start volunteering again (I list want I wanted to do)
She got very sad she saw it as me trying to push her away from me and not spending as much time with her. I told her I will still find the time to be with her but i would have to balance a lot with School, Gym, coaching, and work.
I don't know what to do she almost heartbroken because I want to do these things

One time we discussed about one girl he kept chatting with. Before beginning our relationship, he sent photos of her dick and she sent back photos of her ass. 
I understand we weren’t together when that happened, but he kept chatting with her, I found out about that checking his phone: They were talking about relationships and threesomes and at the end he writes her: “it’s a pity that I have a girlfriend or I will have a threesome with you and your boyfriend”.

He also used to chat with another girl and I got pissed off because in previous chats he had told her she had such a nice ass and he would pay for her breast operation and they will marry each other (this was also before starting our relationship).

But even when we started our relationship he kept chatting with her as friends. One time, he answered one of her whatsapp status in which she showed her cleavage and he asked her: “Did you get operated?” 

In my opinion he is an scumbag because of that, but I also have strong feelings for him. 

And lastly, he has this female friend. He moved back from another city to start a relationship with me, that was beautiful. But it didn’t pass 24 hours since he arrived to the city when I called him because we had planned to meet that night and he told me he was having coffee with her. I got even more pissed off because he arrived late to our date that night.

From that moment I don’t like her but the worse was in her birthday, because she invited him but not me. He did not go but from that day I do not accept her having contact with my bf.

I don’t feel comfortable with that friendship of my boyfriend and I have told him I want to break up with him.

el1t2y|2020-01-06 22:49:08|My (30m) girlfriend (29f) mentioned a retaliation hook up after a past breakup. Is this a red flag?|"I have been seeing my girlfriend for about 9 months and on all accounts everything is going well. We have similar values, goals and are generally very compatible.





But a few days ago she mentioned something that didn't really register at the time and I am now wondering whether it is a red flag.





When her and an ex boyfriend split up (early 20's) she said she went out and hooked up with one of their mutual friends immediately to 'get back at him' and made sure he found out. He hadn't cheated or anything, it was just a case of being incompatible.





I appreciate she was younger then but it just seems like a casual and almost mocking approach to a spiteful act. It's not at all in concert with the person I think I know.





In general we are very sex positive, but now I am thinking, would she use sex as a weapon? Is she that kind of person and I just haven't noticed?





We haven't discussed sexual history in any great detail and I am now wondering what else there is that I don't know. 





I made a post a few weeks ago because I felt like there were some communication boundaries being put up in that area which may be linked to past experiences but the consensus was that it was none of my business and I was upon reflection inclined to agree.





How would you deal with this?





I don't want it to become something larger than it is, it was several years ago and doesn't match her personality now, but in hindsight there has definitely been a lack of communication on sexual history compared to what 'normally' comes up by this point and I am wondering whether there is a reason for that.  Body count and experiences certainly don't constitute a deal breaker, but malicious behaviour is a definite red flag for me."|gluten-free-nihilism|False|https://redd.it/el1t2y|1|1.0|0|8|1|relationship_advice

My gf was really on board for a good while until I started talking about it more seriously.

I've been through all the details and reassured her that there should be no issues. After every conversation she very confidently seems to be on board with it....until the next day she tells me that she's worried or concerned about taking the step. I'm trying to be supportive and understand her issues but there doesnt seem to actually be any other than this. 

What I dont understand is that she hates her job and where we live is boring and has little opportunity (currently living with my parents). 

I try to express that this would be a good thing to do while were young and have no commitments. For reference my girlfriend does suffer with severe anxiety and emotional issues despite being an overall very confident and extroverted person when meeting new people. 

So my question is, are there any ways on how I could bring her around? I do love her but her indecisiveness and unwilling to do anything spontaneous is driving a wedge through our relationship. 

I hope this doesnt come across too dickish on my end, I am trying to be reasonable about the sitaution but I'm worried that we simply want different things in life.

The last thing I said to her was ‘you won’t hear from me again.’ The reason I said this is because that was the only way I could heal from the breakup. She agreed and said I wouldn’t hear from her either. 

She messaged me a few days ago after 5 months and we spoke on the phone for some time. She said that she thinks we are on good terms which confused me. 

Deep down I’ve been dying to speak to her for months to apologise for all of the things I did wrong but based on the fact I said I wouldn’t speak to her again I didn’t and I was slowly getting over her. I believed that she would never give me the opportunity to make it up to her so I just sort of accepted it. 

The fact she messaged me has opened up the feelings again just when I was doing good. 

A part of me just wants to be honest with her and tell her how shitty I feel about what I did but another part of me says that if I do that she may  get scared and just cut off contact again. 

In two minds here. Be bold and say what’s on my mind or play it cool and see what happens. The upside for being bold is getting this off my chest and potentially getting her back. The downside is losing her forever.

We've been friends since fall 2017. We love each other deeply. We want to end up with each other. However, our differences about the future are causing a rift between us. He's in the military and will be so for another 5 years. I'm about to finish up undergrad, take a gap year, and then apply to medical school. When I ask him about what he'll do after the 5 years of the military, he says he does not know if he'll re-enlist or get out. I told him, I'll help him figure out what he wants, but he has been saying idk for months. I want him to get out because I've seen that the army has made him unhappy, but he claims he doesn't hate it and he doesn't have a plan B. I want him to get out because I want to start a family, settle down in one place, and not have a partner whose career isn't plagued with stress and deployments. When I ask him what he wants in life, he says he wants me. 

At this point, we don't know if we should stay together or end it. I want him to have a plan, or at least a tentative one. I don't want to sound selfish, but I deserve that so I can see some clarity.

el1s5b|2020-01-06 22:47:14|I’ve known him for almost a decade, keeps coming back into my life.|"Obviously I’m not asking for sugarcoated advice, so please tell me like how it is because I really need some help getting over this entire situation. 
I’ve known this guy, let’s call him “T” for almost a decade. Met in hs, he admitted he had a crush on me back then but never actually came forward about it. Fast forward, I got into a relationship with someone and we had a kid. Keep in mind that before this all happened, T and I had casually dated. I was impatient back then and just decided to go back to my ex. I cut off all contact with T back then. 
My ex and I ended things last year and T started talking to me again. Things fizzled out and he told me that it wouldn’t work out because his parents, coming from an Asian background, wouldn’t approve due to the fact that I have a kid. Also saying how “if I really loved him then I wouldn’t have left for another man and started a whole new life with him”. We stopped talking for awhile... I got over it. Then he pops up. AGAIN. I had no interest and when he would invite me out, I would sorta blow him off. He confronted me saying if he should be worried, if he should stop making effort to invite me out. Which, I honestly do not understand, if he doesn’t see a future with me. 

I started talking more to him. We would hang out sometimes, have sex, cuddle. He would talk to me as if we’re in a relationship, calling me “baby” stuff like that. We spent New Years together and when it was midnight, he said I love you and we kissed. 

After that, I was very confused. Why was he sending me all these mixed signals if he said what he did almost a year ago? This is what he told me: 

“We’ve had convos stating it was never going to work out, but we still see each other and that’s where it gets messy. I don’t want to grow feelings for you because I know I’d just get hurt in the end. So will you. Saying that I loved you on New Years was probably one of my last to you. I don’t want you to fall for me just to end up getting hurt because right now is not the time for me. And I’m not ready for a relationship. And I apologize for making sure I’m ready before diving into any of this. When I said those things, I meant it, but every time I did, I felt bad because I couldn’t do anything with my feelings. I can’t have a relationship and I don’t know when I’ll be ready.” And I asked him “so why even say that you loved me?” 
He said “I genuinely felt that way so I said that it but immediately after, I felt like I shouldn’t have and that’s my mistake. I felt the false hope for us but every time I did, I told myself it wasn’t going to happen. I’m sorry”. 

We didn’t end things on bad terms. But I’ve never been so confused.. did he just play me like a fool? Did he actually love me but he just can’t bring himself to have a relationship with me since I have a child? Why does he keep coming back then? I feel like the answers are right in my face, haha but I need someone to tell me so I can get my emotions straight."|XJewlsx97|False|https://redd.it/el1s5b|1|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice

Let me start off my saying, I’m skinny for my weight. The last time I weighed myself I was around 125 pounds, and I stand around 6 foot even. I’m not bulky, I don’t really look like I could protect anyone, and my friends are all decently bigger than me, even ones that are younger.  No matter what I do, I can’t gain weight, although I eat constantly and work out.

I always thought of myself as easy to get along with and semi fun to be around, but it just doesn’t seem to be the case anymore. It really makes me want to give up trying to introduce myself to new people, because I know I won’t talk to them after a weeks time. 

I have mild acne, and people used to compliment my jawline, but I feel like people stopped caring when they realized I was just skinny. In the past four months I’ve only been able to talk to two girls outside of my family, and they quickly ghosted me. Tried tinder for half a month, no matches.

el1rux|2020-01-06 22:46:37|Should I confess to my online crush after what’s happened?|"There’s this girl I’ve known for more than 2 years now, I know her from the internet so it’s kind of hard to explain this. We got to know each other in a random app where we talked pretty much everytime. I felt that we had a lot in common and had the same opinions about a lot of stuff. At first I just saw her as another online friend but as time passed I started having a little crush on her. She was the one who made me feel something I had never felt before for the first time. We slowly started talking even more everyday and then we even got in a sort of secret relationship that only a few people knew about. Basically I confessed to her and she said she liked me back. We were childish, weird and playful together and while it lasted, it was one of the best moments I’ve experienced in my life. I hate myself for doing this but me being a stupid teen who had never been in a relationship before got sceptical about it because of the distance and decided to stop talking to her. 

I couldn’t last a long time without talking to her so after 4-5 months I tried to fix our broken relationship. I didn’t expect it to work out but it did, we have started talking again since last year. The only thing that changed is that we started our relationship as friends again. I thought the time we spent seperated from each other would get rid of the feelings we had but I feel like both of us have the same feelings for each other again but I’m too scared/shy to confess. I mean I definitely still do have feelings for her but I’m not sure about her, I feel like she’s trying to give hints to me but I don’t know?? I spend a lot of time daydreaming about her and sometimes I have these feelings at night that make me feel so restless..At first I thought this online thing wouldn’t really work out but from all the time I spent with her I can tell that I found a really worthy person to care for. It’s really hard for me to still confess after my hasty decision in the past of leaving her because I don’t know what she still feels about it. So I’m here to ask if I should confess or not


Notes: Yes, I do know that she is not an 67 year old man living in his basement 

-People have told me that it was a stupid decision to leave her. I know that, I left her knowing that and thinking that she’d be happier without me and would find someone better outside the internet. Looking back at it now it was just my past self trying to make something going perfectly fine seem bad.

After making a remark that I was the only person she'd leave her boyfriend for, he dumped her. We hang out several times a week and last month we came really close to kissing, but we were out with another friend. We almost hooked up about a week after that but nothing ever actually happened. A few days ago I was joking around with our friend group (her included) that I was crushing on someone in our group. She was surprised and went on to say she ""definitely wouldn't be mad if it was her"" and then eventually elaborated that she didn't have feelings for me, but used to within the past few months. I told her that I actually did have feelings for her, aside from the joke and she said, ""oh yeah, definitely not mad about that"". This was all via text so I'm worried as to how things will be when I see her tomorrow, and wbu she felt the need to bring up past feelings.

I thought they were both kinda cute at first, I was talking to them both for a bit, but then rumors started to go around that they were gonna fight after lunch last Friday. Stuff like that happens often enough at my school, it's kind of trashy tbh

I told my friends that they were both total dumbasses, if either of them knew me at all they'd know that a bad temper or anger is my number one turn off. I don't have any patience for anyone who can't resolve things like an adult. I've dealt too much with bad tempers in my own family and I have no more patience for it.

Anyway, they went at it on Friday. And I stayed the hell out of it. I told my friends that I didn't have time for dumb childish shit like that and I was done with them both. I was going to spend the weekend studying for the ACT test and if anyone hit me up I'd have my phone off

After all that they're both suspended from school and the gossip had gotten around that it was about me. But the gossip got nastier,a lot of people are saying I led them on, I goaded them into it by ""dating"" them both, I knew what they were gonna do and didn't do a thing to stop it. One girl who's friends with one of them is mad that I got him suspended

I said that they got themselves in trouble for acting like children. And that made a lot of people more upset.

I also was asked by a school counselor to tell them what had gone on and I said I hadn't been there, I didn't care what games they were playing and I didn't have or want any part in it

Nothing huge, but things like leaving food in the sink, pots and pans left unwashed for a couple of days, crumbs all over the kitchen counter. 

It bothers myself and the rest of the house (there's six of us in total) but we are all pretty easy going so just let it slide and have never said anything to her.

I wanted to work from home one day and she had left a pile of sweet wrappers and a few empty alcohol cans on our table. Im the kind of person who needs a neat and clean desk in order to feel like I can settle down and do some work - it annoyed me that she had left it for someone else to clean and I don't really like cleaning up after other people. I text in our group chat ""@xxx can you please stop repeatedly leaving mess in the living room, I wanted to work from home today and it's not very nice"" - to this she replied with a paragraph about why my text was unjustified, she said she was too busy and also said that it was bitterly ironic that I would ask her to clean the wrappers up seeing as it was sweets she had bought for the whole house to share.

This reaaaally bothered me as I this was the first time in 8 months of living there I had ever asked her to clean her mess, and she replied with an attitude. I think, as I am typically easy going, she thought I would just take it. 

Anyway, I sent her a message back listing all the other irritating habits she has i.e. leaving the rest of the house to empty the bins, never clearing the dishwasher, being loud in the mornings etc - I asked if the reason she did all this was also because she was too busy or whether it was just because she was selfish.

She said that we should talk about this in person tonight. I told her that I had no interest in talking to someone who dismissed my opinions and that I didn't want to talk to her. I feel pretty childish for this but I was really annoyed and I suck at this sort of thing - she's not the sort of person who can accept any blame so I knew I'd just end up getting angry. 

For the last couple of weeks I have ignored her but obviously this is difficult when you live with someone. She is starting to say Hi when we see eachother, and she asks how my day was - I feel bad but I am very cold in my response. I guess she wants to pretend like nothing has happened but it's hard for me to just flip a switch back to that again. 

I want to address this issue as it's gone on too long but I'm not sure what to say to her. 

Tldr - told housemate to clean mess and she told me I was unjustified to ask that of her.

An issue that has always been there but now is getting out of hand is that I can't talk to her about any issues with her interpreting it as an attack and trying to make a fight out of it. As an example I woke up today and was feeling low and insecure, I told her and started talking about honesty. I asked her if something specific had happened and if maybe she was just not telling me to spare my feelings, and she responded with ""I wouldn't bother sparing your feelings because you hurt me when you did x thing in the past"". When I told her that was a hurtful thing to say she blew up, attacked my flaws, went off about every bad thing she had been through throughout her life, threw f-bombs left and right, said that she wants to slit her wrists whenever she comes home, and hinted that she might move out.

My biggest thing here is I want to be supportive, but also it seems kind of manipulative to bring up ""I was raped when I was 12"" in a conversation that has nothing to do with that then to threaten moving out. So I don't really do how to respond to that since it's hard to say ""I'm sorry that happened to you, it's not your fault, and you can talk to me"" and ""it's not fair for you to bring stuff like that up in this situation"" together especially since I know that she'll hear it as ""I don't want to hear about that, stop bringing it up"".

Basically I broke up with her because she got cold feet after really pressuring for the engagement. After a long time of me trying to get through to her, get her to see a therapist, communicate, or make things better, I was unhappy doing all the work and not getting any effort back from her and ended things. 

It was like one of those situations where you're a depressed persons ""lifejacket"" and they're pulling you down.. I don't think either of us was consistently happy after the engagement because she didn't want it like she had said and felt pressured even though she didn't really say that or try to work through it with me as a team. It was a rollercoaster and she wasn't there for me.

During the cold feet time she also had an innocent crush on a coworker friend for most of it and when I found out it was textbook emotional cheating based off her actions. I reached out to her and she just wasn't there for me and I realized I felt that way a decent amount since the cold feet happened. I was the one carrying the relationship and trying to fix all the things.

Anyways, I went no contact after initiating the breakup this fall and deleted or blocked her on everything. I recovered and moved on. I talked to a therapist for a bit, don't really think of her anymore, and I've been on 15-20ish dates. I am interested in getting to know 2 of them more, restarted old hobbies and new ones, started getting out more socially or by myself for fun, but this hit out of the blue. She bought a membership to a dating app just to send me the message she wants to meet for coffee. 

I asked why she contacted me despite my wishes she not and she said her reasons were that she have been dating around too and ""none of them are as good as what we had when we were happy. I can't connect with them. Sorry I know I am being selfish given all that's happened.""

Something possessed me to say ""if you've changed or grown and came to an important realization, I'd be willing to hear you out over coffee."" 

So we're probably having a coffee Saturday. In my heart, I don't think she sincerely grew or worked on negative parts of herself as I asked a couple questions about her life now. I just don't know really what to say or ask her besides probe for what she's done to work on herself or would do different if I gave her a chance at any kind of contact or casual dating while I casually see other people too. 

I don't think it will go anywhere, but I am big on listening to someone if they have something to say and I want to avoid common mistakes or pitfalls.

I was always put in the back of school pictures because I was always the tallest, well I ended at 5'9 and while it's not ***too*** tall im still not short. Let's add also that im obese and I've always been the fat girl. I've also always been the ""You're so pretty in the face"" girl, yeah that one gets old. I've gone through eating disorders, drug addictions and I've been ""thin"" but I went about it the wrong way. From my thinnest im about 80 pounds heavier but not obsessed with losing it, I won't allow myself to do it because it'll turn me into a calorie carb counting crazy person. At the moment im between a size 16-18 depending on the brand. Im still not at the biggest I've been before (size 22). I've never thought of myself as ugly and I've never had issues in the relationship department but as I've gotten older I've realized I was only seen as a fetish and not ever genuinely liked for me. In my previous relationship he would call me beautiful everyday or tell me I looked nice, later I found out all that was a cover-up for his cheating but that's another shit show I won't get into.

Now, my current dilemma. My current bf is average size and before life got in the way he was into fitness and all that,  he still is but not as much as I know hed like to have time for. I always knew but I confirmed a couple of weeks ago, I have been the biggest woman he has ever been with. This shouldn't matter, right? He's with me for good reasons and I know he loves me but how do I get over when I've seen women he's dated before me? Thin women, feminine women, how am I supposed to just think that he's attracted to me the same? He's not the biggest complimenter and he's more about showing you he loves you but am I wrong for wanting to hear it sometimes?  I've tried explaining this to him but he just assures me there's nothing wrong with me.  This doesn't make me unhappy with him and he doesn't make me feel ugly or anything but how do I get over this dumb insecurity? People stare at us, we're already an interracial couple and that one gets us the stares but its also a fat girl with an attractive guy and the stares or snark comments drive me insane. He's never heard them but I have and its always from older pissed off women but nonetheless the comments get annoying.

el1mqm|2020-01-06 22:36:34|Please help translate this from Spanish/Catalan if you can and give me some insight. Is it micro cheating or more? (29m) (26f)|"mods, I’m not sure if this is the place but I really need help from the community to translate this. Anyways, my wife (26f) had this text exchange between her and a male co worker who is also engaged. Her and I have been together for 3 years. My friends say it’s aweird exchange. 

Her and I had a bit of a rough patch but we have resolved things and have been better. Am I looking too much into it or is this crossing the very flirty line? I don’t have any previous context to the chat other than she splurged on a Michale Kors purse and I helped by the wallet the other day. She was also sick this morning which is why he asks how she’s feeling. 

I’ve also noticed selfie exchanges over the holidays and yes, u have mentioned it twice. She got very defensive and starting hiding her phone when they messaged and would put it on DND. Also had seen a fire emoji in reply to a selfie exchange that took place on Christmas Day. 

She states they’re just good friends at work and he’s engaged and he talks to all the girls. I’ve never met him and can’t cause I don’t speak Catalan and very little Spanish. 

TLDR: I suspect my wife of 3 years of possibly micro cheating with a co worker after noticing how often they text and some of the exchanges. I have posted a pic of a text exchange and need help translating and taking the meaning from it."|LaunchingLemur|False|https://redd.it/el1mqm|1|1.0|0|7|1|relationship_advice

Turns out he isn’t sleeping. Not like the classic high school “yeah bro you think 6 hours is bad? I get NONE”, but he literally doesn’t sleep at all most nights. 
I made a deal with him. If we stayed after school and did our homework in the library then he would get sleep, since he told me the reason he stays up late to do homework. 

So come the next day  and we meet after school in the library. We did homework, he finished, we fucked around for a bit, and I asked him if he’d sleep tonight. All I get is a “probably not” and he sends me a picture of a grilled cheese at 3 am. I’m really worried about him as it seems to be really contributing to depression and worse grades and REALLY heightened anxiety (hands shaking and shit).

el1lwg|2020-01-06 22:34:59|Need advice on getting over someone you have to see everyday|"Title says most of it, I think. 

My girlfriend (22f) and I (22m) both go to the same graduate school, in the same program. We don’t have classes together, but there are only ~200 people in the whole class, and it’s all in one building, so I have to see her every day. 

On top of that, we share a lot of the same friends, like *a lot* of the same friends who have staunchly not chosen a “side” but hang out with my ex more often because they have more classes together. 

We broke up *really* recently, and everyone’s been telling me they’re shocked we broke up, and shocked that both of us, at least to a certain degree, seem fine. I don’t know about her, but I’m not okay and have just been putting a face on.

Our friends have asked me to hang out with them regardless, and I don’t want to lose them as friends, I just don’t think I can be near my ex and get over her at the same time. This girl and I have broken up 4 times and only really this time have we taken steps to *be* broken up, and I think it’s time I get over her, because she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be with me. 

Really, I’m just looking for advice on how much I really should be avoiding her, and if there’s any way y’all could suggest things for me to do or say to myself that would help me not spiral every time I see her (which I did today—had to go sit on the toilet and cry for a minute just because I saw her).

I can’t get her out of my head. Part of me is glad we broke up, it was an unhealthy relationship in some ways... but I miss her, and these intrusive thoughts of how she’s feeling or what she’s doing now that she’s single are really getting to me. 

Sorry this has turned into more of a rant... but any advice beyond the simple and easier-said-than-done “get over her” would be really helpful."|antimutable|False|https://redd.it/el1lwg|1|1.0|0|0|1|relationship_advice

Wake up, work 7 until 7, come home, eat, go to bed. That is my life, day in, day out. And I do this just to support them, otherwise I'd probably get away with 8 hour days like normal people. But no, daughter wants a new console, wife wants expensive clothes, gotta pay for my piece of shit car to taxi them around constantly. I get zero fucking time to myself, ever. Writing this post is probably the only time I've had to myself since our daughter was born and that's only because my wife's mother is sick so they're staying with her tonight so they can spend some time with her before she passes.


I've spoken to a couple of people about my struggles and both of them were quick to jump in and tell me that they ""have to come first, blah blah blah"". But what about me? Am I not allowed to be happy? Am I not allowed to be frustrated? I'm just expected to be an emotionally muted working machine just to support a daughter I never wanted to begin with. I fucking hate children and everyone who knows me knows this.

Firstly I don’t want to talk bad about my husband because I love him so much but I’m really lost and need advice.
6 years ago I had an affair with someone that was the biggest biggest regret of my life. Me and my husband had totally drifted apart and I was suffering with Post natal depression. I neglected my husband and baby boy and went out every weekend looking for attention from this guy. He made me feel like I mattered and that I was something special and that feeling was totally addictive. One night we ended up sleeping together and it was so horrible I just felt numb. However after the fact I still wanted this guy to fancy and pursue me. A lot of people knew what had happened abd stories were going around until I eventually had to come clean to my husband. Over the corse of 2 years I only revealed parts of what happened hoping it would appease him but he always knew there was more. Eventually I told him that I had actually slept with this guy.

Since finding out this has totally totally destroyed him. He’s been suicidal at times and it’s changed the person he used to be.
He gets periods of extreme low mood abd other times he is extremely extremely abusive.
I’ve been spat at, called the worst babe imaginable and also there have been a few occasions where he’s dragged me by my head into a kitchen cupboard abd also been held by my neck abd kicked out of the house in front of our son. This has been happening for 4 years abd I’ve taken it all abd constantly keep begging for him to forgive me 

I have been so incredibly sad for so many years now but I stay because I love him so much.

Recently I’ve also found out that he’s had an emotional affair wgere they were sending each other naked photos. He’s extremely remorseful but says it’s only happened because of what I’ve done.

It’s hit me for 6 abd I feel so so guilty for what I did now even more then before.

I’ve had an emotional breakdown since he was violent with me a few weeks ago abd this was not long after I’ve found out about his affair

el1knj|2020-01-06 22:32:38|Should I (25m) make a move on my friend (24f)?|"Yes this is one of those posts. I'm sorry, alright, but I need to get some advice about this that is outwith of my immediate friends and I also need to have a place to put it down and get my head in the right area. 

I (25m) met this girl (24f) who I'm going to call Lisa for the sake of this post around 10 months ago. I moved back to the city I live in now and she was friends with an old friend of mine's girlfriend (both of whom I knew at University). We met, we get on, we're both single, that is great. Now, I'm no looker. I'm overweight, i don't take great care of myself when it comes to looks and I have never really cared and Lisa is way way out of my league in this regard. She's beautiful, funny, sarcastic, caring, intelligent. Everything I've ever wished in a partner. 

We go to the pub every week or so in our group of six friends including her and the couple who introduced us, as well as my other two single friends (one from Uni, and another mutual friend via the girlfriend). I have liked Lisa from early on but only got signals from friends and her that she wasn't that interested if at all, and so I didn't make a move. I didn't pine after her during this period, I looked around, had crushes on other people but she always came back into the forefront of my mind.

Now, in the last week, we've had three parties where I genuinely felt a step change. There was closeness in the body language that I'd not felt before, she let me sleep on her shoulder at one and then spent a long time chatting to me and just me and the other. Then, at the last party on Friday, she did something that either I am reading into far too much or is a clear sign she is interested, and I need objective responses! I was on a couch on my own, sat on one side with her sat next to me. All good. This is after we've spent a good hour sitting with legs touching chatting by a kitchen table. She gets up to go to the loo and when she gets back she pretty much sits on me, not next to me, but leaning very much on my side about as much as she was the sofa. I am, by this point of the night, absolutely shattered, so am not thinking too straight. She grabs a pillow and puts it on her shoulder which I use to kinda semi fall asleep on. That's how it stays for another half hour or hour or so before we get up to go. She orders an Uber, I walk home, and as she leaves I hug her goodbye which is a tight and longer than normal with other people hug, and I think THINK she goes in to kiss me on the cheek but I honestly could have imagined it or misheard a sound thinking she had.

So yeah, we've been chatting in paragraphs on Facebook on and off (we're both busy people and terrible communicators (lol how obvious is that from my end)), and I'm now seriously smitten. However we have a genuinely great friendship in a small, tight knit group and I do not want to lose that. I also don't want to miss out on the potential of this girl, so I have absolutely no idea what to do.

el1kmu|2020-01-06 22:32:35|"Did anyone find ""the one"" or just a good match? (He (29M) likes parties and I (29F) like deep conversations)"|" Two years ago, I met the most charming person. We fit really well together and are able to enjoy a lot of the same things - primarily music and same sense of humor. About a year in, I realized we lived somewhat independent lives. He was a party person, and I was a more activities person. Also he never got along with most of my friends (who don't like to party), and I never got along with most of his friends (party too much), so we avoided each other's social obligations.

After two years, I'd grown frustrated that there was not much emotional intimacy. For example, his grandfather passed, a very special person in his life, but he never talked much about it. With my own troubles, he was more the ""here's some ice cream, but not talk about it"" type of guy. Honestly, I thought it was a very sweet gesture and it did cheer me up.

I'm okay with ice cream and going to other people for deeper emotional support or reflective conversation. However, I feel that not having a deep emotional connection really plateaued our relationship for me.

From his side of things, I can only anticipate why he decided to break up with me. Honey moon phase passed, he got bored with our cute, yet predictable back-and-forth games (I still love it), or maybe he noticed that yes, I did give up on my looks a bit lol.

Even if I can rationalize why our break up might be a good thing, I really enjoyed having him in my life. He never made me feel small, never made me feel weak, always made me smile, we never fought. It was just really dandy and it worked. It sounds like he wants to find someone that gives him a spark. I hope he finds it, cause otherwise these tears are for nothing.

Did anyone really find a better fit in their following relationships or just regret? Did anyone ever find ""the one""?

Also, I'd like to morn his loss intensely to get it over with more quickly. If we're doing this band-aid style, I just want to pour hydrogen peroxide all over my wound. What are some suggestions for initiating a wallowing sessions? (For example, I created our relationship timeline and also looked at all of our photos together)

TL;DR We're a good fit, but not each other's soulmate. ( For mbti folks, I'm an INFP without an attention span, he's probably an ESFP). Is that good enough? Did anyone ever find ""the one""?"|fakefurcoat|False|https://redd.it/el1kmu|1|1.0|0|2|1|relationship_advice

He is emotionally insensitive and I am very very sensitive. He also takes care of his grandmother with dementia so most of the care he had was being funneled to her which is understandable. We decided to take a 3 month break. Originally the terms were 3 months of no contact. I bargained for one day a week to talk and one day a month to do something together. On paper it sounded good, but I am falling apart. I think communication is important and with us not talking I don't see how we can work towards being better together. He doesn't want me to message him. I have been the weak one everytime we have broken our silence. But I think we really need to talk in person and find a better way that works for both of us. I am having a hard time focusing on my personal weakness when I'm so stressed about our relationship. I typed up a message asking him to let us talk in person, but I'm afraid to hit send. I don't want to lose him. We have butted heads a lot recently, but he is the man who brought me out of my shell. He has changed me in so many good ways and I want to fight for our relationship.

We both fucked up sometimes. I ignored many red flags because I loved her so much. I had people telling me to run away right left and centre. She’s not a bad person, just a very emotionally immature one. I stuck with her and I told everyone they were wrong. I would have done anything for her. I think I would have forgiven her for anything. 

When it came down to it, we both loved each other very much, we were best friends and we clicked so fast. We had some amazing times and some amazing memories that will stick with me for life. I never in my life have had a connection like that with anyone, but I always felt like I was the only one fighting for both of us. I always felt like I was the only one that cared about wanting the relationship to work no matter what. She did things to me that, were it the other way around, she would have broken up with me over in a heartbeat. But I forgave her, every single time and never punished her for it. She dragged me through the dirt for my mistakes she made me fight for my own worth. She made me beg for her forgiveness. 

I have never been able to understand how someone who said that I was all these amazing things to them could just cut me off and have no fight in them. I’m struggling to move on because I never wanted to but I am now in a position where I have no choice. In two years I couldn’t convince her to fight for me with everything she had but it took like half an hour to convince her to block me and remove me from her life forever for my own mental health if she definitely wanted to leave me. I couldn’t convince her to keep me, but I could convince her to throw me away.

ekp8qf|2020-01-06 05:07:31|I [F18] am dating a guy [M25] and everyone tells me i am being groomed|"So, a little bit about out relationship. We started dating when i was 17, and he was 24. I understand that it may sound weird, and i do acknowledge the difference in our age. The age of consent in my country is 16, by the way.

So, we have a very loving relationship. He is a very respectful man, understanding, caring, reasonable. In the year we've been together, he has been nothing but supportive and nice toward me. I view our relationship as very pleasant. We haven't had any serious fights, and when we did bicker over something, we sat down and talked about it. 

However, everyone in my town knows me as a shy girl. And with that, a lot of my friends keep telling me how they are concerned about me, because of the age difference. For the most part, i reassure them that everything is fine and that he is a good guy. I am a virgin by the way, and he never ever asks for sex, and told me he will wait as long as i need. A year later, he doesn't bring it up and doesn't get mad at me when i stop him from doing something. 
Another example, he helped me fill in all my college applications, booked us a spa day at my favorite spa when i was stressed with exams, helps me a lot with my social anxiety when we are out. He encourages me to go out with friend and have fun. The only agreement we have is just to tell each other where we are going.

But, the problem became a few days ago when my friends and I were talking and the conversation went like this

Friend: Hey OP, we're gonna hang out at my house this weekend, and have some drinks. You coming?

Me: Oh sure, but I won't be drinking. [Boyfriend] and I agreed we will not be drinking anymore.

Friend: What? He told you that you can't drink?

Me: What, no! We talked and decided that drinking is pointless unless it's for a celebration. He's also not going to drink, it's not just me

Friend: You're crazy. Do you even hear yourself, you are letting him control you. Next thing, he's gonna tell you not to go anywhere with us

Me: No, don't worry. He is fine with me going anywhere, he trusts me. 

At this point i was really trying to brush it off, but felt very weird and offended. 

Is our agreement for drinking really a sign of being controlling? And he agreed to it too, so I don't see this as him controlling me. It's making me self conscious about our age difference."|etoile10101|False|https://redd.it/ekp8qf|23|0.83|0|44|1|relationship_advice

eky2dc|2020-01-06 18:29:48|I (24F) live with my best friend (24F) and her boyfriend (26M). He doesn't want me around.|"# 

For context, this has been my best friend for several years. They have been dating less than a year. I changed my entire life to finally move in with my best friend - we were both really excited and had wanted to live together for years. But her BF is so dramatic, I don't know what to do. I moved in a couple months after they did (I was waiting for my old lease to expire). I had only met BF on one occasion before, as we did not live near each other. He thought my best friend and I were annoying together because we feed off of each other's energy and goof around a lot. I guess he blames me entirely for that ""annoying"" stuff. I also think he would prefer to live with just her, and gets annoyed at things that are very standard when you have a roommate (for example, me being in the common area a lot, or me having a lot of possessions in the apartment). However, he knowingly agreed to this living arrangement several months in advance, as we all did!!

He has serious communication issues and pretty much refuses to just talk calmly about anything. Any time the slightest disagreement arises, he gets crazy defensive over things that literally don't matter. It just happened tonight and is why I chose to make this post. We were having a simple conversation, not even a debate. But once he got angry, BF accused her of ""always trying to prove him wrong"" and said that any time the three of us hang out together, she and I ""gang up on him"" to prove him wrong. It scares me to hear him say those things to her because it seems like he's trying to turn her against me when I've done nothing wrong. He has also told her that she and I make *him* feel like a third wheel. So, he doesn't particularly enjoy hanging out with me around.

However, he also gets huffy/moody and will give her semi-silent treatment when she and I spend time together without him. For example, last night I got home from a holiday trip and hadn't seen them in over a week. She and I hung out in my room for maybe an hour, chatting and catching up about the holiday. We then went to hang out in the common area, where he was playing a video game, and he pretty much refused to talk to her the rest of the night, til she went to bed with him.

I don't know how to handle it. He doesn't want her to hang out with me without him, but he also does not want to be around me ? I have a lot of anxiety regarding the whole thing. I truly have done nothing wrong and his behavior makes me feel sick. He just refuses to communicate calmly and gets incredibly defensive, argumentative, and creates a problem where there isn't one. I'm scared to talk to him at all because I feel he just makes everything a mess. What can I do? I truly am NOT in a position to move out and we are in this lease until August. I'm considering going the route where I just stay in my room all the time so I don't have to be around him.

TL;DR: Moved in with best friend and her BF. He finds me annoying/doesn't want to be around me. He gets argumentative and starts fights for no reason, and thinks my friend and I are always ganging up on him and trying to prove him wrong. How do I handle this?"|l3av3m3al0n3|False|https://redd.it/eky2dc|2|0.63|0|6|1|relationship_advice
el1b62|2020-01-06 22:14:03|26m somewhat ex started going on dates|"Hey all

I don’t typically post on reddit. But this is the hardest thing I’ve gone through in my life and I want it all to end. I don’t have people to talk to irl or anybody that I would want to burden by talking to anyways. 

From the beginning, my wife (25f) of 6 years and I (26m) met when we were 7 years old. I moved into her neighborhood behind her house. We had a good childhood and she was my first kiss in a game of truth or dare with our neighbor (same age as us). From the start, I would get excited and frantic when I’d see her. Even when I was young. We dated for a few months in 7th grade and eventually grew apart ( nothing bad at all just kinda both agreed to stop dating). We were still friends at this point and Its like broke up and everything was completely fine. Fast forward to 10th grade, she was coming out of a ‘serious’ relationship (as serious as they get at that age) and we had sex once. She didn’t ghost me but she didn’t want to have a relationship with me at that point. I would always try to date her because I knew she was the woman I would want to be with. 

Now jump to after high school I was 19 and joined the Army. I was a 25B so my AIT was 6 months. During the end of my tenure at AIT In Georgia, we started talking via text and things started to get more serious for me. My dream since I was a child had the potential of happening... if I didn’t fuck it up.

My first assignment in the army was at Schofield Barracks, HI. I eventually bought a plane ticket for her to come out and see me to enjoy some time together and it was magical to say the least. We did this once more except the 2nd time she came to visit, it was because I was being deployed. We ended up getting married and she stayed in Hawaii to get our place setup while I was overseas.  She is insane I know, and that’s why I was so in love. She dropped her schooling and job to move out to Hawaii and get married. Her dad wasn’t too happy but he knew I wasn’t some nut job kid since he knew me as a child.

At this point I guess I should mention that this is the only girl that I’ve dated who I NEVER had any suspicions about cheating or fowl play. She was perfect in my eyes.

After deployment + a couple months, she gets pregnant. We have a beautiful healthy child whom changed my world entirely.

A year later, we move to Texas for my next assignment. Spend 2 somewhat miserable years there because we were both longing for our hometown quite a bit and I would often play computer games to pass time. 

After the 2 years I was medically retired from the army for anxiety and depression. Both of which she helped me out with tremendously. 

After spending 2 years out of the military in our home town ( our child is 3 at this point and I’m 24) we took trip a trip to NYC and did fun vacation date night things. It seemed so good to me. 

One day I came home from work and she just started acting weird. She was very short and wouldn’t talk to me very much. After a week of that she said she didn’t want to be with me any more and I should sleep on the couch for a few days. Those few days eventually turned into me moving out and her starting the process of a divorce. 

Her reasoning was that she fell out of love ( I supposed I didn’t give her enough attention but I did what I could). Everyone we know was so confused by her behavior and questioned why in the world we would ever get a divorced we were nearly perfect together.

I couldn’t help but fall into a very hard depression and still have no motivation to do anything productive in live. I’m almost to the point of losing my job because of the depression. I dont even want to speak to anyone at work which is not good. I work at a small college so I NEED to have a good impression on the people I interact with. I’ve deleted my social media because I cannot stand to see her happy without me and I have no interest in letting anyone else down. It kills me. I know that this is what is going to make her happy so I oblige to pretty much every request of her. 

We have been living separate for 7 months now and all I can think about is her. STILL.  I cannot for the life of me get her out of my head. If it wasn’t for our son, I’m certain I would have ended my own life by now.  

I say all of that to say this
She texted me and asked to call her during my lunch today, so I of course did. She tells me that she had been going on several dates with a guy. I guess she wanted me to hear it from her rather than someone else. And immediately I tell her I cannot talk about this right now and hang up.... I don’t know if I should have done that. Probably not, but every decision I make seems like it isn’t the right one. 

I have not felt such an overwhelming feeling of wanting it all to end. 

How can I feel better? I just want her out of my head. But at the same time, she is my world and I want nothing more in life than her.

This sounds minor from the outside perspective I’m sure, but the depression is caving in and it’s heavier than I imagined.

Edit1. We are technically not divorced yet. We are actually doing a dissolution. She has all the paperwork and will be filing soon"|creezdakid|False|https://redd.it/el1b62|1|1.0|0|5|1|relationship_advice
ekw77g|2020-01-06 16:15:59|I [F19] am confused|"1,5 years ago I had a very unpleasant break up with my first love. He was in love with me for years, we were friends, and at some point started dating. Everything was great, until at some point his feelings  faded away and I could not date a guy who does not love me, although I had the strongest feelings for him. 
We broke up, and as the time passed anger, misunderstanding and all the negative thoughts about him went away, and only pain and missing him left. For a year I was going on dates with different guys, but after 1-2 dates with someone I was realizing strongly that I am still in love with my ex and cut things off.
About half a year I started a new relationship with a coworker/costudent, who was my good friend at the point. He has a better look than my ex, and we had a great friendship for a year, so I decided to try dating. 
At first everything was great, I felt some infatuation and stuff. But now everything got complicated .
First of all, I am back to thinking about my ex and having dreams about him
Also I noticed that me and my current partner do not really have anything to talk about (except for some sexual things), and I don’t really like some of his features as a person (he does not care about other people unless they are close to him, he is kind of arrogant and cruel, and he does not have close friends). 
Also I have to say that this is the first relationship for my bf, and he turned out to be not like me at all when it comes to our relationship. He is always concerned about it, he says that there is nothing he interested in except for his romantic life now (not in a healthy way, in my opinion, he stopped seeing his friends and is not really into his hobbies or anything at all), while I can’t say the same: my friends, my family, my hobbies and my professional life are still important to me. He is being very vulnerable, cries a lot and overthinks everything. I am trying to be really gentle to him, listen to what he says (although sometimes he says things that hurt me), but that shows that he has a dependance here, and I am not sure what I feel at this point. 
I am afraid that if I break up with him, I will hurt him a lot and he will have to go through everything I went through with my first break up, and I don’t want that to happen. And I might regret breaking up with him too, cause he is very handsome and romantic. And we will still have to work with him and study with him everyday, so it will be hard for me, and, I think, even worse for him 

But I don’t know what am I feeling for him and feel guilty because of the thoughts about my ex (to be clear, the chances of me ever getting back together with him are very, very low).  I don’t want to be deceitful about my feeling, and that makes me think that I am being exactly at the position of my ex when we were breaking up. 
So everything is really messed up in my head right now, I don’t know what to do. Please, guys, any advice"|jbgood2|False|https://redd.it/ekw77g|3|1.0|0|2|1|relationship_advice
eky0hr|2020-01-06 18:25:51|Inbetween happy and wanting to break up|"I know most of you are going to respond that I should break up. But I wanted to just post this and let some feelings out.

My girlfriend (22) and I (24) have been together for almost 9 months. During those months, I landed a job and moved out of my parents house to an area closer to where she lives. Everything on my end has been going great and I should be thankful to have someone who cares for me. It's a pretty healthy relationship, but I'm just not happy. 

It's gotten to the point that everything she does infuriates me. She knows how meticulous I am about my apartment: keeping it clean, not using excessive electricity, putting things back where they came from, etc. But every single time she comes over I'm picking up after her. And every time I tell her to please be mindful, she just retorts with a giggle and a sorry. But after 10 times in a day, the apologies start to not hold any meaning. Believe me, we have talked about this.

It's like she doesn't respect who I am. And I'm not a power trippy person, but mistreating my space is one way to make me angry. She also doesn't respect my need for alone time (again something we've talked extensively about). I understand that she is the kind of person who likes company constantly, but my social battery is only so strong. I need alone time just so I can do my errands and work, let alone do something fun for myself like play a video game or read. It's like when shes gone I'm scrambling to complete all my housework and errands because I have a couple hours to do so.

She's also the kind of person who claims she is a good listener. She's not. To her, good listener reads between the lines. Which is fine and a useful skill, but what I do say, she doesnt listen to, regardless if its about feelings or mundane things. I'm constantly reminding her of things that I've said before: ""yes I said I scheduled that appointment,"" ""no I told you the mechanic isnt open until 8,"" ""yes, I told you I'm fine, my headache is gone""

She's also a very nurturing person. Which I should be grateful for having someone who cares about me. But she likes to forget that I'm an adult and I can take care of myself. It's just really off putting. 

And lastly, this one is just kind of a dick move, but she's really not that smart. Or knowledgeable when it comes to life skills. We all have things we are good at but she has never paid her own bills or had a real job. Shes in college and I understand people are raised differently but it really frustrates me. She thinks money comes out my ass.

Basically, I think I know what I should do but i cant bring myself to do it. Her family loves me, she loves me A LOT and it would absolutely break her. 

And honestly, I moved to a new area and I only know a couple people. Maybe I'm just hanging on because I don't want to be alone.

Thanks for listening. And endnote, we are both women. I just didn't want to say it earlier"|Lt_gxg|False|https://redd.it/eky0hr|1|0.71|0|1|1|relationship_advice
ekuy7m|2020-01-06 14:39:09|Changing your dating anniversary|"I posted here a few months ago about my dilemma over my anniversary and birthday being on the same day (original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dgf4or/my_23f_anniversary_with_my_boyfriend_23m_is_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

After a lot of back and forth with my boyfriend, last night he said he’d be okay with changing the date to the day we started dating, and not the day we became official (which is my birthday). It’s what I wanted all along but now that it’s a serious possibility, I’m not sure how to feel about it. We’ll have been together for 2 years in May, and up until now we’ve celebrated on the day we became official. I got him an engraved guitar pic with that date on it last year. So it seems odd that after all this time, we’re suddenly changing the date. But at the same time, I’m looking forward to being able to celebrate both and on separate days. They’re still pretty close together, but at least they’re not on the same exact day. But is this still a weird thing to do? Should I just let it go and keep our original anniversary date?

EDIT: thanks guys, I know I’m overthinking this. I just think both days are important and I wasn’t sure if changing it was even worth it. I appreciate all the input 😊"|turncver|False|https://redd.it/ekuy7m|5|0.67|0|7|1|relationship_advice

We are currently living together and have always successfully solved problems quickly, however he told me he no longer feels happy in our relationship because I am not happy in our relationship. This is untrue on many levels.

I have desperately told him, almost begging for him, to help me solve things, and work it out together. He told me no, and said that we'd just fall into the same pitfalls later on so it's not even worth it now. However, we've only had two prior fights in our relationship that got solved within a day and never came up again. Every time I ask him to help me solve this, he outright refuses and gives a hard NO. Every time.

I'm so confused. Last night he got high and told me he still loves me and doesn't want to leave me. He wants my comfort and love, and he even kissed me. I'm so confused on where to go on this. He has also told me that he wants to continue living together and help out and he's even wanting to take me on 'friendship dates'. Our lease ends February 29th of this year. I know he wants to fix it but is being stubborn and refused to talk to me about it. He says he wants to find happiness again, but he's admitted he's scared he's giving me up because I genuinely made him happy. I told him I support him because I want him to find peace and he cried. He told me he wants me around and wants to talk  to me still, and he's scared to let me go.

 I feel so abandoned. He's always been so supportive and helpful, even through my mental struggles, but now he thinks it's too much. I want nothing more than to heal our relationship and fix things so we can be happy again.

Should I give him his space and let him figure it out on his own, or should I continue to try being his friend and support him through this, even though it's breaking my heart? Is our relationship salvageable, or should I just give up and let him do his thing?

I calmed her by talking about a happy place and that she didn't need to worry about it for a very very very long time.

Mine and my sisters grandfather passed away 2 years ago.

My dog passed away a few weeks ago.

She spoke of granddad but I assumed she meant someone on her dads side.


I thought I'd calmed her.

She broke down in tears to my mum and sister and told them that I told her about death after telling ME that an ""Aunt Kath"" (fathers side) told her!

Apparently shes only seen Aunt Kath twice with my sister present.

So obviously it sounds like I told her about death and traumatised her.

I am currently sick, lifelong illness will always require medicine and is deadly without treatment so obviously who does my sister believe? Her child.

el175b|2020-01-06 22:06:23|[24M] I (think I) resent my [21F] gf|"In a nutshell, it kind of feels like I may resent my gf a little. We've been dating for a year and some change now and have definitely had a connection from the start. Since around halloween though we've had harder and harder times getting through our problems. In the beginning it was very ""Us versus the problem"" and we got pretty good at being clear and compromising or changing certain things that need changing. I've noticed more and more that she hardly apologizes during fights. And at first I didn't notice because I was wrong for something and would see it and apologize. But there's more and more times and triggers that lead to making her upset and angry (hanging up on me, not wanting to talk to me, etc.) even though she does the same triggers to me in my opinion. I could probably count on like two hands the times she has said a real sorry to me. Not a ""im sorry you got annoyed"" or me having to point out that she needs to apologize. I feel like I'm having a shorter and shorter temper when for certain things and can't take the hypocrisy as much and I feel like a lot of times, I'm being stubborn in fights because I just wish she would say sorry and mean it. I wish she would tell me what is wrong instead of ""I dont know"" and ""I dont care"" when she is clearly acting different. I think when she doesn't say sorry, I don't feel like the fight gets resolved. Like she puts her own pride and ideas before our relationship. Even though she may admit it was bad communication or we both were in the wrong, it's rare for her to be straight up and apologize sometimes. 

The latest fight was caused because she made plans with her friends and got mad that I only met up with her after my plans with my friends didn't go through. She thinks that she was my ""back up plan"". She never invited me with her so I didn't want to assume. I invited her with my plans though. Then she only invites me after I invite her. Like she was waiting for me like some test type deal. The rest of the night she was pretty upset with me, i.e. not wanting to touch each other or wear my jacket even though she was cold. Stuff like that. The part that annoyed me was we just landed that night from a trip with my family. In the car going back to drop her off at her house she texts her friend seeing what she can do tonight. After saying she misses her dad so much at home and all that she goes out after less then an hour back home. I made plans with my friends because she did with hers to be honest. I told her ""if I knew you wanted to go out we could have made better plans"" and she said ""I told you I texted my friend, you want me to be clearer?"". She asked me the next day why I was mad at her and I said what I summarized here. And the whole time she has a reason for everything. Like she didn't want my jacket because it was already almost the end of the night. Or she didn't want to kiss me the whole night ""because she put on lip gloss"". She then said ""Next time I'll just talk to you clearly like a Kindergartner because that's what you want right?"" and I told her ""you have no respect for me when we fight. You can't even just say sorry and mean it"" and she now wants space from me.

Fast forward to summer of 2018 and I found an engagement ring in his bag when I was looking for my travel toothbrush holder. We ended up talking about it and I found out he had bought it back around the pregnancy. So, I was disappointed but if he isnt ready, hes not ready. 

Fast forward again to spring of 2019 and all of my mental health issues caused me to finally snap and ask him if he even wanted to be with me. He said yes, but he wasnt sure if he wanted to marry me because of all my issues. So I went to therapy, got on meds, and am finally in a good mindset. I've addressed all the issues he stated and have learned how to manage them. 

Then in november of 2019 he gets drunk one night and tell me he was going to propose at my family reunion we had in September, but since my cousin just got engaged he didnt want to outshine their moment. I was so happy! 

Now its january. Our anniversary has come and gone. And there hasn't been any mention of it again. My friends say he might just be waiting for the right moment, but I'm just not sure. I'm worried he doesnt know if he wants to marry me. Everytime I try to talk about it with him he avoids it or just says I'm making him feel bad. But I just want to know what is going to happen with my future. I dont need to know when it's going to happen, but him at least saying hes waiting for the right time would be nice to ease my mind. 

I love him, I want a family and kids with him. But I also never wanted to wait until my 30s to have kids. What if I wait another three years for him to decide he doesnt want me after all? 

I just would really like some advice."|thrwy638q9t|False|https://redd.it/el16et|1|0.67|0|5|1|relationship_advice
ektfk6|2020-01-06 12:20:05|[M21] Working with past FWB [F22] feel like somethings wrong HELP|"So I started a new job 3 months back and to my surprise my last FWB is working there. We had a good history, we knew each other a while before we hooked up on a night out, were I talked to her 45 mins walking to my house before we did the dirty. We met up a few more times before the holidays and we seem to hit it off pretty well, our pillow talk was good and she seemed really into me. She was the first to ask for my number and once we split for holidays and she went back to her home country she texted me first, 3 days after I left for home.

During the holiday we texted back and fourth for 5 weeks and once we were both back we went out again. However, the night went to shit because I got way to drunk and may have been too clingy. She got pretty drunk too and she threw up on the way home. Anyway we still had sex after. Next morning she said that we should probably stop, I didn't know how to respond but I just let it slide and she said that I was one of her best friends and that we could still keep doing this. She left and a few hours later she sent me a video of me and her dancing. I responded a day later with a funny joke. We texted a bit after this and I invited her out again but she said she was busy with exams and work and said she would tell me on the day. I didn't get a response and at that point I knew it was over so I stopped bothering.

Fast forward a month after exams I am out with my friends and she was also with us, we hugged and exchanged small talk but I was over it and just had a laugh with my friends and she stuck with hers. I got pretty wasted and got lost, tried to call her and my friends a few times. Got peed off and then removed her on insta, facebook and snapchat and told her to ""not contact me lol"".

And that was the last of it, 6 months later she still follows me on instagram and I find out she's still in the city and working  in  the nightclub I got hired at. Our first conversation was kinda awkward because I was surprised she was still here and she explained why.

At first I didn't really try to talk to her, I would say hello if I saw her not busy. Otherwise I didn't really make eye contact. I've made quite a few friends at work and people seem to really like me (except a few who I will get too) and I have good banter with pretty much everyone except her and she definitely notices.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Recently, however, she's made some effort to talk to me when she has conversation, when we were working new years a drunk guy passed out at the bar and she told me ""he wont leave without my number"", I notice and ask ""Is he alright?"". I then wave my hand in front of his face as a joke and she laughs and I tell her ""you should definitely get his number"". I then went behind him and did a funny pose as laughs whilst he was still asleep.

She is also talks to me if she knows one of our friends is in the nightclub. Otherwise I make no effort to start a conversation with her but I will respond calmly if she talks to me.

Anyways, one of the people working there is a massive prick and I knew him from last year. He has no respect for anyone and is only talkative to people he likes (women and a few colleges, he's also a ugly little bastard) he doesn't like me because I bite back if he tries to belittle me or boss me around. But he gets one with the girl I used to sleep with and a few other girls because he is friendly with them. Anyways this loser (who is also now recently a supervisor) trying to impress another girl throws shit on the ground and tries to get me to clean it up because I am a backbar, I tell him to fuck off and he tells me I should go home. I get him into trouble with the managers because he's abusing his power. And I just noticed recently she un-followed me and I believe it could be related to this dickhead.

I just need some advice, does she want me to talk to her? Is it worth talking to her outside of work about our situation? Are we still friends? I cannot tell from the way she is acting if she likes me or not because she definitely doesn't treat me the same as the other co-workers and she makes more of an effort to talk to me then I do to her.

tl:dr

Past FWB that I used to get on with really well is at work, I cannot tell if it's worth pursuing a friendship. We don't talk much at work and she's been approaching me more than I have with her. She's also just recently un-followed me on Instagram which I don't know is related to me standing up for myself with my dick-head supervisor or she still cares? Just seems a bit odd to do that now."|Dieselblue9|False|https://redd.it/ektfk6|6|0.86|0|2|1|relationship_advice
el154c|2020-01-06 22:02:33|Do I take things to the next level with this guy?|"Throwaway account because I know the guy who this is based about uses reddit.

A few months ago I(22F) broke up with my long term boyfriend, of four and a half years. It was a very toxic relationship and he sucked a lot of the life out of me. It's one of those situations where everyone has told me that I am finally back to myself, hold my head higher etc. I got with this boy when I was 17 and therefore have never been a single adult.

Not very long after breaking up with my ex (talking a couple of weeks), I have met a lovely guy. We started as something casual and it has developed into feelings. He has been very open about his feelings and has told me that the ball is in my court with where we take things. We spend a lot of time together, he's been a perfect gentleman and we laugh a lot together. 

Here's my struggle, do I commit myself to this new guy? I really like him but my worry is that if I do not take this time to he single I may regret it down the line? Part of me feels like I need to take this time for myself but then the other half of me thinks it would be stupid to let someone so great go and don't want to regret that later down the line.

So guess I am asking if anyone has been in a similar situation? What did you do? Do you regret it?"|lampcandle123|False|https://redd.it/el154c|1|1.0|0|2|1|relationship_advice

We have great chemistry and enjoy being with each other . Over the course of our friendship , I developed feelings for her . I was about to finally ask her out tomorrow but after what I've been told , I've decided to leave it 

We went out with some mutual friends on Thursday and there was a time in the evening where I and some guys weren't there . The girls asked her if she likes me more than a friend and she reacted with a sort of ewww face and said no , we're just friends. She told them that she wasn't looking for a relationship but she cares about me alot .

She then explained how everyone thinks (even her mom) that we would end up a couple but she doesn't think so . She said that she is convinced I don't have feelings for her even though she thought so before . She told one friend that she might have felt as if she did but she doesn't now .

A friend of mine said that it seemed as if she is into me but her pride and ego hold her back . We have flirted a lot , touched a lot , we constantly tease each other and when it's a group situation , she always sits next to me . She even dropped hints of people not making a move on her when they should've . When we played never have I ever , she drank to a question about finding someone attractive in the room when she knew no one else but me there. 

I guess I got all of these signs wrong . I feel as if I was giving her too much attention to begin with and she just took it for granted . No hard feelings against her but I thought we might of had something , just suprised that when she was questioned she considered me nothing.

I still see her tomorrow and honestly don't even know what I should do ?"|idontknowwhybutokay|False|https://redd.it/el14gc|1|0.67|0|9|1|relationship_advice
el144x|2020-01-06 22:00:39|(F22) concerned he might be married. Need some advice!|"So there’s a guy at my work who comes in everyday. Literally everyday and sometimes all he does is buy a bottle of coke. But he’s always called me beautiful and has always been flirting with me. I let him for a few months and then we swapped phone numbers. 

So we started texting back and forth. He takes ages to reply to my messages sometimes. I’m talking hours. I know he works and regularly goes to the gym. But even on his days off it takes a while. If I don’t reply to his messages instantly he bombards me with them. Asking if im still talking to him etc. 

So the other day we’re texting and I ask if he’s coming In today because he hasn’t been and it’s getting real late. He turns up with his young daughter. That took me by surprise a little. He starts the usual calling me beautiful and everything and then another young girl walks in and starts talking to his daughter. Well turns out that’s his daughter too. As soon as she comes in he stops dead mid conversation and doesn’t talk to me rushes out of the shop to talk to a woman in the car. 

One of my colleagues told me it’s his wife! So I’m very confused. He told me he never had a wife or girlfriend. I ask him about it he’s adamant that it’s just his daughters mother and that there’s nothing going on. I apologise profusely! But now things are starting to add up.

TLDR: am I being paranoid or is he taking me for a mug? He takes forever to reply. Even when he says he’s not busy. Told me he lives alone and then when we arrange to meet up all of a sudden he’s in a flat share? He never tells me anything about his life he’s always asking about mine and then when I ask him personal things he just deflects then questions. Everything is always so sexual. It’s pointless asking him because I feel like all he does is lie."|Morgie-lee|False|https://redd.it/el144x|0|0.5|0|15|1|relationship_advice

el13mi|2020-01-06 21:59:40|My boyfriend cheated on his ex with his current best friend|I’m in a pretty great relationship. There’s only one thing I have to complain about and that’s her. His best friend and roommate. We’ve been together 6 months and it’s clear that we’re pretty perfect for each other, neither of yes has been happier than we are now. He’s basically moved in with me but has 3 months left on his lease so not officially. When we started dating I met his best friend/roommate and she seemed ok, kind of bitchy but I can handle it. A few weeks in I made a joke about sex in front of her and she said ewwww and I sarcastically replied “don’t knock it till you try it” and that’s the night I found out that they hooked up a few times about 7 years ago. That was easy enough to get past because they’d been platonic friends for so long, or so I thought. Yesterday i found out after a bit of digging that he cheated on his last girlfriend with his roommate 4 years ago and they stopped talking for a couple years then reconnected and it’s been platonic ever since. She’s been jealous and rude to me since about 2 months into our relationship and I know it’s because he was her “emotional fluffier” (crawling into his bed drunk and crying about some asshole at the bar, falling asleep with her feet in his lap, etc). He has distanced himself from her a bit but won’t set boundaries with her as he has a pretty bad fear of confrontation. I’ve been trying for months to be cool with her but after finding this out I don’t want her in my life anymore. I’m not the type of girlfriend to set ultimatums, I’m pretty laid back in general, but I think their friendship is weird at best, at worst, wildly inappropriate. I trust him fully but I don’t trust their friendship. Is it wrong of me to ask him to take a break from their friendship? If she was a good friend I would try to move past it but she is a negative influence in his life in so many ways. I don’t want to be the crazy controlling girlfriend but Im a people pleaser and I often find myself pushing my own feelings aside for other people. Help.

el13jr|2020-01-06 21:59:30|I (F29) am married to the love of my life (M31) but i am having struggles w monogamy all the sudden and I know it’s ruining my fresh marriage (18 months)|"So a little back story of our infidelity issues. After having our son, I was dealing with postpartum depression and felt disgusted w myself. I joined an app that lets you video chat w random people, not realizing it was primarily for dating, and I wanting to use it to make friends. Anyway, I met a guy on there and we had things in common so we began to talk regularly... at some point things turned sexual and pictures were exchanged as well as I met up w him at a gas station for a total of 10 min just to meet him in person. Mind you he didn’t know my real name. Well the husband found out via looking through my emails and phone. So it was ended, the use of the app all together as well as my talking to the other man...  we’ll about 4 months later, I get a random message from some guy on fb saying “You need to watch your husband, he’s been talking sexually to my gf.” I immediately woke him up to confront him, he acted like he didn’t know who the guy was or what he was talking about. Upon further inspection of the random guys fb I find out who is gf is and realize it’s a name and a person I’ve heard of from my husband before. So it can’t be a misunderstanding.. my husband denied any inappropriate talk but the bf has sent me the messages between the two (mind you it seemed as though certain parts of the conversation had been deleted.) I also happened to notice the conversation was had around our one year anniversary and I was just now finding out about it from the woman’s bf, two months after it happened. The husband went through and deleted her messages but I later went looking through his phone and noticed, he didn’t block her or
Delete her number out of his phone. But yet he remembered to delete the messages between them. Anyhow husband finds out this guy on reddit is trying to instigate something between us and because I entertained the ideal for a little while, also bragging about my husband at the same time. He found out and was hurt once again. So then he suggests we do a couples thing and try experimenting w online flirting and posting anonymous pictures... which was fun in the beginning but we were bored w it within 2 weeks tops. Well towards the end of that experiment my husband shows me Chatroulette, which for those who don’t know. It’s where you randomly get connected w someone that could be anywhere in the world. We were on there together laughing at peoples jokes and playing along w the perves. Well I ended up going onto the site by myself one day out of boredom and came across a guy, who for once wasn’t showing his junk as soon as the camera turned on. We held a half an hour convo that went smooth and next thing I know he suggests we “play” on video together. At that exact moment I didn’t think it was the worst idea because
I was introduced to the website by my husband. So he and I did do online “play.” Well recently it started to weigh on me so I just told him one night that I didn’t just talk to the handsome British guy but that I also did stuff on video w him. Now my husband and I are in an even shittier position. I don’t know what boundaries I should obey and which ones are ok to be crossed. He is my longest running relationship, and even though I haven’t physically cheated it’s basically the same. He says I must be unhappy but I think I might just be discovering more of my sexual personality. I don’t want to ruin our marriage, it’s purely a vanity/ physical thing. I would never love another like I love my husband but I don’t know what to do. I didn’t feel this way before, I was so excited to spend the rest of our lives together and now I’m not sure if what I want and what he wants is the same thing. I need help. Am I a sex addict or something.. he says he wants to fix us but what if I enjoy flirting and stuff w other men? It’s not like anything would happen in real life... I feel like the shittiest wife ever, and I know I probably am. What can I do?"|jordysmom0213|False|https://redd.it/el13jr|1|0.67|0|4|1|relationship_advice
el125t|2020-01-06 21:56:47|How should I (m17) continue with my friend (f17)|"So a few months ago I started talking to a girl I knew on snap chat. We knew IRL for like 2 years but never really spoke. We started talking about normal stuff every other day and a few weeks later we chatted every day for 1-2 hours and met often, mostly just walked around and talked or got something to eat. A few times she ""jokingly"" said it would be really cool if we were in a relationship. The problem is that I will move out soon (when I'm finished with school and turn 18 this summer)  and I'll live around 600km (370miles)  away from her. She said that that's okay and we can just continue as it was before and we'll see. We still talked and 2 weeks ago she visited me and kissed me. It was my first kiss and it was so great (I do like her), so I kissed her back. We kissed for some time and after some time we started making out. After that, she confessed to me that she had feelings for me for nearly one year. Now I don't know what to do, I really like her and I could imagine being in a relationship with her, but it feels like I have a ticking alarm clock in my head that in only 5-6 months we have to end it. Also, I have my finals soon so I'll be pretty busy for the next months. I really don't want to hurt her feeling by being in a relationship for a few months where I won't have much time for her and then moving away, but she says we should just enjoy the moment, and we'll regret it that we didn't spend the time we had together.

ekvytr|2020-01-06 15:58:34|Cousin (18F) has been speaking badly about me (24F) on social media for no apparent reason and I'm not sure how to fix this situation|"I'm very close to my cousin, we always say that we're more like sisters than cousins. Around 2-3 years ago she told me to follow her on Twitter. I didn't have an account at the time and told her so. Recently, I've had to make an account for ""networking"" and generally keeping up to date with things related to what I'm studying.

I remembered her username from a couple of years ago because it was really specific to something she loves and still loves. I went on her account and was really surprised to see the way she was talking about me, her parents, and our grandmother. Her parents I can kind of understand because she's had a lot of problems with them. But I don't understand why she constantly refers to my grandmother as a ""cunt."" The only time we see our grandmother is when we're together and the only thing she ever does is overfeed us and give us money to buy sweets from the shop, even at our ages. She's never done anything to my cousin to warrant being called that disgusting name.

She never mentioned me by name but I pretty much figured out she was talking about me because the dates she was writing things would match up with days we went out or spent together. The most recent example is from today. I was going shopping after uni and asked if she needed anything. She said that she'll come with me because she misses me and hasn't seen me. But then she wrote on her page after our call, ""ffs why do I always say yes to going out with her. She's so annoying."" 

I'm really really hurt. I've never had so much as one argument with this girl. Whenever she has a problem, she calls and messages me crying, she's the one who asks to meet up. So I really don't understand why she talks the way she does. Reading through her page, it was as if it was a completely different person. And it's not like she gets likes or comments for saying it, there's one girl who sometimes replies but that's about it. 

I wrote all of this out a couple of months ago when I came across it but decided to delete it from my phone and to instead get over it. But I've been checking since then because I can't help seeing if she's said anything negative about me or my gran again. Seeing today's one has really upset me. When I dropped her back off at her house today, she asked if she could come to my place sometime this week because she misses me. So I really don't understand what's going on with her. I'm not willing to cut her out of my life over this because I love her, plus, she's family. But I'm not sure whether I should confront her or not? I'm meeting her on Thursday. Or maybe delete my own account so I can stop going on her profile?"|ThrowRAcousinhatesme|False|https://redd.it/ekvytr|3|1.0|0|8|1|relationship_advice

I still love him very very much, but I am no longer 'in love' with him. And I feel much less attracted to him than I ever have before. 

I feel sad because he's my best friend, its going to hurt to lose him and not have him to talk to anymore. I also struggle with anxiety and I feel like when I feel anxious or nervous, I could text him whenever and I would feel a lot better. I'm worried about not having this person to help in these moments. 

I also struggle with making friends and talking to new people, I worry that I might not meet new guys as easily and naturally as I met him, as we met through uni and I am now full time working. 

I am also worried that I am making a mistake. He has made romantic gestures in the past and I know I mean a lot to him, he truly loves me and I  love him a lot, but I know that I am too young to be in an unhappy relationship. I am just very worried that I'll be making a mistake by breaking up with him.

I am such an indecisive person but currently I'm unhappy with the relationship (and have been for months) and I know I need to leave. But I keep convincing and then unconvincing myself. I just don't know what to do.

My parents are divorced and I (22F) live with my dad because i dislike my mother and my dad is just generally a better person. My siblings live with my mother, including one sibling who is very problematic (drug abuse, partying etc. and is 16 years old)

Last year i got a pet bunny, because i suffer from anxiety and have suffered from depression so i wanted one. I payed and still pay everything with my own money, so my dad doesn’t pay shit. 

He does love my bunny though, he pets him and likes seeing him play around and allows him to free roam (he roams free in my room) and he hasn’t gotten mad about him peeing on the sofa before. 

Today he came back from visiting my siblings, and i didn’t realise he was angry due to it until i went to the living room and saw him kick my bunny. I was so startled and just loduly said ”what are you doing?” Before picking my bunny up and putting him in my room. 
The kick wasnt super hard, but my bunny did get kicked so that his feet werent touching the ground although i dont know if my bunny jumped by himself or if it was from the force of the kick. I have accidentally kicked my bunny before (because my bunny runs after me and i dont realise hes in front of my feet and i just keep walking) and it didnt look like it was more force used this time than when ive accidentally done it, but its more about my dad doing it intentionally. 

My dad hasnt spoken to me since, its been around 2 hours, and he just went to bed. I have no idea what to do, i dont want him to think this is an okay thing to do to my bunny. 
My dad has a past of being abusive (not anymore though) so sometimes i do get scared of him when i know hes angry.

Still flirty, but said she was trying to lose feelings because she thought I didn't want to be with her. I reaffirmed, tried to clear things up. Things left in a weird limbo. Said she's not going to just stop talking to me. Only message from her in the last 3 weeks is a ""Merry Christmas ❤"", tried giving her some space, tried leaving her messages to let her know I'm thinking of her still if she's going through a sad isolation period. Not sure if I've been ghosted, or if her mental state is pushing me away, and what I can/should/shouldn't do.

I met this girl a 3 months ago, and we immediately had amazing chemistry, the likes of which I've never experienced before.  It was amazing.  We would talk nearly every day and it quickly evolved into sweet good morning texts and goodnight ❤ texts and cute things.  We'd send pictures to each other and would compliment each other. Things got flirty quickly, we'd talk about deep things.  Every day I'd wake up and be excited to see her messages, and if I was up first excited to send her one, because talking to her mad my sad days so much better. We were both excited to talk and mutually interested.  I haven't had luck with dating because I'm picky and don't click with people often, but we clicked immediately, and eventually I learned she checked basically every one of my boxes.

She soon told me that she doesn't have any friends, and hasn't in a really long time. She stays home all day. She also let me know she deals with some mental health things, and they sometimes rule her life. Things like major anxiety, ocd, and depression + SAD.  I also suffer from major depression and anxiety, but I know that people can be affected by it differently.  I asked about ocd and how it affects her but never really got a clear answer because she said she doesn't really like talking about it.  I understand that and left it.  Not wanting to bring up bad things she doesn't want to think or talk about.

With these things, she would sometimes go silent and not talk throughout the day. Usually for a few hours, sometimes for an entire day sometimes a few.  When I asked about it she said sometimes she just gets overwhelmed and doesn't know how to deal with it, so she goes into her shell.  I'd get messages like ""Sorry we didn't talk today, I was just feeling really overwhlemed and sad. I'm going to go to bed now I hope I can talk tomorrow.  Sweet dreams!! Goodnight ❤ "". I'd try to be as supportive as possible, and I'd I'd ask her if she wanted to talk about it, it was always no, or that it was just her adjusting to new medication, or she's not used to having someone to talk to and it's just an adjustment, and that she really like's talking. So I told her that I'd be here if she did want to talk, that I'm not going anywhere unless she wants me to, and to let me know if there is anything I can do. She told me she really appreciated it.  After a month of really hitting it off, she told me that she's been getting sadder lately and that she goes through phases of being ok and being extremely sad, and when that happens she shuts down socially.  I again, told her I that I don't plan on going anywhere and I'm here if she wants to talk or if there's anything I could do to help. I get it, because I've gone through similar things, but I guess I dealt with it differently.

After she told me this  I could feel our conversations getting less and less enthusiastic and they did for the next few weeks.  We'd still flirt and tease, she'd seem smiley, we'd still send cute pictures and compliment each other, call each other cute names and send cute goodnight texts. But we were talking less and less. Soon it devolved into one ""real"" conversation a week, with a few smaller conversations throughout the week. Usually a few days of not talking at all.  The worst was 4 days. I'd send her messages to let her know I'm thinking of her, I'd ask how she was doing, she'd say ""I'm ok"". I'd leave her messages about the things I'm doing, even if I wouldn't get a response because I hoped knowing someone was thinking of you, even if you didn't want to talk, would help.  I know with depression, at least for me, it sucks all the joy out of life and I don't often want to do anything because everything is overwhelming.  Maybe OCD makes it hard throughout the day to talk or allows bad thoughts to stick and not allow you to. But knowing someone was thinking of me would really help.

A few weeks ago she said that a few weeks prior we had a conversation that she felt like meant I didn't want to be with her. I know it doesn't matter \_what\_ I said or if that was my intent or not if I made her feel that way, but in the conversation I was clear I was really interested in moving forward. I tried to explain what I mean't in that conversation better, reaffirmed I was still very interested in her and wouldn't reject her, and she said she doesn't know and can't just regain feelings immediately, even if it was a miscommunication.  She then started saying things about what's the problem with being friends, and that she's moved on because she had to because it would be awkward liking me if I didn't like her... but I did really like her, more than ever, and my actions other than that one conversation showed that. I guess that's where I screwed up because maybe I wasn't clear enough in where I thought we were going, and I assumed we were still on the same page. This is the last real conversation we've had. Then she told me she was going to be busy during the holidays and probably wouldn't be talking much.

If that was the end of the story, it would be clear what was happening. Or maybe I'm just naive. But then she wished me a sweet goodnight.  Maybe it was just being polite, or for old times sake, or to try and cheer me up. Feeling like I failed explaining to her how I felt because I'm bad with words, I spent a few hours after she left and wrote a long message apologizing and trying make everything crystal clear, my feelings, where I thought and wanted things were going, telling her I'm not going to abandon her unless she tells me to leave. Reaffirming I would never hurt her or reject her and telling her that I want her to be happy, no matter what that means.

Confusing. This conversation where she felt like I rejected her happened \_after\_ she told me she was getting sad, and I imagine after it happened it probably made that sadness worse and she just didn't want to talk to me about it, understandably, even though I think communication could have made this situation at least a little bit better.  I've been thinking about all our interactions and even in the weeks leading up to this revelation, and they were still good interactions, the kind of interactions someone would have if you were interested in each other. So that's why I'm confused.  She'd say things like she loves talking to me, would be super smiley and cute, sending hearts, telling me I'm cute, and that she's not going to just stop talking to me.  But then she did, over the holidays, silent for 7 days.She said she was going to be busy, and when she's been busy in the past she doesn't talk. This isn't new, just a longer silence, but it was the holidays so I get it. Christmas morning I got a ""Merry Christmas ❤"" message.  I sent one back, asking how the holidays have been. But that was the last message I've received.  That's the only message I've received in the almost 3 weeks until today.

So that's why I'm so confused.  Am I crazy, or is this just filled with mixed signals?

I've been thinking about this a lot (which is probably unhealthy) but I've come up with a few scenarios.

1. She has ghosted me. Why I think this isn't the case (though probably naive). We talked about how we thinking ghosting is dumb, in our last real conversation she even said she wouldn't just stop talking to me, I don't understand why you'd be flirty and cute for weeks even if you weren't feeling it, and send them a Merry Christmas ❤ message like that and then just stop talking.  Seems like there's some kind of conflict there, and unclear-ness, knowing what I know about her and her mental health.
2. She's super sad and isolating/pushing me away. Because she doesn't know how else to cope with her sadness (she said straight out this is what she does, she isolates herself and copes with it alone), both the sadness that I (possibly) brought on and the regular sadness she's been dealing with for years.  She can't/doesn't want to talk because she's trying to deal with things herself.
3. A mix of both. I've overwhelmed her, she doesn't know what she wants from me, or she does but is afraid to hurt me.

I know it's not about me, but whatever the reasons are it hurts me. What should I do? Is there anything I can do? I've been sending her messages every few days during the silence but I don't know if she even reads them. Letting her know I've been thinking of her, wishing her happy new years asking what she did and telling her about my boring night.  Most recently I sent a longer message suggesting things I could do to maybe help if it is the sadness she's being consumed by, and if there isn't anything I can do, letting her know I'll be there for her when she finds her way out.  Trying my best to be a good friend and patient because when I've gone through similar things that's what I wished someone would do for me. I'm just not good with things like this, so I'm looking for advice.  For people with mental health issues (ocd, depression, anxiety), is pushing people away like this something that you've done or experienced? What would you do for someone you cared for who is dealing with this? Or do you think she's just ghosted me? Is that something people do, act all sweet and normal and then just drop?

ekvv13|2020-01-06 15:50:28|I [28F] am having trouble supporting my boyfriend’s [33M] new career path.|"I have been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year and a half. Currently we see each other just on the weekends as he works 3rd shift as a trucker driver, and is gone over 1/2 the week for work. In the last year he has expressed wanting to move on from truck driving. He hates working 3rd shift, hates being on the road, and has back problems that are exemplified from sitting for long periods. I totally understand why he wants a career change 100%, that I am not denying, and I have been totally onboard for it. 

A few months back he applied to the IBEW, something he really had been wanting to get into, but unfortunately was not accepted into their union. He then went for his hoisting license, and got 1 of the 2 licenses. He had plans to study and eventually go back to get the other license, but now has no interest. 

About 2 months ago a whole new obsession has emerged out of no where, marijuana. I’m not uppity about marijuana. I used to be a bit of a stoner, and now I smoke from time to time, but he has began revolving his life around it. He started growing plants (they’re thriving actually, which is cool, and we do live in a state where it is legal) which he bought literal hundreds if not upwards of a couple thousands of materials to grow them (huge grow tent, special lights, fans, humidifiers,etc..). He now makes this the pinnacle of basically all his conversations with people. It makes me a little uneasy because I don’t know how everyone he talks to feels about it, and he will go on forever about it which also gets kind of boring and annoying to people. I’ve gotten to the point where if I hear him start talking about it I just kind of let him ramble and basically block it out. I know this sounds mean, but I just don’t understand where this obsession has come from.

The kicker is right now he can’t even smoke. He hasn’t smoked in years, and he’s kind of acting like one of those kids who thinks being a pothead is the best and only way to be. He’s been applying to jobs all over. Today he interviewed for a-wait for it-driving position! It’s basically what he’s doing now except during the day, and he’ll be making $50,000 LESS than what he is making now. He also said there is a little room for growth, but quite honestly there won’t be much moving up at all. 

It isn’t all about the money, and I feel selfish thinking about it, but we’ve been talking about buying a house and moving in together, and now I feel like that’s going to be on the back burner for a while if he gets a job in this field. I want to support him, but I feel so stuck. I want to tell him how I don’t think this is the best career path, but don’t want to break his heart about it either. I’m secretly hoping it falls through, and that he starts looking at different options. I’m just very confused, and looking at advice for how to deal with this situation!

TLDR: My boyfriend is looking at starting a new career path that I’m not sure is going to work out for him in the long run. How can I approach the subject without being insensitive and squashing his excitement?"|abbydoobie1221|False|https://redd.it/ekvv13|3|0.8|0|9|1|relationship_advice
el0xjh|2020-01-06 21:48:03|Broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years.|"I’m sorry I’m advance for this huge wall of text. 

Hey reddit. I (20 F) need some advice from some strangers. I don’t even know how to begin writing this. I am so lost. We’ve been together since I was 16 and him 18. When we met I was addicted to drugs and severely depressed. We’ve had a lot of ups and downs in our relationship, but I think the real problems, for me, started about a year ago. I got sober last November, and I think it put a lot of strain on our relationship. It was hard because our dynamic had really changed, we used to drink an equal amount when we would go out, and then we didn’t anymore because I couldn’t. I started seeing him less because he would want to go be a normal 21 y/o guy, and I couldn’t be a part of that. I don’t like his drinking, and a big part of that is because we really only ever fought when we were both drunk, and a few times he’s gotten really out of control. On Friday I threw him a party for his birthday, I spent a good while planning it/ decorating/ buying food and drinks, and then he blacked out and put me in a really uncomfortable position. It was very triggering for me to be around, he was like passed out on the floor kinda drunk. On Saturday I think he was really embarrassed and was having a really awful date with anxiety all day, so I didn’t want to bring any of my resentments up yet. On Sunday, I let my anger and frustration boil over and ended up chewing him out for the way he acted when he was drunk/ for getting that drunk. We ended up breaking up. It wasn’t an angry break up, it was just really sad. I’ve never seen him cry like that. Afterwards I cried really fucking hard for about 3 hours and then I realized I made a huge mistake and started calling and texting non stop on multiple social media platforms. I’m not going to glaze over that, don’t worry. I don’t know what got into me. He said he needed space to think and I just couldn’t respect that. I feel crazy. I feel so embarrassed. He ended up blocking me, and today he texted me that he needed more time to think and that we both needed to really honestly evaluate if we wanted to be in this relationship. I keep going back and forth. Literally about 2 hours ago I was like “no I can’t do it” and now I’m sitting here convinced that we should be together. I’m genuinely so confused and I don’t know what to do. 
He confessed to me on Sunday that he’s been really depressed. I knew he was, but every time I tried to talk to him about his feelings he would shut off. He became really emotionally distant from me, and I think I started acting up just to get some sort of attention from him. I know that’s blindly unhealthy, but I’m just trying to be transparent here. 
He stuck by me through the hardest points in my life, he stuck by me when I tried to get sober before, and he stuck by me through all of my trauma that has resurfaced over the years. I feel like such a coward for leaving when I feel like he needs me the most, but I also know that I can’t be responsible for his happiness. At this point, I’m so scared of letting go of the vulnerability and love that we share, but on the other hand I feel like I have the opportunity to redefine myself outside of the relationship. 

Honestly any advice you guys have would be much appreciated."|misserlou|False|https://redd.it/el0xjh|2|1.0|0|6|1|relationship_advice
el0xdj|2020-01-06 21:47:45|Boundary Crossed|"Hi all,

Long time reader, first time poster.

A friend and I have been friends for years (both 30 something) at the behest of my parents and several other friends. This person has always been intense and pushed me outside of my comfort zone. Simultaneously, this person is a live wire and just moved to my town. 

I had a chill gathering (we were drinking wine and getting out board games just to set the scene), everyone came to my house, she brought her ex boyfriend (which initially I was like eh whatever live your life), consumed drugs, got drunk and tried to get busy on my bed. I kicked them out and have never been that mad at a friend. We talked it out and she agreed to keep it chill. That’s my mistake but I was trying to be conscious of the fact that people were drinking and I live far away. 

One of my dear friend’s girlfriend wasn’t feeling well and laid down in a guest room. My childhood friend asks if she can lay down to which I said only if the guest room is free, which it doesn’t sound like it is. She then proceeds to kick the ill girl out of the guest room, and continue to hook up with ex boyfriend. I lose my shit, kick them out of the house.

A text the next day asks how I’m feeling and asks for her earrings back. We have known one another for 15+ years with some drifting a part in between, but truthfully I’m too old for this behavior. I don’t even really want to hear her out because I would never in my wildest dreams consider treating someone’s home with such disrespect once, much less twice. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? No contact seems harsh logically but I have a history of poor boundaries and entertaining relationships with narcissists for far too long. I am getting so much better about my boundaries and who I give my energy to. I already feel healthier not speaking to this person. My question is this: how have you/do you dealt with people in your life who you do not feel safe and respected around?"|lizardbreath9819|False|https://redd.it/el0xdj|0|0.5|0|6|1|relationship_advice
el0xdg|2020-01-06 21:47:45|I (23f) don’t know if he’s (24m) interested but reserved, stringing me along or just bored|"So I went on a date with this guy before the Xmas period. He slid into my ig DMs and we hit it off from there before he asked me out to dinner. The date itself was really nice: we went to a restaurant and had a candlelit dinner, he queued up hours before to get us a reservation as this place is super popular which I thought was sweet. We got along well but I wasn’t sure there was any romantic sparks flying since he was not very forward with his flirting. My friends just think he’s very reserved and shy but I’m not so sure. 

Since then I thought that we weren’t going to go any further than maybe friends although I was curious about him. However, he still hasn’t made any feelings clear from his end. Off the top of my head the only signs he’s given was lots of eye contact, few brushes here and there, saying that I fit his type and he was sad we didn’t ‪spend more time together at the date. 

Now all he does since he came back from visiting family abroad is messaging me randomly about mundane, small talk that I find difficult to respond to. Just as I think he’s not interested and I let go of the convo, he comes back with something else. This time I went to a party and dressed up more than usual, but he responded to the story about the food I ate saying it looks tasty. I can’t tell if he’s simply bored or wasting my time or stringing me along. At this point I’m trying to create more engaging conversations like before but now I give up. I don’t know what he wants from me. 

How do I ask what his intentions are and essentially what he wants if it’s not a romantic relationship? I get some guys are very reserved and not very outwards about their attraction to a girl until they’re comfortable but it’s been however many weeks and idk if I want to carry this on anymore.

So now everyone is angry at his aunt and her husband.his dad and my mom and everyone else in the family have decided that his aunt and her kids leave the house and they should never come to the house again and the aunt should tell her husband to release my cousin from jail or they take the case to court.

I told my mom not to pay the money and force them to pay it since they are the ones that took it but she says if she doesn’t give the money this case won’t end but I think her giving the money will just cause a problem In the future because the next time they might do worse and everyone will expect that she would be the one to pay.

ekxloc|2020-01-06 17:56:40|My (26 f) sister (24 f) is being harassed by an abusive ex. What to do?|"Like the title says, my sister is being harassed by an abusive ex. They dated about 2 years ago and I could tell right away something was wrong with him because he had so many red flags, but my sister was very into him and my mom was also oblivious to it and openly welcomed him. I expressed that I thought he was bad news and was told I was being “jealous”. Anyways. 

They met and within one week he told her he loved her. He was OBSESSED. Wrote her letters, talked about marrying her after only 2 weeks, they moved in together in a month. He was 32 at the time and seemed very immature to me. He was also open about the fact that he was a recovered alcoholic. He seemed to have a hard time holding a job. Eventually she realized he was still drinking every day, and on top of that abusing Xanax and other pills. She broke up with him and he threw her into a wall and wouldn’t let her leave the house. Eventually she got out and went to my parents, who moved her stuff out for her, and that was that. 

He called her and messaged her obsessively for moths after the break up saying he loved her, he missed her, he was gunna kill him self, that he was doing better and quit drugs, etc. She moved on and got a new boyfriend and moved 4 hours away. Since then, he STILL messages her. She has him blocked but he makes new Facebook accounts and uses friends phones to contact her. He even messaged me and asked me to get her to unblock him and I told him to move on with his life. My family all his him blocked. 

He was arrested earlier in December for doing all of this to a new girl. He physically abused her, then stalked her and called her, and then threatened to kill her. He followed her to her women’s shelter and wouldn’t leave the parking lot. She pressed charges and he went to jail for only 10 days. An article was put out about him and his charges etc and apparently he has a very long history of charges including multiple assaults and stalking/harassment. 

He is messaging my sister using new social media accounts again blaming her for the article. Saying that it was all made up and that he’s actually engaged to this girl that pressed charges and that he’s gunna sue the papers (just straight up crazy, she had nothing to do with this). 

I’m worried he will escalate it and come find her. What are our options? Has anyone dealt with this? She went to the police before when they first broke up and they told him no contact but obviously it’s not working. He doesn’t care about the law, it’s not going to stop him and they don’t seem to take it seriously enough to keep him in jail. Her job requires her to have a large social media presence with her real name and I’m worried he will show up at her work, or follow her home from work, or who knows. Would it be best to report it or what to do? If she reports him he might snap and come find her.

Any advice would be appreciated especially by people who have some experience dealing with abusive ex’s. 

TLDR; my sister dated a guy who ended up on pills, drinking and abusive. They broke up and he stalked and harassed her. He was arrested recently for doing the same to another woman and he is blaming my sister for the chargers and an article about him.

Now apparently after trying being single and dating other people he decided he wants to be be with me and would do anything to win me over.

I have heard all this from his ex girlfriend who broke up with him because she caught feelings for her best friend and decided that me and him are much more compatible and “belong together”. So she’s trying to get us back together.

I will admit that I changed him a lot in good ways during the relationship and we are basically the same person in all ways but emotionally (he has always been more distant in that way).

Right now, we are talking in a friend kind of way but his ex tells me what he says to her about me and how he wants to be with me.

The thing is, I’ve dated around after I was with him and nothing feels the same as it did with him. I feel like out of everyone in the world besides my best friend, he knows me the best.

I don’t know what to do, should I talk to him or ignore him? Any advice is appreciated."|ttthhrow4wayy|False|https://redd.it/ekujob|5|0.75|0|10|1|relationship_advice
ekvoww|2020-01-06 15:37:44|My boyfriend (23/M) wants to get a vasectomy for me (25/F) and it's kinda freaking me out?|"TLDR; Boyfriend wants to get a vasectomy, freaks me out because of the short time we've been dating and how it's a permanent procedure. Thoughts?

He casually brought up he was thinking of getting the procedure done the other day whilst playing Pokemon as if it's something minor to discuss.

We've been dating for a little over a year now and live together and have talked about whether or not we wanted kids (we both don't) but even so, it freaks me out that he wants to undergo a vasectomy.

I asked him why, and he said he wanted me to not have to be on the pill because of the side effects it causes (harder to lose weight, loss of libido, etc) and since we didn't want to have kids, that he's fine snipping. He also added that he would do anything to keep me happy.

I mean, on one hand it's like wow, he really wants me to have a better quality of life and is willing to get a vasectomy to do so but on the other hand it's like such a permanent thing to do and... well, is it commitment issues if I'm a bit worried if later down the road, what happens if we separate? 

I'm currently happy in our relationship, but we're talking permanent procedures here-- I mean, we've only been together for a little over a year but he's okay to do something that'll affect him forever. To me, it's really sudden and honestly kind of makes me feel a bit trapped? Like, I'd feel guilty if he did this and later down the road our relationship starts falling apart. Not saying it would, but that possibility is there.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on this? I honestly don't quite know how to feel about it.

EDIT: Okay, from the responses on here, I realize that I didn't put something that might change one's perspective? I think I'm feeling these things because even though not having kids is a personal choice, he doesn't want kids because I don't want to have kids. He could swing either way. He also had mentioned that he would never do this for anyone else, nudging towards our history that if he wasn't with me that he would've committed suicide long ago. There's also emphasis that he'll do ANYTHING to keep the relationship together, which kind of makes me feel a bit flighty (but i'm generally a nervous person, so a lot of things make me feel flighty haha)."|KeikoKitty|False|https://redd.it/ekvoww|2|0.8|0|33|1|relationship_advice

el0qq5|2020-01-06 21:35:02|Why is he not adding me back on Snapchat?|"I (19f) have a slight crush on this guy (19) since about may this year. We don’t see eachother very often and only at parties, but when we do we talk and dance with eachother (we are more of aquaintances rather than actual friends)

So a few weeks ago was a Christmas party of one of our mutual friends. There was this mistletoe where everyone would give their friends a little kiss. Nothing wild. Without giving too much unnecessary information: me and my crush made out under it, but it wasn’t the type of kissing that happens out of heavy flirting and passion. It was more like surprising. 

Half a year ago I added him on snapchat but he never added me back. I was a bit sad but didn’t thought much about it. So when I got home from the party I sent him a friend request again. Just like before, he didn’t added me back. A few days ago I finally told my best friend how dumb I feel about this and she immediately added him on snapchat which resulted in him not adding her as well. I know for sure he uses Snapchat frequently, so I can’t pinpoint the problem.

Normally he is a very extroverted, direct and nice guy. So him just ignoring us seems unlikely. I can’t tell if he is interested in me, because he shows all typical signs of attraction to almost everybody. It’s not like he is flirting with everyone, it’s just his very friendly personality. (I know this sounds dumb, but I am not even sure, if he knows that he is way too affectionated to strangers) I’m even glad he didn’t added my best friend on Snapchat back because I was afraid he might have a thing for her. Now I am unsure of how much our kiss really meant because looking back, it seemed kind of platonic even though I don’t know if I am telling this to myself to not get my hopes up too high.

I would just ask him but we are both very busy right now and therefore don’t see eachother at all. I am pretty sure he has no clue I am interested in him, because I can seem kind of cold and uninterested or downplay affection due to my fear of not being liked by strangers.

Recently, he told me about some heavier mental health issues that were going on and he just needs to have his own time alone to sort it all out, and that’s totally fine and we make that work. I’ve been getting pretty lonely since I don’t get to hang out with him as much, so I joined a pretty large discord server to meet some new people. I talk on there pretty frequently, but I always make sure to check in with my partner to see if he wants to be alone or if he wants me to be there (we live together). He brought to my attention that he kind of feels like I might cheat on him because I’m always talking on that discord and he doesn’t know who they are or what I’m talking about. He wants me to start talking on there less, and he knows part of this is his own insecurities that he needs to deal with. I’m just not sure how to address this or how to deal with this since I don’t think I should be compromising how much I talk to people, but I don’t want to be disrespectful to my partner.

But when we get into petty arguements, like typical dumb arguements. She gets very emotional. For example, just last night, we got into an arguement about whether or not you can play guitar if you have long nails. It was a dumb arguement that should've just ended and we would forget about it later. 

But instead she got very upset, telling me that I never listen to her and that I'm an asshole. I genuinely had no ill intentions toward her and would never try to make her feel bad. I am a stubborn person, and I stand by my opinions, so I never agreed with her, and sometimes I joke around and have a little fun because I just think it's a dumb arguement and I dont take it seriously. But she takes it very very personally, going so far as even crying for a while and even not wanting to talk for extended periods of time. After the dumb arguement theres usually a fallout that lasts hours and she doesnt let it go and remains upset for sometimes close to two days. 

I just dont know what to do. I feel like such an asshole evertime and like I'm ruining everything. I always think theres something wrong with what im saying to her, or how im saying something, but after the many times of this happening im beginning to think theres nothing I can do.

ekxffq|2020-01-06 17:44:10|Teen daughter unsure of her sexuality|"If not the right sub, please delete!

My (30’sF) daughter (13F) and I have an amazing relationship.  She comes to me with anything and everything.

Recently she’s told me that she thinks she likes girls.  She’s mentioned it a few times before, but has become more adamant about it recently.  

I have 0 issues with her preferences, I fully support her.  I don’t want her to hide who she is.

She’s said that she thinks she likes girls, but she’s not 100% sure yet.  She’s even said herself that she might be attracted to girls because they are more mature in her age group and that might change as the boys mature too.  But she has friends that are more mature and she still finds them unattractive for the most part.  

What kinds of conversations should I be having to help her figure it all out?  Or is this something where I step back and listen? 

Lastly, I’m not sure how to bring this up, or if I even should...- I’m sure part of figuring this all out involves her talking about it with friends in her age group as they are all figuring out themselves too.  

But kids can be super mean.  I’m struggling with whether or not I should just take a 100% supportive stance and let her come to me whenever she feels she needs to, or if I should probe her once in awhile to see how figuring it all out is going for her.  So, do I shut up and sit back, or have a conversation about the negativity she may face and come up with plans for dealing with that potential negativity?

Again, I fully support her.  I don’t care if she likes boys or girls, or both."|vanillabeanmacaroon|False|https://redd.it/ekxffq|2|1.0|0|13|1|relationship_advice
el0nrc|2020-01-06 21:29:26|I think I need some help getting over a past event.|"Hi, I didn't really want to post this but nobody here knows me and there is no way anyone can identify me so I'm going to take a leap and ask for some help. 

A few years ago I was sexually assaulted. I can't seem to bring myself to say the R word, it just makes me feel claustrophobic. In fact, my chest feels really tight even typing this. I'm in therapy although we haven't properly spoken about it because I close down and get uncomfortable, and my therapist - god bless her - doesn't push me to discuss things when I don't want to/not ready to. 

The problem is it's taking a toll on my relationship. I'm engaged to a wonderful man, he is so kind hearted and lovely, I know he would never do anything to hurt me. However recently, maybe the last five months or so, sex hasn't happened because I seem to go into a panic attack and start crying. I'm not entirely sure why it is affecting me now, but it seems to be. I just feel dread and nauseous when I think of sex. (None of this my partners fault. He has never pushed me, always comforts me, respects my boundaries). We are very open and honest with each other, he knows why I find it hard and he respects that and doesn't push it. But I feel awful. I'm meant to be his wife soon, yet I can't even perform in the bedroom without panicking and crying? I know that is not my fault, but it makes me feel awful. My partner insists that it is NOT a problem and he is more than happy just cuddling, we show a lot of affection to each other daily - it's just sex that makes me tense up.

I'm just.... not entirely sure what to do? I know I need to discuss it to save a future meltdown most likely, but I can't seem to get the words out. I just go blank. I don't want to remember, I don't want to think about it, I just want to curl up and feel safe and secure and never think about it ever again. But I can't, I have to face this. Because as much as my partner says it doesn't bother him - it bothers me. It bothers me I can't give him what someone else could, it bothers me I can't function like a normal person, it bothers me that that disgusting low life took away something from me which I'm now having to deal with years down the line. 

I'm not even sure if this is the right sub to post in, is there anything I can do to try and get over this hurdle? To assure my partner I will beat this? Because I'll be damned if this is the end for me, I will not allow myself to be dragged down and to suffer because of someone else's actions.

Fast forward two months later, I'm already out drinking at bars and I get a message from her saying she'll might be in the area and we could meet up.. and we do end up meeting up and we had a great time at the bars from what she told me later. We were out from 3-10pm & didn't eat dinner so I ended up not realizing my limit and got blackout drunk.

She apparently took me back to her place. I have some recollection of what happened at her place.. I knew we weren't going to go all the way. From what I remember I only remember making out and kissing/sucking on her neck. And, then her getting upset and telling me to leave.

The next day I text her and she tells me I was kinda rough kissing her neck, and she texted me a picture and it was slightly red, not purplish hickey color and maybe size of a baseball. And that she tried to tell me to be gentle but I wasn't so she told me to stop and leave.. which I did. I genuinely apologized next morning for my behavior, and she did appreciate the apology and said she knows I'm a good guy, but said she wants some space now because her neck kinda hurts. I'm just really upset at myself and really turned off about drinking moving forward because of this situation. She was really an amazing girl and we were getting along really well. I'm really hurt by this and has been on my mind for a month now. We've been in NC for two weeks.

He drinks all the time but wont admit it. And even when I go to see him at work, he disappears with a colleague and comes back drunk. Hes gained a lot of weight in the last three years due to drinking and late night fast food and his snoring has become so bad that we sleep in separate rooms at different sides of the house and I have to wear ear plugs (I'm a light sleeper).

el0n5k|2020-01-06 21:28:16|Abusive, suicidal, money draining bf refuses to leave|I’ve been wanting to post about this for a while. I’ll try not to make it too long. A little over a year ago, I (28F) met my bf (23M) a few months after ending a one-sided relationship (35M). I am childfree, a feminist, and I used to do a little modeling. He presented himself as a very kind, positive, and ambitious person. I was very open about who I am and my expectations from the beginning. Although I didn’t want to rebound, after a few weeks or so, we decided to try dating. After he bought a house, and I figured out how insecure and controlling he actually was, I figured out that I needed to leave. I’m bad for being a feminist, owning my sensuality and not wanting children.  I couldn’t actually leave until I found someone that was willing to let me move in. The person that finally decided to help me was across the country. So, I packed my shit and drove across the country. I told him how he made me feel and that he needed therapy. 5 months into my celibate singleness, I decided that I was ready to try someone else. That didn’t work out, and maybe 5 days later, my ex contacts me and wants to see me. I say no, as I was completely sure and serious when I left. The next day, he says that he will leave me be, he just wants to talk one more time. Up until this point, he’s sent a few emails, some bordering on nasty. I ignore the nasty parts, as I know that he is in pain. I am genuinely glad that he says that he has a job and is thriving. He’s been  telling me about how he got “help” like I asked him to before I left and how he understood exactly why I left and that it was his fault. He’s casually sipping a beer of some sort. I decided to be cordial and ask him how he is and what he’s drinking. This is the only avenue I couldn’t figure out how to actually block him from, and I agreed to one more conversation, so whatever. His eyes gloss over, and he becomes disoriented and seemingly confused. I immediately think, “oh, fuck! What did he take before calling me?!” It takes a few minutes, but I quickly discovered that he took a lot of pain pills and was intending to die on video in front of me to hurt me because of how I hurt him by leaving/rejecting him. Being the kind and completely unselfish person I am, I didn’t want him to succeed next time, so when he begged to come back, I foolishly thought that maybe thing’s would be different. I foolishly took him back. I no longer let him gaslight and manipulate him, and I even become “cold” and tell him exactly what he’s doing and how I feel. Knowing that I will no longer fawn over him and trip over myself to fix the problem, he now resorts to this pitiful crying and calling me mean and heartless. I realized that my extremely caring nature made him see me as a soft target. Now that he sees that I’m not, I can tell that he’s trying to “break me down” until I am. I know the situation that I’m in. I’m just trying to find the best way out of it. Of course, I’ve considered the police, but he’s very smart. I know that I can’t just kick him out without a 30 day notice, and he knows that, too. I also don’t want him arrested if I can avoid it. I’m in my newly purchased house with him (that I bought, much to his disappointment, since it’s MY house and not HIS), and of course, I don’t have any family around the immediate area that can help me. He won’t hit me or destroy anything in my house, because he knows I’m waiting on that. He just throws tantrums and threatens suicide if I leave him. He constantly says “don’t give up on me, this is my last chance at life.” After his tantrums about my past (that had nothing to do with him) as well as my opinions, interests, and my sometimes being too tired to please him. Of course I CARE if he kills himself this time, but I know that I am not responsible for it. I’m sick of piece of shit people coming into my life, thinking they aren’t good enough for me because they put me on this pedestal, then abusing me when I can’t “fix” them or live up to their crazy standards for women. I gave up modeling and most of my friends due to his insecurities. I’m done with it, and now I’m a cold-hearted bitch because I don’t do everything right. He feels like less of a man because I’m taking care of everything, and that’s somehow on me and not him. I need to figure out how to get this guy to leave me alone for good.||False|https://redd.it/el0n5k|1|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice

I've been dating (now living together since 2y) this guy for about 4 years, at first things were pretty up and down. Me being depressed and thinking about/doing drugs sometimes took a toll on our relationship at first. Now it's fine and calm between us, (no longer do drugs and depression is somewhat manageable) we actually sometimes laugh about random things and goof around. However I feel like before I got into this relationship I was feeling much better somehow, like I wasn't drained all the time, like I could do what I wanted when I wanted with whomever I wanted.

He's a very nice and good, down to earth kinda guy though - caring, loving, driven, thinking about a future with me in it. His family is great aswell, very nice people, whom I don't want to hurt but might do, depending on what happens. Before I met him I was studying to get into uni and now I'm studying at uni. Loving uni but really missing out on uni life cus of where we live. I travel by buss 2h a day and want the opportunity to come and go as I want, when I want. Thinking about moving to the town I study in.

Before we moved in together we used to be very intimate and cuddly, which has changed since we moved in together. Atm I feel like intimacy is not something I'm interested in at all.  I have this feeling like our wave lengths and where we are in life don't add up anymore. I feel like our interests and hobbies don't align either, we do things separately and I think I want to share my hobbies with someone. Before this relationship I was single for a year, loved it mostly, and even before that I was in a 6y long relationship. Felt liberating getting out of it. I had my own things, friends, goals and adventures. Now I'm rather comfortable with the benefits of a relationship (money, housing, food, comfort etc) but feeling like I've lost myself along the way of being in them. The reason I wrote and started thinking about all this was cus of a school of life video I saw: when you feel stuck in a relationship - and I felt like it really spoke to me.....

I have been feeling like I'm stuck in life. I want the old feeling back: my life, my choices and all that. I have this feeling like I've been missing out on uni life a lot.. all its pros and cons. I want a place of my own, do things my way, go where I want without having someone depend on me. Unfortunately I don't have friends to went this to so here I am and I'm rather unsure on what this feeling is and what to ask for.. but despite all the good that is now - I love my guy but can't help to feel like this isn't what I want, not now.

Any advice on what to do or think would really help. Not sure if all this is ""just my depression talking"".. potentially throwing away something nice and stable."|loomedcitrusthrow|False|https://redd.it/el0mrf|1|1.0|0|0|1|relationship_advice

They were constantly in and out of each other’s lives though. She could never trust that his intentions were in the right place. Finally, they said they’d be willing to “try”. Most days things were good. Normal-ish. Almost 4 months in, he asks her for “pics” and she refuses. Says pics aren’t her thing and she’s not ready for it yet. He threatens to end the relationship bc of it. Out of anger and hurt, she ends the relationship and walks away. Blocks him on every thing and gave him no access to her.

Until 6 months later, they run in to each other. He profusely apologizes to her and wants to be forgiven. He says he’s changed, he’s matured. He made a mistake and he accepts and recognizes it. Things are different. Try again. He seems completely genuine and sincere. He seemed different but no way to know for sure. The connection they have is so strong. He’s sure the universe is bringing them back together over and over for a purpose. He says “you’re meant to be in my life at least to some capacity.” Is he afraid of telling her his true feelings or is he saying just enough to keep her around? 

Then he texts her very mundane messages. She replies once but not to the last text bc a response wasn’t needed. He doesn’t make any effort to text her he misses her or call her or talk to her after that. 

She is conflicted. Should she believe him or should she forget him for good?

el0lep|2020-01-06 21:24:50|Coworker Chaos|"I can’t make up my mind on how to feel about this situation. I don’t know if I’m over thinking, my anxiety is wreaking havoc, or if I truly am an asshole but here it is: 

I (25F) work for a small tool company (I am the receptionist)  where there is one main salesman, and one other guy who packages boxes all day and who has gone through training, is supposed to take phone calls/customers for the department when the main salesman is unavailable. Since the day I started working here, every time I ask this guy to help or take a phone call, he always huffs and says he’s too busy and to take the persons info, then never calls them back. Makes my job harder and makes the customers upset. He’s been here 2 years and since I’ve been here (9 months) I’ve seen him spoken to about his priorities needing to be first and foremost helping customers when they call, but he never listens and continues to avoid talking to customers at all costs. He does it constantly but I don’t say anything. 

Last week, customer calls and says he needs to talk to someone in sales, he has questions about his tools. The main salesman was at a doctors appointment, so I went to the other guy and told him to talk to the customer. As usual, he says he’s too busy and to get the customers info. I could tell just by talking to this customer that he was not going to like that answer. So I said “I really think you should take this one, he sounds like he really needs to talk to someone right now” which he replied “just get his info, if it turns into a big deal then I’ll talk to him.” So I turn to walk back to my desk, only for him to follow me back to my desk to stand there at my desk and WATCH ME ask the guy for his info. He didn’t have time to take the call, but had the time to follow me and listen in on the phone call. That’s what’s frustrating. As predicted, customer got upset and couldn’t believe that we only have 2 salesmen and the one that’s there is “too busy.” He was not happy. 

The head sales manager comes back from his appointment and I give him the customers number and told him to call him ASAP as he’s upset nobody could help him. Manager asks me “well why didn’t **** take the call?” I told him because he said he was too busy. This, understandably, set the manager off since he has had countless meetings already with this guy about this very thing. So he goes and I hear the manager give him a very stern talk. So now, obviously he thinks I went and bitched to my manager about him and be mad at me. 

Now here is where I’m at; already feeling like a bad enough person and like a tattletale (even though I didn’t necessarily tell on him, my manager specifically asked) and then I feel really bad about how he got a talking to, I wasn’t even planning on telling the manager, I usually just let it go, but he asked me to tell him. And now the guy is giving me a firm silent treatment and ignoring me and acting like a child but I still feel bad even though I know he brought it upon himself, but I also know how he feels and how this looks and don’t blame him. So I don’t know if I should be beating myself up or ignoring it and not caring..I just don’t know.

How do I proceed with the relationship?|"I kind of feel stupid for even having to ask for advice. We have been dating for 3 years. I am ready to take this relationship to the next level and get engaged and eventually have kids. I've even debated proposing myself but 1) I really want to be the one proposed to and 2) I'm not sure he would say yes as he also wants to do the proposing. When we talk about it, he says he expects pressure to get married but not ultimatums. I don't want to give him any ultimatums or force him into something he isn't ready for but my concern is....

Staying in this relationship and him never being ready... then having to meet someone new, date, get engaged, married, try for kids, etc. I would like kids sooner than later and wasting any time with the wrong person really scares me. He also wants to be married before we have kids.

I read this quote the other day and it said 'Decide if change or staying the same is scarier' and to be honest, being in this relationship 5 years from now, even one year from now and not getting what I want/need is scarier than leaving. Help/advice. Is this a 'clearly we want different things right now' type of thing?

ekuedl|2020-01-06 13:51:24|Relationship Advice Needed: Dog Conflict|"I (26 years old M) have been dating a girl (23 years old F) now for a year and 8 months. She told me after a great weekend that she was unsure about where our relationship stood. Among a few other arguments, her biggest one that she felt she was in a competition with my dog. I have a french bulldog who is about 1.5 years old and i've raised since 8 weeks old. My girlfriend simply asked, ""If it came down to it, would you pick me or the dog"". I told her the dog without any hesitation and further explained that I would default to the dog until an explanation of why the dog needed to go. I told her what I considered the OK to move on from the dog such as biting, doesn't mesh with kids, medical problems etc.. She felt that since her tolerance is lower of pets, that she would want the dog gone after something like diarrhea and that if the dog needed surgery for something (2,000), she'd rather the money stay in our accounts. I took massive offensive to this, but I told her that I am financially stable enough to handle emergency situations....she then argued why I don't put the money towards organizations, homeless people or her debt. I told her that I should be able to choose what I do with my personal spending from my personal account, which then she said she wouldn't be comfortable with. I then posed the question (when we have kids) if they wanted the dog to have surgery to an injury to keep it around, would you pay for it then? She said no, she would sit the kids down and explain why the dog isn't going to get it and how it would go towards their financial future.

I get why she would be upset from me telling her that I would choose the dog until an explanation is given, but am I the asshole for going as far as I can to defend my dog? I feel like it isn't a fair compromise for me to get rid of my dog when she was the one who encouraged me to get the dog in the first place. When I go to her place, the dog stays in her crate at my house, when she comes to my house she roams around until we go into the bedroom which then she goes into the crate.

I know some things you have to fib about a little bit, but I would have rather been open and honest to her.

The disagreement has me questioning whether our compatibility is strong enough for us to move in together and if I should date someone who is more into pets."|PreviousMidnight9|False|https://redd.it/ekuedl|6|0.84|0|10|1|relationship_advice

I have been going through a shitshow of anxiety and depression for the last 2ish years. 

Here's a chat exchange between us recently. 

Him: Look, I am not gonna sugar coat this. Stop being a pussy and stop this depression. I can't see you like this. And stop posting quotes on insta. (Referring to mental health awareness and support posts I would share in Insta stories)

Me: I appreciate your intent behind this of wishing me well but your way of talking is crass, offensive and derogatory.

Him: It's all in your head. Anytime I have been non-sugar coated, it seems derogatory to you, so it's all in your head.

Me: <shuts down>

&#x200B;

This is where I shut down. Anytime I have brought up an issue about something he said, 80-90% of the time he either denies it, deflects it or projects it on me. This 'its all in your head' was a whole new level of denying my reality.

How should I deal with this?

P.S.: In the past - he has said things to me like don't be a woman, or don't behave like a housewife by bringing up something that happened 2 weeks ago. Basically, he seems to equate being weak or vulnerable with being a pussy or a woman. These things shut me down and have prevented me from pursuing this further. BUT I am still too attached to him, not able to let this go. I want to pursue this, but I am afraid I can't get past this behavior.

TL;DR: Love interest sometimes speaks in ways that are derogatory or offensive and I can't get past it. IS this language acceptable? How could I deal with this / get past this?

The kicker is, she still lives there in my boyfriend's house! He let's her use his disney+ and other accounts, he cleans up after her, he refuses to go to friend of the court to work out a fair custody agreement. He has managed to get her parents to watch their child so I can have one (1) night a week with him. While she spends as much time as she wants with her new fiance.
 
He bends over for her constantly, and 1.4 years later I've only been to his house once. Not to mention any time I see him outside of our date night we are doing stuff together with his daughter. Which, I really care for her as well, but it's just beginning to feel like I'm just like some sort of side bonus companionship for him. 

I gave him a drawer and a key to my apartment. He doesn't even treat me like an important aspect of his life.

ekuad7|2020-01-06 13:41:44|My girlfriend [27F] seems to have two distinct modes and I [28M] don't know how to handle the constant switching|"My girlfriend and I have been together for almost a year and a half. We had a rough patch following our honeymoon phase ending between 3-8 months where I became very codependent on her and she became very resistant to supporting my anxious behavior. I've been in therapy for almost a year and can say I've made significant codependence progress, especially in the last four months, but I still get anxious here and there.

My girlfriend is an introvert and highly values her alone time, which I do my best to respect as a recovering codependent boyfriend. I've noticed in the last few months a progression of hers to having two very distinct modes that swap around with odds almost like a coin flip and sometimes multiple times a day:

1. Wants to hang out nearly every day, do everything together, needy and affectionate and sweet; says I love you proactively and calls me by any of our nicknames; is at least interested in sex (though nothing compared to our sex life before codependency issues)
2. Wants very little to do with me, either in person or via text. When we're together and she's in this mode, she does not want to be touched, never proactively says I love you, and absolutely does not want to have sex. When we are apart, her replies are short and infrequent. Occasionally she won't say I love you via text before bed.

Naturally, I don't like mode #2. It makes me uncomfortable and while I try my hardest to be respectful of her space and personal needs during these times, it's jarring to have her go from hot to cold so quickly. We just went on a 10 day vacation together over the holidays and she spent much more time in mode #2 than mode #1, which she later revealed was because she wasn't getting any alone time (she did not communicate this to me until we were back). Ironically, as we were saying goodbye at the end of the trip, she told me how much she was going to miss me and how much she loves me. We took three days off from hanging out after getting back and hung out for the first time again yesterday, where she was mostly in mode #2 and had absolutely nothing affectionate to say.

I'm not sure what to do or say. I don't find that me broaching this topic or similar topics to be very effective, especially after my issues with codependency where I commonly brought up things from a bad, anxious place. She is definitely still very sensitive to these issues of mine. Any advice would be greatly appreciated -- I want to do my best to support her without suffocating her but I myself am feeling a bit overwhelmed."|hotcoldyesno|False|https://redd.it/ekuad7|4|1.0|0|10|1|relationship_advice

I'm not one of those teens that are ignorant and go around the Internet hopping down the rabbit hole of just dating someone immediately right off the bat and sending nudes to some boy or random stranger thinking that they love me when we just met.

I actually really love my boyfriend to bits and pieces, we've seen our faces before and have our phone numbers and access to our social media accounts. We've been in a relationship for 14 months too. Not to mention that we always have been loving and affectionate towards each other while being there for one another even in our rough patches.

However, we plan to eventually meet each other in person when we can. Of course I'd love to see my boyfriend but I know that it won't be pretty if I explained that situation towards my mom.

If you want a bit of background as to why my mom is protective, I have been through a specific abuse at childhood from Five years old to almost Eleven years old from a family member,

And my mom has always kept a closer watch on me after I told her that since she was already keeping an eye out for that before I told her about it. To make matters worse though, as a teenager at the age of Thirteen I made terrible online friend decisions and dating ones and how I behaved. I told my mom a bit about my friends rather how I was which she sort of accepted since I told her,

But I did something stupid and inappropriate that no one at that age should do in a relationship. She almost caught me and had to make me tell her, I did tell her a little of it though but not what I was doing and that just made her very protective of me after that and she didn't want me talking to people online.

After this though, I've learned how to keep quiet about my online friends and how to hide it. At one point I was very lonely since I'm home schooled and moved away from my state, I even had no friends when I moved to my new state since it was new and my middle school from my old state sucked and I was too shy to even talk to anyone nor close so I had no contacts. Not to mention I had a toxic personality from the old friends I had surrounded myself with. So I had no one around me until I met my boyfriend while I was left in the void on a social media app and we talked.

He gave me the best time of my life too since I was struggling that time I was alone, both online and in real life. He gave me good friends that actually cared about me and that were there for me (even though they're not really active anymore), a grand time to be around them, and has helped me change my toxic self from back then to someone more caring now.

My mom didn't know any of this though and how lonely I was or how I've struggled, she's asked me a few times if I talk to anyone but I'd just lie to her. My mom is an amazing mother too so she just said okay even though she had a feeling that I was lying since of course I'm not good at lying, especially with my mom.

I hate it too because I don't like lying to her, yet I'm too scared to tell her. I've been more open with her recently because I've gotten closer to her and even told her how lonely I felt with online schooling so she's considering public school in the summer to see how it goes for me.

But I'm still nervous with my online boyfriend and friends since I know she's protective of me and there's a good 90% chance that she wouldn't accept it. I don't want my boyfriend to be taken away from me either once she finds out. 

If she ever does find out though, I have a plan set already to just be honest with her. I may not tell her everything since there's a lot of stuff I've done around the Internet, bad stuff even. But I'll be honest with what she wants to know. She's my mom and I love her. I understand why she's protective of me too and hopefully whoever reads this understands too, yet I know how to be more careful nowadays when being on the Internet than she thinks that I know.


But..

How do I go about this? Should I eventually tell her once I'm an adult and can move out and meet with my boyfriend? Should I tell her once I'm more closer to her and trust her more? I'd ask if I should tell her now but I'm too much of a coward to do that and I don't want my boyfriend or friends taken away from me. Not to mention it would obviously be a stab in the back to my mom because she loves me a lot and I'm sure she'd be devastated since telling her this would make her go back through all those times she thought that we were close.

If anyone has any advice, please give me some. I'd appreciate any advice I can get. I don't like lying like this to my mother and having to hide my relationship."|Minimango16|False|https://redd.it/el0dk5|1|1.0|0|3|1|relationship_advice

ekgnry|2020-01-05 18:14:41|My (19m) went nuclear on my dad over the idea of me potentially getting drafted due to all these WWIII memes|"**\*\*My (19m)** ***mom*** **went...** << Title clarification

This all sounds ridiculously stupid, but I am so fucking lost and it's driving me crazy, please just hear me out.

We live in the US, so news about the assassination of Soleimani and escalation between the US and Iran is obviously relevant to our family, however my parents have both immigrated from a different country and sometimes don't keep up with the news.

Yesterday, my mom first heard about this from some click-baity article from her home country talking about how anyone in the US who took out a student loan with FAFSA, which I did, is at risk of being drafted into ""WWIII"". My mom often does not understand how certain things function in the US, with selective service being one of them. My dad also wasn't very clear, and in all honesty, I wasn't either until I had to look it all up yesterday to try and calm her down.

Long story short, she blew up on my dad because she thinks he ""sold"" me to the US military for student loans, and I honestly think she partially convinced him too, because he usually tries to out-shout her when they get into ugly arguments, but this time he just stood back and he has been acting subdued and quiet ever since. I had to explain to both of them that all males who turn 18 are required to register with selective service, and that the FAFSA loans didn't factor into that (the connection being that selective service registration is a requirement for FAFSA). This all happened last night.

My mom is still angry with my dad even though there is no reason for her to be. Maybe even worse, she is acting like a war is imminent and I will be drafted by next week. She was legitimately sobbing the entire night, no matter how much I tried to convince her that she was over reacting. Now her eyes are always puffy and she is talking really monotone and shows no emotion, she's acting like I already died. I think my dad is taking it pretty hard too even though I emphasized to him multiple times that it's not his fault for having me take out a loan.

If this all sounds astoundingly stupid to you, that's because it is. But I don't know what to do. My mom is acting like she's spiraled into depression (she has put up acts in the past, I'm not sure how much of this one is real?), and my dad has just been really quiet lately. What the hell do I do to bring them back down to reality? I feel like I'm going crazy because they're getting so emotional over basic things that just aren't factually correct."|ThrowRA_grrlhsrhrsg|False|https://redd.it/ekgnry|140|0.89|0|65|1|relationship_advice

My aunt (mother's younger brother's wife) visited us yesterday and while I was in my room, she had a long conversation with my mother. Before leaving , she came into my room, sat on a chair nearby me and asked stuff about my education, and then suddenly changed the topic saying what do I think about her daughter. I couldn't think what to say, and next she said they have discussed to make her marry me, after finishing her exam in this year.

I know this cousin since young age, and she was like my own sister. I have never ever imagined her as a potential girlfriend. We had fun like any other cousins, and we text/call each other like friends, but now it's weird to see her in another view.

I said my parents that I can't marry her because she's too young and I only view her asa cousin. Mother tried to justify it saying it's a normal thing to marry a guy and his maternal cousin, she's the born one for me (after 10 years) and we match together; Also my uncle is very rich, and as she's his only daughter, I'd get a big dowry. I tried my best to make them understand that it is wrong to take decisions without asking us,but ""parents never do any harm and always take the best decisions for their child"" is the answer I got.

I don't know if she already knows this, and I don't want to make things weird by discussing marriage stuff with a schoolgirl.

el04g9|2020-01-06 20:52:28|[ThrowRA] My girlfriend (20) and I (23) are about to break up over a list of reasons, the problem is we genuinely love each other.|"The straw that broke the camels back:
I have a couple female cousins from different sides of the family. For whatever reason when I introduced them to my girlfriend last year(Christmas time 2018) they both seemed to ignore her and were kind of rude. It was a newish relationship and nobody had met her yet.

My girlfriend has pointed out weird behavior with one cousin who’s always coming around trying to sort of get my attention. That cousin won’t say hi to my girlfriend or will give a very stiff hello. If my girlfriend and I are sitting together she’ll come up and talk to me but basically ignore my girlfriend. 
I’m not going to say for sure she “likes me” because eww that’s my cousin, but I have noticed the way she treats my girlfriend. My girlfriend however is convinced. 

I’ve never done anything of the sort with ANY of my cousins. 

I rarely see her, she’s my stepmoms niece but my stepmoms sister is now getting married so she’s moving to the U.S. bringing my cousin along. 

My girlfriend is now uncomfortable because so far we just avoid holidays when she’s there but now that my cousin is moving here she wants me to talk to my stepmom about this. 

It just seems like a difficult conversation that I’m not sure I’m ready to take and my girlfriend noticed my hesitation. We’re now thinking about breaking up. 

Other background:
We moved quick after some issues with her leaving her parents as her parents were too controlling (Would take all her money, make her clean the house alone all day everyday, and basically just had her like Cinderella.) We moved in together at about 3 months into the relationship. We’ve been together for 2 years and 5 months. 

Some other issues we’ve had:
-I don’t do enough for her. The relationship feels 70/30 where she’s putting in most of the effort. (We talked about it recently and I agreed that I need to step up.)

-We’re both basically chronically depressed and previous fights have resulted in suicide threats. (I’m going to see a doctor this week.) (My girlfriend has attempted suicide when she was younger. Her parents didn’t bother taking her to a psychiatrist or a doctor. They just basically told her to suck it up.) 

-Financially neither of us is doing great, because of the rash decisions of running away compounded by my parents kicking her out and me following her to help her.  (This is a TL;DR.)

-Her family threatened to call the cops on me. When that didn’t work her family threatened to take legal action against me when she basically ran away (even though it had nothing to do with me.) When that didn’t work because I didn’t do anything, they threatened to come to my work and beat my ass. 

-My family never gave her a warm reception and frankly she believes that my family thinks that she ruined my life. 

-She caught me checking out another girl. (I checked her out for like an hour straight. We were at an event. I’m deeply ashamed and have tried to right this wrong. I don’t know what was wrong with me that day.) (I’m not a cheater and never will be, I was raised with morals.)

Because of that incident she became more self conscious and cut relationships with multiple of her friends she considered more attractive. She would FaceTime me randomly. She would check my penis. She would ask me if I’ve jerked off that day. She would check my location. When she would get home she would walk past me straight faced and check every inch of the house to make sure I wasn’t cheating. She would check my history and social media and deleted every female in my contacts. 
This resulted in my almost breaking up with her and she’s actually gotten better. She doesn’t do any of these things anymore. 

-Her older brother molested her for years. (She never told anyone. To this day I have to see this scum bag every time I go to her parents. Every holiday. Shake his hand. He doesn’t know that I know.) 

-We’ve both been trying to break our cycle of depression. We’re eating healthier, exercising, trying to be productive. Not letting each other stay in bed all day. But we both get offended talking about each other’s family. 

I love her but it’s all just getting to be too much. 
She loves me but it’s all just getting to be too much. 
We’ve been through so much, thick and thin. We’ve both been homeless, we’ve both been broke, we’ve been depressed together. We’ve both fought our families. We’ve fought each other. We know everything about each other. We’ve made sacrifices for each other. It feels like we’ve been married for 10 years. 

From everything that’s happened, this issue is what will tear us apart. She feels like I’m just letting it slide, and I mean... I guess I am. These cousins I see once every couple of years. They have no effect on my life at all. I don’t even keep in contact with them unless they’re in town. I don’t want to stir the pot as I see it as unnecessary. (Let’s just ignore her, it’s one evening.) It just feels hopeless that this stupid issue she can’t seem to let go will break us when we’ve been through so much more. She feels like I’m not fighting for her. Is this my fault? I have no control over the dumb shit they do. They don’t outwardly say anything to her. It’s just their body language she doesn’t like.

I think she is no longer interested in me and I am so committed and I the relationship I don’t know what to do.|"My GF and I have been dating for about 11m now. Everything past the honeymoon stage has been great right up until the past three or so weeks. 

Both my GF and I have been married previously. I got divorced about 7 months before we started dating. When we got together we both talked about how we wanted something serious. She wants to have a family really bad. She is also Lebanese and I am White but I converted to Islam about two months ago. We actually met because I went with my friend to the local Mosque so I was looking to convert prior to dating her. 

Obviously her family doesn’t know about me because it’s still taboo to date in her religion even though what she has told me about her family they are pretty liberal compared to most Arab families. 

She had some crazy ex BFs since she was divorced. She had a random number text her three months ago and she asked me to text them because they said “Hey gorgeous I can’t wait to see you soon”. She didn’t know who it was (found out later It was her ex). I made the mistake of saying I was her BF and he sent me so many horrible text messages and tons of sex pictures and videos she sent him when they dated. (Keep in mind she has never sent me a single one, I’ve asked a few times but it was never a big deal to me until then and she hasn’t since)

Some examples of his texts

“She was a high paid escort in Miami and that’s why she had to move” 

“She robbed her first husband of all his money and then divorced him” 

“She is a whore who sleeps with multiple guys and manipulates them into taking care of her” 

“She told me you can pleasure her sexually and that she can’t wait for me to come fuck her when you leave”


Stuff like that. We resolved the issue and until about last week he was never mentioned again. Anyway over the last three weeks she has seemed pretty distant to me. 

She rarely responds to my texts and if she does it’s not the usual nice responses. Instead of “Thanks Babe 😘” I get thx. 

She doesn’t want to sit next to me on the couch any deflects all attempts for us to have sex or cuddle. She won’t kiss me but let’s me kiss her. Locks the bathroom door when she takes a shower now. 

She had a friend of hers who is a guy text her the other day if he could come over and hang out - (he like most of her friends doesn’t know about me because he knows her family) she said no but texted back “‘very soon or I’ll come hang at your place 😘”

She texted him that when we were lying in bed and I guess she thought I was asleep but I saw it. I brought it up the next morning and she said it’s not what I think it is. 

Her ex is now back in the picture. He sent her flowers with a “Happy Birthday” card. Her birthday is the 2nd. I also sent her flowers and she posted both on Snapchat but idk. Considering she cried for a whole night because of all the evil things he said about her I would have thought she wouldn’t accept anything. 

Anyway I used my Mac this morning and she was using it last night. Her Facebook Messenger was open and it had a brief convo with him. He was blocked previously btw. 

“Thanks for the flowers”

“You’re welcome, you deserve the best”

“I’ll see you soon, maybe next Friday” 

So yeah. I have no idea what’s going on, if I did anything or if it’s even fixable but I don’t feel about my relationship right now.

Also we live together, have a one bedroom lease together and our phones are together."|thermosbbq|False|https://redd.it/el02ed|1|1.0|0|0|1|relationship_advice
eks7dr|2020-01-06 10:13:48|My (25F) close friend (29M) confessed to me because his friends pushed/forced him to and now everything is weird|"Some background info: our friendgroup consists of 4 guys and 2 girls including me. We're all 25-30yo. I visited them every other weekend (1h drive) while they all live together in 1 house and split rent. For convenience sake I'll use some fake names to explain it. 

I met Chris (29M) in May 2019 through a mutual friend and we hit it off. We became pretty close and through him I met his friends/housemates: Stan (30M) and Arnold (28M) are his best friends. Then there's also a couple,  Wayne (26M) and Nelly (25F). I'm closest with Chris, Stan and Arnold. Nelly is lowkey a bitch and I never liked her and it appears to be mutual. I barely interact with her.

Since 2 months or so, everyone (except Chris) suddenly started making jokes about me and Chris dating/having sex. It came out of the blue and made me very uncomfortable. This would happen several times a day and I usually stay from Friday evening until Sunday afternoon so I got a lotttt of jokes. I couldn't even enjoy eating a sausage with everyone without them saying shit like ""I bet you'd wanna taste Chris' sausage"". Just so you know, I find Chris extremely unattractive physically but also personally, I feel 0 romantic interest whatsoever. I made this clear a million times, but nobody believed me and kept picking on me. They never directed it directly at Chris though, always at me.

Needless to say, it felt cringey and uncomfortable. A few days ago I made a group chat and texted everyone but Chris about this. I told them it seriously makes me uncomfortable and I want it to stop. They apologised and said they won't do it anymore. An hour later, Chris texts me saying they won't make inappropriate jokes anymore. Then he follows up by saying he has feelings for me. I told him I appreciate his friendship but I feel nothing beyond friendship and he accepted this.

Another hour later, Stan texts me asking if I'm okay and that I can talk to him if I want about everything. I asked him if everyone knew about his feelings for me, they did. I asked if that's the sole reason why everyone started making those extremely uncomfortable jokes. Yes, it was.

For some reason, I felt betrayed. Everyone was in on it and despite me telling them ALL several times that I have NO feelings at all for Chris, they kept doing it for months. When I asked why, Stan said he's been in Chris' position before where he really liked a girl but never ever confessed and now he deeply regrets it. He said he didn't want the same to happen to Chris since they're close so he wanted to push him to confess to me. I wasn't as mad at Stan and Arnold because their teasing was ""appropriate"", as in not sexual and they didn't really make jokes often. It was mainly the couple, Nelly and Wayne, who went waaaay over the line and made the most disgusting, sexual remarks. This made no sense to me, they aren't particularly close to me or Chris so why would they participate in it? A part of me thinks they did it just to fuck with me because they never liked me and knew it made me uncomfortable.

I told them all in a group chat that I found out they all did it on purpose and that I need to gather my thoughts so I won't visit them this week and left the group chats I was in with them. I talked to Chris about it and said I might visit again in 2 weeks when everything has sunk in and I can think more clearly.

Is it wrong to feel so betrayed? I feel like I'm exaggerating. I was ready to cut all ties with them, but then one of my closest friends (not in this friend group) told me I'm exaggerating and that they were just teasing me to help Chris. I'm just not sure if everyone's intention was as pure. Especially with Nelly I've had so many moments where she was being a fucking cunt but I held back and said nothing to avoid drama because everyone had to kick out a real asshole recently. Nelly and her BF are the ""replacements"" of the guy they kicked out. 

Anyways, I don't want to lose them so I'll probably visit them again. But I have no idea how to act towards everyone. I hate acting like ""nothing happened"". Should I bring it up when I visit? Should I just let it be? And if I feel too uncomfortable being there, would it be a dickmove if I stopped visiting them?"|Tukbii|False|https://redd.it/eks7dr|7|0.75|0|2|1|relationship_advice
el01ez|2020-01-06 20:46:42|I (25f) can’t get over one night stand boy even though I have a wonderful new partner.|"Before me and my partner got together I had two one night stands (a year apart) with a boy who I think about regularly. We have lots of mutual friends but I rarely see him - maybe twice a year. He has a girlfriend who is lovely and who I’ve met and really get on with. Me and my boyfriend are having so much fun and he is f*cking wonderful but I find myself thinking about one night stand boy (ONSB) a lot, although less when I’m around my bf. ONSB was the first person I had sex with after a long relationship with the person I lost my virginity to - might that be the reason? There is no way we’d ever be together in the current situation and I don’t even know if I’d even like him if we ever did date. 
I don’t know if I’m just overthinking this - it might be totally normal to want one night stands to think you’re cool & to think about them & what they think of you. Am I looking too much into this?

el001r|2020-01-06 20:44:02|My girlfriend said she was raped by her Brother in Law. Found out they have a past, and she lied about it.|"This whole situation is a mess. I am in shock and don't know what to think or believe anymore. My girlfriend and I are currently long distance, she moved back to her hometown after living in my city for a year, which is where I met her. After she moved back, something terrible happened to her. Her BIL we will call Mark, sexually assaulted her. She was staying the night in her sister's house I'll call her Susan, after a wedding and the Susan went to work. My girlfriend (call her Beth) was sleeping on the couch when Mark started fingering her. Another bizarre detail, his kids were on the couch at the time. She didn't tell anyone including me for months. She finally told me and I immediately told her she needs to go to the police or I will. She threatened to lie to the police if I filed a report because she wanted to do it on her own time. For detail, her sister is her idol and she LOVES the kids (they have 4). She knew it was going to ruin their entire family and wanted to find a way to do it delicately. She has a huge and very tightly knit family and she wanted to find the right way to do this without traumatizing the kids and ruining her family. I still pressed her to tell but she eventually told Susan on her own.

But I was shocked when my GF was sending me screenshots of susan being mad at HER. I was confused, why would she be mad at you if you were asleep? She didn't do anything wrong? There were a lot of very strange details i didn't understand. I am ashamed to say I was having doubts about her story at this point. I have never been in a situation like this and couldn't fathom the whole thing, so I struggled to understand some things as I don't know how I would have reacted. At some point I asked her a very difficult question and asked if her and Mark had a history that would have caused him to think that she would be okay with him touching her. She said no. (that part is important) However, I was shown texts and screenshots that completely convinced me that this happened exactly how she said. (Texts of Mark begging Beth for mercy and not to tell. Saying he's sorry and that he has a problem and needs therapy. Texts from susan to Beth saying he admitted it and believes beth, she is sorry etc.)

Months go by and things are okay, except for the fact that Susan has accepted Mark back into her life, they still live together, and no matter what I said, the police were never notified. I pressed for this non stop but figured once the word gets out that there is no way somebody won't be calling them. Either way, Beth has coped and seems to have moved on, things are great.

Today Beth was over at Susans house spending time with the kids. She always leaves before Mark gets off work. This time, Mark pulled up as Beth was leaving and gave her a note and started crying apologizing for everything. Naturally me and Beth were talking about the situation later and she was so happy and said he was so sincere and his apology was very nice. I asked how she could forgive her rapist so quickly and that I would still never be, or want her to be in the same room with him. We started to get in an argument and I shouldn't have said it, but I again asked if Mark and her ever did anything in the past that may have complicated this situation. She said they had sex when she was 16.

It was at a party at Susans house and she claims everyone was very drunk and while she was in the guest bedroom going to bed, Mark came in and got under the covers and they had sex but she remembers none of it. So she lied about this months ago when I asked. I asked if her sister knows and at first she said Mark told her after this all blew up, then she said no she told her herself. I said then how if you don't remember it happening at all how did you think to tell her now? Or if he told her and you don't remember it happening then why didn't you deny it? I never got an answer to that question. I saw texts from Susan asking Beth the exact same questions and even claiming it couldn't have happened before she was 18 because of the house they live in. Also Mark saying that Beth initiated and that Susan believes him.

I am lost and don't know what to think. I feel like a terrible person for even questioning to begin with, but I had a gut feeling in the beginning that something didn't make sense, and now I know that she lied to me about it at the time. She says nothing has happened between them since. Knowing that my girlfriend may have consciously had sex with her sisters husband and lied to me about it, then this, seems like I am learning things about her and her morals that I did not know. Is this whole mess of a situation a deal breaker or is there a way to work through this? Am I in the wrong?"|ThrowRA3948579238742|False|https://redd.it/el001r|1|1.0|0|13|1|relationship_advice
ekzzux|2020-01-06 20:43:41|My friends and I are growing apart from each other, and I don’t know if it is a good thing or not|"I have a group of friends that have been with me almost all my life because we have always been in the same school. When we went separate ways after starting college, we rarely hung out and a lot of problems came from that. We fought all the time bc everyone thought no one took the effort to mantain contact (which is true), and this produced a lot of tension in the group. To add to this, because everyone was kind of upset with each other, it made it easier for old problems and resentment to spring right up. Frankly, i love them bc i have spent a lot of special moments with them, but I have heard a lot of hurtful comments and actitudes that kind of put me down. Even when we manage to meet up, everyone fights and we don’t have a good time. 
So, everyone is in a new part of their life where we as a group aren’t part of it. Even I have made new wonderful friends that i feel treat me a lot better. We don’t see or talk to each other, and when we do, all we do is fight. 
I don’t know if we should leave everything as nice memories before we start to truly hate each other. Or if we want to keep being friends, how would we fix this situation?  I just don’t know what i should do (and even if I did, i don’t know how the others will respond to my effort)

ekzzhz|2020-01-06 20:43:01|how do i support my ex who is now my friend?|"me (19f) and my bf (19m) broke up a week ago because of an issue that kept popping back up that we couldn't resolve. basically our needs weren't fully being met in the relationship and we decided to break up. it was amicable and we still stayed friends. right now neither of us are looking for any other relationships and just want to focus on our own lives and improving ourselves, so we basically said that if the other just needs someone because they're feeling lonely or whatnot, then we'd be there for each other. so like a few days ago i was at his place and we cuddled but that was it and it was nice. we were also talking about how weird it was that we might not have better sex than the sex we had with each other and he said ""hey i'm still down to smash if you want, or even if you just want to cuddle"".  so it seemed like we were on the same page and agreed that the break up was for the best because this was just an issue we couldn't compromise on and we just weren't the best match as a couple, but we still supported each other.

honestly this past week has been nice. the first few days were hard because even though i knew i still had him, it hurt to lose my boyfriend but now i kind of feel really relieved we broke up. i really care about him and love being around him, but i guess i just feel like i was settling too much. like i mistook really enjoying someone and the feeling of being in love to mean that this was the person i should be with. i know that deep down in my heart we are not meant for each other. i think we can be very good friends for a long time because we connect very well, but i feel like there's another guy out there for me who is a better match romantically, and i feel like there's another girl for him too that he would be much happier with and can fulfill all his needs. i feel like the truth is that we do have a great connection, but we were maybe both just lonely and desperate for love and we settled on each other. i don't want to say i never loved him because there were times i was so madly in love and so happy, but now that we've been broken up for a week, i feel less of those strong romantic love emotions and more of a ""i care about this person and want to see them happy"" kind of love. 

he's been talking in a way recently that hints that he wants to get back together and then just texted me that he misses being with me and still loves me, and he can't get over me. this is breaking my heart because i know we were really in love not too long ago, but i just don't feel the same way anymore and i feel so bad about that. i know he's going to blame himself and think less of himself but i truly do think he's amazing, i just realized he's not the one for me and that's why those feelings are fading. i also feel like those feelings of love were stronger when i was in the relationship and maybe i convinced myself of stronger emotions then because i was with him all the time but now that we're apart i feel it less... idk how to explain it, i just feel guilty. i told him i just don't think we were compatible enough in a relationship and that we're better as friends and he said ""ok, sorry, i hope you find someone better"". it's not that he's not good enough, it's that we're just not the right match and it took a lot to realize that but he keeps just turning it into a self pity thing and he thinks he fucked up the relationship by not being what i wanted or wanting things he wanted that i couldn't give him, i don't know what else to say to him. no one was right or wrong, we just weren't meant to be a couple. 

if i'll be honest, my true honest feelings regardless of what he's told me, i don't think he truly truly loves me the way he says he does, i think that i am the first girl he's had the most feelings for and maybe the first healthy relationship he's been in and he's convinced himself that he can't do any better than this because he doesn't deserve absolutely everything he wants, so he's just settling for not the worst. i know he'd deny this but it's truly what i feel when he says i love you to me now. i know he's got his insecurities and i hate to see him like this especially because of me, i just really want to help him realize what his true feelings are so he can lead a true life instead of just settling, but he seems adamant that he doesn't deserve anything and that no one will ever love him again or something. how can i support him? i really can't stand to see that i'm hurting him, he's my best friend and i care about him..

tldr; bf and i broke up but remained good friends, he wants to get back together but i don't and now he seems upset and i want to support him and show him that he will find a better match for him but he doesn't believe it and i don't know how to be there for him and not make him sad"|kitkatapplesauce1234|False|https://redd.it/ekzzhz|1|0.67|0|3|1|relationship_advice
ekzzbb|2020-01-06 20:42:36|How do I (33f) know if to end the relationship with my partner (31m)?|"My post got deleted so here I go again:

&#x200B;

So, it's really hard to write this. I already feel sad and guilty just thinking about writing what I am about to write.

I am in a relationship with a super kind man. It's been nearly 8 years now. We met online. After a year of long distance relationship he moved to my country and in my apartment - just for me. We had so many plans!He's a super introvert. I am a super extrovert. When I first met him in real life, I knew he wasn't someone I would have given a chance if we met ""normally"". But as we met online and talked for about 3 months before meeting, I knew him and I gave him a chance and fell in love with him. Even though it took a while. For him ist was totally different. He says he saw me and was blown away.

He stayed with me for four weeks before returning to his country. Back then I was 25, 4 years single and had 1 ex boyfriend. I was never the kind of person who was desperate to find someone. I enjoyed my single years. I dated, I had heartaches and I was the cause of heartaches. As soon as someone wanted a relationship, I blocked off. I was afraid. I guess also because my 1 ex was horrible and always made me feel uncomfortable about myself.

Anyway, the fact that I met my bf online is the reason he got a chance. One could say he sneaked into my life. We understood each other. We both had horrible childhoods. That connected us. We shared the same humour.

I also need to mention that I was always a bit of a ""Monk"" (tv series). I was too tidy. My mum always said she was afraid to touch anything in my apartment because she could make something dirty. I know it was too much. But I just feel comfortable in a clean and tidy surrounding. Even though I am not a minimalist.

So, my bf moved in with me. He's the total opposite. In the past 7 years we're living together now, I guess 80 % of the time we lived in a horrible dirty house. Things everywhere on the floor. The kitchen disgusting with loads of food rotting in the sink. I guess I just gave up at some point. He has a lot of food issues, so he cooks. He's a great cook, but a super dirty one. Food on the floor. Everything full of oil. The sink full of leftovers. And then he doesn't clean it. I stopped cooking just because I couldn't stand being in the kitchen. I just resigned. Then I always had a full time job. I was super exhausted in the evenings. My bf didn't work but also didn't tidy.

After 1 year he found a half time job. I always drove him the and picked him up again. He didn't have a driver's license. So I worked but also drove him around. He comes from a very poor background so I was used to pay for everything. When he worked night shifts, I also drove him then. After two years, he couldn't work anymore because he injured his back.

I found a new job. We moved. That job turned out to be super stressful. I came home in the evenings, my bf (unemployed) had always dinner prepared for me. He is such a kind soul and loves me extremely. I think he loves me more than I love him. He's also very clingy and I am not. But I guess that's also because I am the only person he has. He doesn't have friends here. He doesn't want friends here. Anyway, the first months we lived in an empty apartment because he couldn't manage to paint the walls. Even though he was home all day long. We can't get spontaneous guests, because I don't want to let them in. I am ashamed. When I was alone it was normal for me to invite people. I know I am mixing my thoughts, but I guess you'll get the point. So, he finally found a job. A full time job. For the first time. I was so relieved because we finally didn't have money problems anymore. You can imagine because I was the only one with a full time job. So, I was happy. I thought the bad years are over. But then, after only a month in that job, he broke down. He fell into huuuuge depression, That was in November 2017 and since then he doesn't work. I am, again, the only supporter. In addition I do all the paper work, all the thinking. I also do everything for him, because he still doesn't confidently talks my language. After 7 years in this country. He understands everything. He can talk it slowly. But he can't have a conversation. He just shuts off.

Right now he's in rehab for his mental state. The apartment is clean. I feel comfortable. But I know it'll change. I was hoping he'll get better there but it's the opposite. He calls me every day telling me how horrible he feels. I does put me down. I feel sorry for him, but I also think something MUST change. I am 33. Of course I hear my biological clock ticking. I often feel more than a care taker instead of a girlfriend. When we kiss, I feel nothing. He wants sex, but I don't. Even though in the beginning we couldn't get enough. I was hoping he will get better, but I know nothing will have changed when he comes back. I don't see a future. And that makes my heart ache. I am so fond of him. I don't want to hurt him. If I was to breakup, he would lose everything. His home, his future, his hopes. I guess he'd have to move back to his country. I know he could move to his dad and step mother, but it's the town his real mother lives and I know she's a major reason for his depression. We don't have contact to her. She cut him off, She's a devil. How could I do this to him? I am crying whilst writing this. I think of all the nice memories we have together. So many. But it is so so hard for me. His sickness and my stressful job lead to a burnout of myself. I am on sick leave since September last year. I hated my new boss, I hat loads of stress at work. And then I come home into a dirt hole, to someone who needed all my strength. I just couldn't anymore. My body just stopped last year. I couldn't take all the responsibility anymore. But then I think I can't leave someone for being sick. What an a\*\*hole would I be?! It's not his fault. But I feel that I can't anymore. It also makes it worse that every single person in my surrounding (family and friends) is telling me since years to break up. That he's no good for me. That I don't need to take the responsibility for his life. I am thinking of ending it since years every now and then. But then I get my hopes up again. He still makes me laugh. He is such a good person. I know it would crush him if I would leave him. I know that he feels totally different about our relationship. But I also know that his view is totally different. His family likes me. I provide for us. I do everything for him. I drive him around. He has a driver's license sine 2017 but still doesn't drive. It is too much for me. There were occasions when I wasn't fit for driving. When I was exhausted. And not even then he tried it. Everything is on me. But then I think he cooks for me. He cares for me that I stay healthy. I don't know what to do. How could I do this to him? How would he get his belongings to his country?! What if he doesn't find someone again (due to being madly in love with me, being heartbroken in that case and being an introvert). He wants children. What if I steal that from him? He doesn't deserve it. He had such a hard life. He doesn't have contact to his mother and sibling, because they cut him off. The mother is a psychopath! His twin sister is influenced by that horrible person.

For me it would be different. I have family and friends. I have support. He doesn't. My sick leave money stops in two weeks. I am applying for work even though I don't feel ready. I feel done. But it has to be done. We need money. I told him he needs to find a job. Today he called me that he won't do a labour job anymore, he can't. He doesn't have education for a proper job. He studied but didnt finish it. In my country you need to have studied or had to have an apprenticeship to be qualified for a good job. He has no choice but to do hard work, But I also understand why he doesn't want that. But now again. It is up to me. I don't feel able to return yet. But I will anyway. It has to be done. So I do it. Again. Me.

I know there's much more I could write but my head is just done.

I forgot: In the beginning I mentioned that I enjoyed my single years. I forgot to mention why I wrote that. I had sexual partners, with some of them I had feelings but there were only one night stands. I guess about 9 men if that's important. My bf doesn't know of that. He knows of 3 and already thinks that to be lots. I know he thinks girls are sluts when they have one night stands. But I don't regret it. I don't think it makes me a bad person. Of course it wasn't necessary but it happened. If he would know that he would think less of me. Even with those 3 he said back then that I am not the person that he thought I was. But I think everything that happened in my life made me the person I am. I would never ever cheat on him. I think I am a good hearted soul. A good person. I am kind and polite. But I know how he thinks of women with lots of exes and or sexual partners. If it was for him he'd be my first one.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: I don't know if to break up or not. 8 years relationship. He's a kind soul, I care for him lots. But is that enough? Don't know how to write it otherwise."|ThrowRA_way202020|False|https://redd.it/ekzzbb|1|1.0|0|0|1|relationship_advice

She told me that she didn’t know if she would be loyal to me but after she left we continued to talk and love was the same. Talking every day on the phone and texting. We also made plans to move together in another country in the future. She was confused and in a fase when she could focus on a relationship but been into this full emotional and committed.

Before people say it’s because she’s hotter then my gf everyone thinks my gf is the prettier sister. NOT BOASTING JUST GETTING THAT COMMENT OUT OF THE WAY NOW I NEED ADVICE. I’ve always found her sister pretty, sometimes attractive but not more then that. She went away for a year and came back and she looks the same but for some reason, I can’t get her off my mind sexually. I don’t know what it is but I want to fuck her sooooo bad. I see her ass in jeans or sweats and I automatically start thinking of taking her to a spot and doing her. I love my gf for sure she’s the one ima be with forever. But damn I think about her sister all the freakin time. I tried masturbating to her and only her for like 4 days straight to maybe get it out of my system but nope I still want to freakin fuck her! I don’t know what to do I see her very often and I find myself going to the bathroom to jerk off to her. TLDR want to fuck my gf’s sister what to do?|thrwaway-2020|False|https://redd.it/ekwpxg|2|1.0|0|4|1|relationship_advice
ekzwji|2020-01-06 20:37:30|Do you or your partner ever “ghost” each other?|"Let me explain what I mean. Sometimes I debate this in my head and think perhaps I just don’t know what a normal relationship looks like because with my ex, I basically became attached to him from the moment we met and spent almost every day together. 

Anyways, my boyfriend has autism. He’s extremely high functioning but he does have moments of burn out. He also says he is depressed and anxious because he hasn’t been doing as well in school as he would like to.

For months, we had been dealing with a huge rough patch. We broke up with no contact for about 3 weeks - but it was all communicated and boundaries were established. Anyway, I just wanted to set some small background. One of the reasons we argued a lot is because I felt unloved because he could go without speaking to me. Anytime I brought it to his attention, he would apologize and say that he was overwhelmed, that he didn’t want to speak to *anyone* and so on and so forth. The problem about me is that I tend to bottle things up so when I do bring it up, many times I’m unreconcilable for a bit. I just cry and cry and he always asks what he should do and we just end up talking until I am able to gather my emotions. I’ve realized this is a huge problem and have been working on my emotions. Now I have been able to speak without crying, or bring something up when it hurts me before I “explode” 

On Saturday, my boyfriend found out he wasn’t going to get the job he wanted. It was a normal job but he’s been stressing about money so I know he is really bummed out about it. In fact, he was being really restless. I was with him that day, and asked him a few times what was wrong, that it seems like something is on his mind and he said nothing was wrong. Finally, when it was time for me to go, I told him it was obvious he wanted me gone since he was so restless and that if he needed me to leave, he should’ve just said so. He clarified that it wasn’t that, but that he was thinking about how he didn’t get the job and that he wanted to figure it out on his own. I explained that he needs to at least validate me when I ask “is something wrong” and simply say “I’m bummed, I need some time alone” rather than just say nothing is wrong and then an hour later ask me to leave, as I have anxiety and we are still rebuilding from our rocky months. He understood, I left, spent time with my girls, and thats it. 

We did not talk the rest of Saturday, Sunday, and we have not talked today. I’m not sure if we even will talk today. And that brings me to this question. He’s not “ghosting” me, as I’m perfectly aware that if I were to FaceTime him right now, he’d answer. But, he does not reach out to me. I feel like if I don’t reach out to him, we won’t talk ever again. Now, that theory could just be my anxiety but my question here is, how normal is this behavior within couples? Am I justified to feel like he should check up on me - or maybe I should be checking up on him? (I guess my pride is showing) 

I don’t know. I’m telling myself to be patient, to be understanding, that he probably just needs some down time, but I also sometimes feel “abandoned.”  I would also tell him that if he ever needs time alone, that some communication about it would be great. But he doesn’t really do this, unless I end up confronting him about it."|lambocat|False|https://redd.it/ekzwji|1|1.0|0|3|1|relationship_advice
ekjjim|2020-01-05 21:47:26|Wife is adamant that she wants a third child. I do not want a third child.|I am in a bit of a bind…. My wife and I are both 37 and have two young children, a girl and a boy. We love them more than anything. The current situation I am in is that in the last six months my wife has done a complete 180 on wanting a third child, my wife feels that she is not done having children and wants to get pregnant again after seeing multiple friends of hers having their third children. I come from a family of three kids and my wife comes from a family of four kids. Even though I grew up with three kids in my family I see how hard it is to raise children and how expensive it is. I luckily work from home and make a good living and my wife makes substantially more money than I do ,but works in NYC and travels quite a bit for work cross-country due to her work in the media...which would make me the only parent that’s constantly around. I don’t mind it at all… They are my children after all ...but adding another child to the mix when my wife is on the west coast or somewhere else for multiples i days at a time seems ludicrous to me. Another issue is that’s had to do iVF for  both children, which means that we would be needing to do it again. I of course would not be going through it physically but I just feel like so many of these factors make it a bad idea overall. The biggest factor of all is raising and paying for  a third child when we have two kids that we love more than anything.|DeaconBlues5150|False|https://redd.it/ekjjim|63|0.88|0|25|1|relationship_advice

We were really good friends before and after talking/being together a lot we both wanted more. We’ve been together about 2 months now and I’ve started to see these things happen. I really don’t know how to approach it so I hope you guys can tell me. 

When ever I text her it takes a ridiculous amount of time for her to text back (sometimes almost 5 hours) and she always says “sorry for the late reply, I’ve been really busy” and I always say it’s fine. This always makes me feel like she doesn’t want to talk to me or that she would rather be doing something else. I don’t know what she’s doing. I guess it may be because of the holiday period but this has been happening before then. I don’t really want to talk to her about this because she’s always really sensitive about topics like this. Also, I’ve found we’re having less and less one to one conversations as she is avoiding me more/just not talking to me at all. 

Additionally, recently she has almost been blocking me out from conversations with our friendship group and never talking to me. It always seems like she is more happy to be with them instead of me. Like she’s always energetic around my friends then as soon as she’s alone with me she’s the opposite. 

Please help me as I’m in a really bad place rn and this is all effecting my mental health. Thank you for reading this far and please give some advice"|DirtyMoonShip|False|https://redd.it/ekzw2d|0|0.5|0|1|1|relationship_advice

ekzv8i|2020-01-06 20:34:57|How to determine if divorce is the way to go?|"Hello,

I have lurked on the place for a bit and just got courage to create a username to past my situation.

This may be long winded. And I apologize about that.

So my wife (28f) and me (28m) have been married since May. Before that we have dated for 6 years.  We are now different people from when we first started dating and don't really get along like we used to. There have been many fights and distrust that has happened over the years both on my part and hers. Therapy on my side and her side too and yet we never make headway. 

Now the dirty details. 

After a few years of dating I wasn't feeling like I was getting what I wanted out of the relationship so I tried to communicate that it and turned into a fight. I was blaming her and she was blaming me. I was saying it was a one way relationship and I needed to hear that she loves me and that she can initiate intimate time too.  It would work for a couple weeks than go back to the normal way. This lead me to emotionally cheating. I went online pretending like I was interested in meeting up just to hear that someone thought I was cute or looked good etc. I know what I did was stupid and wrong and hurtful to her. We talked it out and I went to therapy to work it out. She was asked to come to therapy with me and did a few session but the therapist after hearing everything and 10 or so sessions told my wife (then gf at the time) that she was the problem and give me what I wanted. Still undecided if that was good advice or not from a therapist but it caused another fight.

Side note. I feel like when cheating happens it's on both parties. If I was getting what we talked about then I wouldn't have gone looking for that emotional support. 

Move up some months nothing has changed and I stopped going online for those months but I still felt like things were missing in the relationship. More fights ensue and I get to the point where I tell her if fighting still happens then I will get bitter and not want to be with her anymore.  Things settle down with out much fixing the relationship. I still feel like it's a one sided relationship. Eventually I learn what erotic massage parlors are.  I was curious and told her i wanted to see what it's all about. We get in a massive fight she tells me she doesn't care and go. So I did. 

After that she broke up with me for 2 weeks and got back together dependant on me going to a  different therapist.  I did. Things got better for a while then we got engaged then out of nowhere more fighting on and off over small stupid irrelevant things. We ended up getting married about a year after.


The night before the wedding there was a  massive fight about her ditching the hotel room we paid for, for her  to sleep with her family. And on the honeymoon there was another huge fight.  Anytime we go on vacation from that point there's has not been a point where it's been a good vacation. Always stress and yelling at each other. Then never fixing the problem. I am to blame for that just as much as her.

So now here we are. Still fighting on a weekly basis. More like roommates than lovers. We have 2 animals and not much money in our bank account.  I still love with her but because of the fighting all the time I feel like I may not be in love with her anymore and I feel it's likely true with her even though she will never admit it. How can we get better? Anytime we sit down it's a fight. I don't want to leave because I still love her. And I don't give up on things until I exhaust every way to save it. We have only been married for 8 months now and I feel like I may be giving up too early.

Is this a lost cause? Can we fix it? Should I even try to keep on fixing it? 

Tl;dr been together 6 years. Constantly fight, want to fix it but falling out of love while still loving her from the fighting. Been married for 8 months."|loveitorloseit157|False|https://redd.it/ekzv8i|1|1.0|0|5|1|relationship_advice
ekwn88|2020-01-06 16:48:33|Asked my ex to help me move flats. He said yes. Is this a bad idea?|"I broke up with him a year ago because he couldn't commit to any future plans after a two year relationship (we are both late twenties), but we still respected each other and treated each other well, it didn't get ugly, just a lot of tears (mostly on my side) and he tried to come back but I realized that it's not because he decided to commit, but he just wanted our relationship back in the state that it was, not more. So we went no contact for almost 6 months.

I don't live in my home country and I don't have a friend with a car who can help me move, I don't have much stuff (my new flat is furnished) but I need to take my stuff to the new flat and it will be impossible without a car. So I decided to ask him (because before we broke up he said I could still ask him for help for things like this) if he could help me. He answered immediately and said it is not a problem and he'll do it. 

I am happy not to worry about moving logistics anymore, but I worry that this will awake some emotions in me or him, what if we get emotional or if it gets ugly? I dated some guys after him, hopefully we don't talk about dating life because I don't wanna know about his.

&#x200B;

How does one rebuild trust after lying about not talking to someone for years?  How do you get back what you lost?  How do you get her to trust in you again after you've lied twice about  the same person?  

Context below but it's a long read and gets vague as I'm not a professional writer...just needed an outlet....

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

## 

On Saturday, I had it all. All the things that one can only thank God for being blessed with…an amazing wife, two equally amazing children, friends, health, a good job, a credit score in the mid 700s….I was loved. In one moment, it all changed. With one text, it all came crumbling down. Imagine those sci-fi, end of the world, and nothing but rubble city scenes like in the Terminator movies. The text came from my little secret. My ‘harmless’ little lie. The culmination of years of lies of omission coming home. The text read, :

*Hi, this is XXXX, your husband and I have been texting for 20 years…..inappropriate photos…explicit texts….texted me when you were having problems….to mend my own relationship with my husband, I thought you should know…I should have stopped it but I liked the attention…I accept responsibility for my actions but your husband is a coward….*

You get the idea. For the context/history hungry readers, she was my BF from college. We crossed the line once for an awkward 3 min of intimacy but never went further. She moved south and I stayed. 103 miles apart. We kept in touch infrequently as much as time and tech would allow. We stopped communicating during the time I was dating my wife. My wife, or gf at the time, had her reservations about her. In my absolute ignorance, I couldn’t fathom why. We were just friends at that point. I think she even had kids by then. But the signs were there. Her significant other told her we should stop communicating. We complied. My gf even was understanding about it and offered her support at her bf losing a friend. But when we reestablished contact some time later, my gf formally addressed me of her concerns about the relationship. Again I maintained we were just friends. See the pattern. I didn’t. For someone people considered smart, I’m quite literally ignorant and oblivious to my own bad habits. I am by nature a selfish man, be it a product of being an only child, or my very soul. I recall she contacted me out of the blue ( which was the norm ) and I did relay this to my gf. Honesty, right? Transparency. It became one of the bigger fights we have had as a couple, but set the rules my deceitful mind went by: don’t tell gf if xxx contacts you. Fast forward to married life, and almost a decade later, two kids later (6 and 4 approx.), it starts up again. Infrequent texts, harmless pleasantries ( i.e. how are the kids, etc)..one line responses and done for another few months, infrequent lies, but lies of omission that were accruing like credit card debt.

But the signs were there. Signs that signaled stop and reconsider. Signs that read you are asking for the worst possible outcome imaginable. Signs that read this is not going to end up as you think it is.

I just failed to see them. Failed because I didn’t want to get into another pointless fight…because I didn’t want to see the harm…..reread that line…*I didn’t want to see the harm.* I didn’t want to because I didn’t feel I needed to. What was the harm is my justification. Honestly you can come up with any reasoning to justify your actions no matter how credible on the surface but flimsy beneath. Has that been a pattern for me all my life? I’ll justify my selfish actions via self centered reasoning but plausible to my logical mind. We’ll get back to that. But inevitably, the ‘harmless’ texts became flirtatious as was our mutual personalities. Cue inappropriate request for photo. Cue inappropriate explicit comment. Cue eventual discovery by her significant other. Cue the beginning of the end of my life as I know it. Cue the text message above.

But the signs were always there.

What signs? The one where she told me not to contact her should have been all I needed….seeing a similar experience occur from someone I knew…when she told me that once trust is gone, that’s it during a casual conversation….when she said I hate lies….when she did catch me lying about something financial and almost left me then…the ones when she told me to be honest with her always and I just scoffed at it and convinced myself I was….the signs were always there.

And now here I am. Wifeless. Soon to be childless. Looking down the barrel of divorce. Looking down a life I always read in articles like this and never wanted. Thinking self destructive thoughts. Crying in a ball on the floor. Tearing up every time I see my children. Crying hysterically on the phone with my wife who will be moving her things and the children’s things in 2 days. This is where my harmless lies have led me. This is a destination lies always lead to. We convince ourselves otherwise but in the end, lies will always come to the surface. You think yourself the exception. You got away with it all this time…big ones…small ones…every size in between….I mailed this…you didn’t….I called so and so…you didn’t….I paid that…you didn’t….I stopped communicating with XXX...but you didn’t.

Reader, this path will always end badly for you if you continue down it. Here the rub, you sometimes don’t even realize you’re doing it or it becomes so habitual that you actually believe it yourself. It becomes more difficult to differentiate the real world with the one you’ve projected when this happens. What’s the line…*you can fool yourself or you can fool others, but you can’t do both.* I realize this as I was in the car across from my maybe ex-wife as she told me she would never trust me again…that she wanted a divorce…that she can’t believe how I lied and betrayed her…how even though I never physically cheated, it was the same thing…..that the one thing she asked me to do above others was ridiculously ignored and maintained despite her feelings again and again….that I was selfish and deceitful…that I destroyed our family….her trust…made a fool of her….that I was not the man she thought I was…that I was a coward…a liar….a child……

Guilty as charged.

Now as I look into her eyes, that are full of tears, rage, disgust…I now realize how amazing I had it…how amazing I used to have it. We’ve always read the articles, watched the movies, heard it from our friends and family that family above all else…you never know how good it is until it’s gone…you cheerfully or solemnly acknowledge it and go on with your life….but really none of us can truly appreciate anything until it’s literally ripped from our grasp and we are left with nothing. Naked. Alone. It’s a human failing. We allow the distractions of everyday life to cover this appreciation. We have only so much energy during the day and you allow routine to set in. Planned vacations…errands…the daily grind of the children’s schedule…all these things day after day tend to cloud our perceptions. Need a reminder…try to remember when you first started dating…is that how you feel when she calls you now? The same rush…the same smile from ear to ear…or is it like answering a work call or a flatline response? It’s ok if your answer isn’t one you are comfortable with. Your honest answer…not the one your mind is trying to justify and recall memories to back up that play…or was it just me? I doubt it. I have a good memory and it reminds me when I remove my rose colored glasses that I answered the call with a sigh because it was disrupting a song, or Youtube tutorial I was listening to in the car. Usually when she called I was driving home after a long day at work..I was tired, etc….but I’m sure you have your own excuses or defense mechanisms in place. I did. I should have realized everyday on some level what I have exactly. A woman who loved me enough to call and ask how I’m doing…to see if I’m ok. She did this usually twice a day when she was driving them to school and picking them up. She would call when my family was all together so we could all talk together. Tragically ironic this is when I finally realize that….is this what it really takes before we wise up…sadly it does. We all have this human tendency to tone this amazing scene down of its color, its clarity, its vibrancy in the backdrop of daily life. The truly blessed ones of us have the ability of overcome this. They are truly the lucky ones. They are the ones who should be envied and aspired after. The ones who truly see what is important and can cherish and appreciate it day after day and never lose sight of that. With them the vibrancy grows daily and actually drowns out the rest of the mundane backdrop of the daily. I was not one of these fortunate few. I took her and my children for granted. I allowed their light to fade in the background of less important priorities. We all do it right? Does it make it right? We’re only human right? Somehow it doesn’t make anything feel better. Reading this makes it seem so ridiculous.

Now for the list/bulletpoint readers:The gist (especially for the morally flexible):\* Don’t lie to your loved ones…ever….for any reason (stop with the “well what if…)…just don’t\* Cherish and appreciate your family and all your blessings….if you need to post it, auto remind or tattoo..

Dear Reader, it is my hope that I did not ramble on like a confused and delirious desperate individual. As I proofread and reread, I felt the need to leave the rawness of this blog. It is essential you see what both lies and complacency lead to. While I initially sought to portray this ignorance from a male POV, I digress that it affects all of us as humans. We all suffer from this weakness. Some more than others. We all lie at some point but not this type..not to this degree….not to this length of time….not to the one made vows to…not to the one who trusts you with their heart…with your children…with their future together…not to her/him….it will NEVER turn out ok…. At the same priority, take moments to appreciate your family, your wife, children if you have them, your life. Even if its a simple as looking at the rear view mirror and seeing those smiling faces and looking to your side and seeing them there…as simple as driving her to work without complaint…as spending a few moments in the morning with her before she goes off or I go off….seeing her sleeping peacefully next to you or when you go to work….holding her hand in the car….the smell of her hair….seeing her smile at you…seeing your children grow together under one roof…going to dinners…stores…the simple things….my God, I have truly lost that. In my selfishness and arrogance I traded my family away for some ill written texts and lies. I continually overrode my morality and code regarding this for something I considered harmless. That harmless has turned into Stage 5 terminal now. I stand alone with a schedule to see my beloved children next week and her contemplating permanent separation. I cry. She cries. Our eldest daughter cries. All of it thanks to me. All of it because of me. I could blame XXXX but it was me. I could have put a stop to it a long time ago and not be writing this…but my selfishness had to come first. This is me getting back to that. This was me betraying my gf, then wife, then mother of my children…for what? For nothing….which is what I have left. Nothing. So I give this knowledge to you as I watch my wife move her clothes out our bedroom into the van. I give you the outcome of my actions so you can at least think twice before you start or continue something….so you can come clean before it’s too late….so you can still wake up to them in bed…so you can see your kids running downstairs at 7 in the morning….so you can see them grow up into healthy people…so you can hold her hand in the mall and see her smile….It may be too late for me, but please, if you love her/him…if you love your family….your life as it is with all the ups and downs….please learn from me….tell your family and friends….I have no pride or ego about anything anymore….learn from me….grow from this.

ekzum1|2020-01-06 20:33:44|Not sure where to go from here..|"I met this guy on hinge, a dating app, and we instantly hit it off. We started texting all day every day sending each other memes and videos we like, talking about movies and music, covering all the basic topics getting to know each other. I was completely being myself and being super genuine so I felt comfortable with him. We were talking for a couple weeks until one night at the same time by chance we asked what the other was doing and if we could hangout. We decided to meet, so I went to a bar with two of my girl friends (I needed a drink before picking him up, I started getting nervous) then went to get him. 

Previously I had only seen photos of him on his instagram which he had stopped updating for about three years, so all the photos were out of date. He didn’t seem all too attractive in them which made me feel more at ease meeting him, not like he was some super hot intimidating guy, and because we genuinely got along personality wise. I was shocked when he got in my car though, because he was so much more attractive than his pictures. Tall guy with a nice full even beard and great smile, very attractive voice. I kind of immediately started to melt for him. We had a great night talking, conversation came super easily and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. 

When the time came for my girl to leave (she had a curfew she needed to be home for) we all got together and drove her home, him coming with us. My other friend got picked up by an uber. Once we got her home we decided to go back to the same bar to continue our night.. we talked together just the two of us for many more hours until he payed our bill and I dropped him off at home. We kissed goodbye and he said things had gone far better than he had expected.

From then on we texted constantly, good-morning, goodnight, so on so forth. We hung-out again another time at his house and things got physical, but he said we could wait until a later time which made me feel more comfortable, like he was genuinely interested in me and not using my body. At this point I was super head over heels for him.  We had been talking for about a month now, and I wanted things to get serious but neither of us breached that topic yet.

The whole time, from the very beginning I felt as though things would end,  it was just a matter of time. I feel like I made that come to pass in a self sabotage manner because of my insecurities thinking he was too good for me despite the signs I had received of his interest in me. We were going to see each other again, so I drove to his house and we watched netflix, talked about our days and such. I was high, so I felt anxious and closed off with a cloudy mind and couldn’t direct the conversation as easily as usual. It was a bad decision to smoke before going, I don’t know why I did. I feel like that made things more awkward and I couldn’t read the vibe very well anymore. Things got physical again and didn’t go so smooth, in fact extremely awkward. I ended up accidentally forgetting my shirt at his place. Although things were off, when I left he still kissed me at the door with a big smile.

After the awkwardness of that night, our texting changed, we missed a couple days saying morning and night and instead of immediate answers and easy conversation texts were spread out over hours. I could feel the vibe change. I really wanted to see him again because I knew if I met him in person and sober I could fix the connection, make things more at ease and how it was initially. 

Flash forward to the weekend, I finish work late, and get home around 11:45 pm, and he texts me saying he’s going out with his guys. I tell him to enjoy his night and i’d live vicariously through him, but he invites me out. It was late and I texted my friends but no one was available to go with me, so I told him if I came I would be coming alone. He said that was fine that I didn’t HAVE to bring anyone. I had a bad feeling about doing it but because I wanted to see him so bad and fix this unsaid awkwardness between us I decided to go. I ubered downtown to meet him and low and behold he’s not where he said he would be. I called and texted him but he didn’t answer. I had made a friend at the bar so I wasn’t alone, I just explained my situation and she took me under her wing. Never before had something like that happened to me and I felt ashamed of myself, for not having a friend to go out with me and for making the decision to go alone in the first place. My other girl was on her way home from a guys house downtown just by chance, and offered me a ride, which I accepted because he wasn’t anywhere around nor answering me and I didn’t want to pay for another expensive Uber home alone.  When we got about halfway home he called my phone (about an hour later) and I told him I was almost home.. he didn’t say sorry or anything or even acknowledge he had done me wrong in some way which hurt my feelings.

The next day I waited for some sort of explanation or apology text but it never came. The day after that I decided to text him to tell him I had no bad blood and would like to drop by to grab my shirt. He ignored me. Soooo I wrote this huge paragraph telling him he was ridiculously childish for not being able to bend his pride and apologize among other things which would have insulted him (targeting the awkward physical encounter we had) and told him to go fuck himself (in retrospect I did this because I was disappointed by my high hopes for him and what we could be, which translated into anger and sadness at my prediction things would end coming to pass). 

His reply was to explain that he thought it would only be a couple days of silence which would  then break and things would carry on. I assumed he was dropping me though, because of how embarrassing that situation was for me, being stood up by the guy I started to really care about, with no explanation or apology. I picked up my shirt and we said bye, but as I was leaving he called out to text him if I wanted to. 

I waited a week to do that because I was simmering in my hurt  and disappointment.  I asked him if he wanted to hangout and he replied with “don’t you hate me?” to which I then explained I definitely did not, he had just pissed me off so I spoke my mind. He told me he couldn’t see me because he was leaving the next morning very early to visit his family at home for Christmas and needed to get his car repaired for the drive. I told him to text me when he got back, but that has yet to happen.  I don’t know if he will because I said a lot of harsh things in my fuck you message to him, but I really want him to text me. I also went back on hinge and updated my profile so he could see I was “using” it again but I actually haven’t talked to anyone, i’ve just been thinking about him. 

I went back on Hinge recently to check his profile but its been removed from my conversations, which means he must have seen my hinge profile too and removed me. I regret how I exploded over the whole situation and I feel like I made a self fulfilling prophecy of it falling through because of how I acted. I miss him and I want him but I don’t know how to go about things from here.  

I’m debating texting him to explain it all, be open and vulnerable and just spill my heart, but it’s also going to be really shitty if he ignores me. Worth a shot though, even if I’m left sad, I think he’s worth it. What do I do??"|Manda_3ear|False|https://redd.it/ekzum1|1|1.0|0|5|1|relationship_advice

He was always there for her when she had her operation. Recently she told me that she was going to invite him round her house on Saturday night to give him his late birthday present and have a few drinks. I wasn't happy but she assures me she only wants me. I can't stop thinking something might happen if he tries it on. We have spoken loads about it and I'm not going to stop her but have expressed my concern and although she knows I'm hurting she is going ahead with it. I can't be there so wouldn't know if anything would happen.  Should I be worried? And should I let her get on with it?|andytman999|False|https://redd.it/ekztij|1|1.0|0|24|1|relationship_advice
ekzrgm|2020-01-06 20:27:38|I (19M) want to help my boyfriend (19M) out of his financial situation, but I'm not sure where to go from here.|"I feel like I really need help in this situation. 

I've been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend for over a year now. After his house was lost in an accident, he and his family moved from Indiana to Nevada in about the middle of 2019. He has been absolutely miserable since, and he and his family practically live on pennies. Around the same time this happened to him, I decided I was going to take a gap year and work while transferring to another university. I finished my last semester at my old school in May 2019, and he came and visited me and my family here in Connecticut only a few weeks later. Everyone loved him and I could tell he had a really great time.

As one might imagine, I've tried to do all in my power to help him. Seeing as I worked I would send a portion of my paychecks to him whenever he needed it for food or emergencies, but this was sporadic and something not very consistent. I'm still not even 20, so my options were limited. Trying to think more practically, I asked him if he would want to consider renting out a room with me and my parents and work in Connecticut to send money back home; as I mentioned, my family really enjoyed his presence, and the pay in Connecticut would be better than most starting jobs in Nevada. While I understand that it's a lot to ask of him and my family, I feel like it's a decent way to get him out of a living situation where he is incredibly unhappy and to help out his parents in his own way.

I've suggested this to him more than once, and every time he says it could never happen. Not that he doesn't want to do it, but I just feel like he shuts down the suggestion entirely. He's afraid to be away from his mom, he's afraid to take advantage of his boyfriend and their family. And, again, I know it's a lot to ask of him, but I feel like it's the best way to make some actual progress in his life and to help his family. I just want to help him out, but I'm only one human, and I have no money left to help him out. Am I trying to do too much? Am I doing too little? I'm just lost. I want to help him, but it sometimes feels like he won't go the extra mile to go out of his comfort zone to help himself and his family. I never make posts like these, but I think I need a push in the right direction from someone unbiased.

Thank you. Anything is appreciated, truthfully."|HeirToTurnabout|False|https://redd.it/ekzrgm|1|1.0|0|5|1|relationship_advice

Just some red flags. For instance she does text me everyday but only in the evening. I know that’s not that big a deal people are busy. It’s just during the day it will take her hours to respond but at night she responds almost immediately. 
Another red flag is that we will set up a date and she’ll cancel at the last minute especially on Fridays. And she will drop off the face of the earth.  Again not a huge deal life is life and shit happens. 
Another red flag for me is that I have straight up asked her and instead of getting a yes or no answer she told me she didn’t think she could be with someone so insecure. And she’s always doing things like that whenever I try to have a serious conversation with her she’s either playing the victim, deflecting, or getting into an argument over it. 
And my biggest red flag is that I’ve never been to her house. I do know where she live but every time I’ve asked to go over she’ll tell me a different story of why it’s not a good time to go over. It’s either she’s sick and doesn’t want to get me sick, or her house is a mess, or she has her family over which I’ve only ever met when they stopped by work and she never introduced me too she just told me that was her so and so. 
We got gifts for each other this Christmas and she told me one of mine was in the mail and hasn’t gotten here yet. Then she calls me and tells me it’s here so I ask if I could go pick it up. And I even mentioned that I wouldn’t come inside and that I’d text her when i got close and she could run it out to me. And I heard panic in her voice she was like what I’m super busy right now I have to go to my sisters anyways so I’ll drop it off to you. And I found this odd because I talked to her earlier and asked what her plans were and she said she wasn’t going to do anything but lounge around all day.

ekszcx|2020-01-06 11:35:52|I(25F) am pregnant and my husband (34M) is getting cold feet about having a baby.|"We both have said that we want a child but I fear his anxiety about me actually getting pregnant is saying otherwise. He doesn't feel prepared for a baby and both of us have been caught off guard at the suddenness of it. To be fair, he has made some fair points as to why we should abort this pregnancy:

1. He says he is not where he wants to be financially yet.
2. I just started a new promising job in my field after a year of searching. Where we live, the market for my career is saturated. The company I work for is a new, very small office and I would have to take maternity leave about 8 months into working.
3. We have only been married since last fall. We dated for less than a year prior to marriage. We had a courthouse wedding and a big honeymoon. Relatively, this is a very quick timeline in terms of dating and marriage.
4. He feels very self conscious about his family judging him for having a baby in such a short timeline. His family feels like we shouldn't of gotten married so soon. My family is completely opposite and supportive of our relationship.

I don't think we are in as big of a dilemma and I think he may be getting anxiety about such a big life change. We have foundations for raising a healthy child:

1. We own our home and have more than enough space for a baby. It's a starter home, but the school district is well rated and we don't have plans on moving in the next 10 years.
2. He has a very secure job with upward mobility and amazing health insurance. His work would not be compromised as I fully expect that my sister and I will be doing majority of the heavy lifting when it comes to the baby.
3. My sister has already agreed to be a live in nanny for me so I can go back to work asap. She would prefer this arrangement because she would have a free bedroom, free food, and (modest) financial compensation.
4. My extended family lives within 3 hours driving distance and my grandmother has been begging for a grandchild. If we ever needed to go out of town, I am confident that we would have babysitting options.
5. We are already married and committed to one another, short timeline or not.

Reasons why I am considering going through with an abortion:

1. We have been saving for a small vow renewal ceremony at our church for this year. When we had our courthouse wedding, we had both agreed that we wanted to go explore Europe together and spent wedding money on that. But now we both want better pictures with our families there this time. A baby would delay the vow renewal ceremony (or it may never officially happen).
2. It has been a terrible process for me looking for a job after college graduation. This job is very promising and I fear that I may be let go due to the fact that I am pregnant. I know this is illegal, but I've been discriminated against before and companies get away with illegal things all the time. I am very excited to have this work opportunity.
3. His mother does not like me and has made it known. I don't feel like I would get support from her and she lives closer to us than my family. I fear his mother would make my life hellish.
4. I don't want him to feel resentment towards me if he feels pushed into fatherhood.

He has suggested that we have a quiet abortion and try again in a year or two when we are more financially established and have been married for longer. We have been seeing a marriage counselor for several months ( for preventive reasons, not because we are divorcing) and we will certainly be talking about this.

tl;dr: I am pregnant at a less than perfect time, husband is leaning towards abortion but I am torn. What is your advice reddit?

ekwaok|2020-01-06 16:23:03|I'm (19M) struggling on how to end my relationship with gf (19F)|"Hi everyone,

This is the first relationship I've been in, well ""seriously"" anyway so I (M19) don't know how to go about ending my relationship with my gf (F19). To cut a long story short, none of my friends or family are supportive of my relationship with her because they believe she takes advantage of me, she doesn't pull her weight and we're just not suited long term, which some aspects I agree too. (Put at bottom specifics as not really relevant to the question)

I don't know whether their influence has made me see these aspects, but as soon as my family and friends were honest about what they thought, I started to agree and could see where they were coming from if that makes sense.

My gf isn't very emotionally stable, her relationships with her family aren't very good, she hardly interacts with family in her house, doesn't get any support from them at all, they exclude her from family outings ect, which is why I'm very cautious about ending our relationship because I feel that if we do break up, she'd have literally no one. Sometimes I feel like she is emotionally blackmailing me by saying things like ""you're the only person I trust and can talk to"" ""I don't know how I'd cope without you"" ""You're the most important person to me"", you get the gist.

I've said to myself that if I have doubts or second thoughts about any relationship I'm in, it isn't working and to be true to myself and end it, but I just feel like I can't with her because of her mental state. It's got to the point that I'm getting ill myself with the stress of dealing with my own problems, as well as hers, as well as worrying when / how to break up with her, I'm not eating / working out like I used to. I don't know if that's selfish but I do not want to make myself ill when I don't see things getting any better between us.

Please could you give your advice / experience on how I go about this please. If you have any stories on how you broke up with a emotional partner and how you (if at all) support them after breaking up.

Appreciate any comments.

&#x200B;

Specifics: For example, I'm always arranging meeting up, I'm always driving us everywhere, I'm always round her house, I'm paying for 80% of the time we go out, she isn't interdependent, I'm always cooking food and washing up, tidying up ect. I just wanted to put in 100% effort into our relationship as it's my first one but I feel like she's taken advantage and now just expects me to do mainly everything. I feel like she's very attention seeking, I assume from lack of attention when I'm not there, for example if we were watching TV and she's on her phone, if I pick my phone up for a few minutes she's slapping it out my hand because I'm not giving her attention, even though she's on her phone, all of which are red flags and I'm not really happy with. 

Basically I have decided I want to concentrate on myself more, even though it may sound selfish, I'm 19, I don't want to tie myself down and live unhappy."|FamiliarPineapple6|False|https://redd.it/ekwaok|2|0.75|0|6|1|relationship_advice

I have two children from a previous marriage. I have joint custody(1 day during the week, every other weekend, Christmas breaks, summer break, etc.) My ex wanted to continue to stay in their lives when we broke up, but I wouldn’t allow it. I couldn’t handle her being in their lives if we weren’t going to be together. 

During our time apart. I’ve gotten a good job. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD(due to a past accident) and depression. I’m getting help for my issues with drinking. My ex always tried to help with these issues. She did a lot for my family and for me. She has a place of her own now and went back to school and is almost finished.

We didn’t speak for months. I recently reached out to her to tell her my diagnosis and all the changes I’ve been making. I wanted to thank her for all she did. She blames herself for everything and I wanted to apologize for the things I’ve put her through, because it’s been a lot. But most of all I want to start over. I want to marry her. I want to be a family again.

She says that part of the reason she left was that she didn’t want the kids to see an unhealthy relationship. She misses them very much but said she doesn’t know how we could ever explain her being gone for a year.

She’s the best thing for me and my kids. I want to completely start over. But she says she doesn’t know if it would be healthy. I want her to know it will be.

ekzezf|2020-01-06 20:03:49|throwRA How do I (f,33) know if to breakup with bf (m,31)?|"My post got deleted before so I am trying it again:  


So, it's really hard to write this. I already feel sad and guilty just thinking about writing what I am about to write.

I am in a relationship with a super kind man. It's been nearly 8 years now. We met online. After a year of long distance relationship he moved to my country and in my apartment - just for me. We had so many plans!He's a super introvert. I am a super extrovert. When I first met him in real life, I knew he wasn't someone I would have given a chance if we met ""normally"". But as we met online and talked for about 3 months before meeting, I knew him and I gave him a chance and fell in love with him. Even though it took a while. For him ist was totally different. He says he saw me and was blown away.

He stayed with me for four weeks before returning to his country. Back then I was 25, 4 years single and had 1 ex boyfriend. I was never the kind of person who was desperate to find someone. I enjoyed my single years. I dated, I had heartaches and I was the cause of heartaches. As soon as someone wanted a relationship, I blocked off. I was afraid. I guess also because my 1 ex was horrible and always made me feel uncomfortable about myself.

Anyway, the fact that I met my bf online is the reason he got a chance. One could say he sneaked into my life. We understood each other. We both had horrible childhoods. That connected us. We shared the same humour.

I also need to mention that I was always a bit of a ""Monk"" (tv series). I was too tidy. My mum always said she was afraid to touch anything in my apartment because she could make something dirty. I know it was too much. But I just feel comfortable in a clean and tidy surrounding. Even though I am not a minimalist.

So, my bf moved in with me. He's the total opposite. In the past 7 years we're living together now, I guess 80 % of the time we lived in a horrible dirty house. Things everywhere on the floor. The kitchen disgusting with loads of food rotting in the sink. I guess I just gave up at some point. He has a lot of food issues, so he cooks. He's a great cook, but a super dirty one. Food on the floor. Everything full of oil. The sink full of leftovers. And then he doesn't clean it. I stopped cooking just because I couldn't stand being in the kitchen. I just resigned. Then I always had a full time job. I was super exhausted in the evenings. My bf didn't work but also didn't tidy.

After 1 year he found a half time job. I always drove him the and picked him up again. He didn't have a driver's license. So I worked but also drove him around. He comes from a very poor background so I was used to pay for everything. When he worked night shifts, I also drove him then. After two years, he couldn't work anymore because he injured his back.

I found a new job. We moved. That job turned out to be super stressful. I came home in the evenings, my bf (unemployed) had always dinner prepared for me. He is such a kind soul and loves me extremely. I think he loves me more than I love him. He's also very clingy and I am not. But I guess that's also because I am the only person he has. He doesn't have friends here. He doesn't want friends here. Anyway, the first months we lived in an empty apartment because he couldn't manage to paint the walls. Even though he was home all day long. We can't get spontaneous guests, because I don't want to let them in. I am ashamed. When I was alone it was normal for me to invite people. I know I am mixing my thoughts, but I guess you'll get the point. So, he finally found a job. A full time job. For the first time. I was so relieved because we finally didn't have money problems anymore. You can imagine because I was the only one with a full time job. So, I was happy. I thought the bad years are over. But then, after only a month in that job, he broke down. He fell into huuuuge depression, That was in November 2017 and since then he doesn't work. I am, again, the only supporter. In addition I do all the paper work, all the thinking. I also do everything for him, because he still doesn't confidently talks my language. After 7 years in this country. He understands everything. He can talk it slowly. But he can't have a conversation. He just shuts off.

Right now he's in rehab for his mental state. The apartment is clean. I feel comfortable. But I know it'll change. I was hoping he'll get better there but it's the opposite. He calls me every day telling me how horrible he feels. I does put me down. I feel sorry for him, but I also think something MUST change. I am 33. Of course I hear my biological clock ticking. I often feel more than a care taker instead of a girlfriend. When we kiss, I feel nothing. He wants sex, but I don't. Even though in the beginning we couldn't get enough. I was hoping he will get better, but I know nothing will have changed when he comes back. I don't see a future. And that makes my heart ache. I am so fond of him. I don't want to hurt him. If I was to breakup, he would lose everything. His home, his future, his hopes. I guess he'd have to move back to his country. I know he could move to his dad and step mother, but it's the town his real mother lives and I know she's a major reason for his depression. We don't have contact to her. She cut him off, She's a devil. How could I do this to him? I am crying whilst writing this. I think of all the nice memories we have together. So many. But it is so so hard for me. His sickness and my stressful job lead to a burnout of myself. I am on sick leave since September last year. I hated my new boss, I hat loads of stress at work. And then I come home into a dirt hole, to someone who needed all my strength. I just couldn't anymore. My body just stopped last year. I couldn't take all the responsibility anymore. But then I think I can't leave someone for being sick. What an a\*\*hole would I be?! It's not his fault. But I feel that I can't anymore. It also makes it worse that every single person in my surrounding (family and friends) is telling me since years to break up. That he's no good for me. That I don't need to take the responsibility for his life. I am thinking of ending it since years every now and then. But then I get my hopes up again. He still makes me laugh. He is such a good person. I know it would crush him if I would leave him. I know that he feels totally different about our relationship. But I also know that his view is totally different. His family likes me. I provide for us. I do everything for him. I drive him around. He has a driver's license sine 2017 but still doesn't drive. It is too much for me. There were occasions when I wasn't fit for driving. When I was exhausted. And not even then he tried it. Everything is on me. But then I think he cooks for me. He cares for me that I stay healthy. I don't know what to do. How could I do this to him? How would he get his belongings to his country?! What if he doesn't find someone again (due to being madly in love with me, being heartbroken in that case and being an introvert). He wants children. What if I steal that from him? He doesn't deserve it. He had such a hard life. He doesn't have contact to his mother and sibling, because they cut him off. The mother is a psychopath! His twin sister is influenced by that horrible person.

For me it would be different. I have family and friends. I have support. He doesn't. My sick leave money stops in two weeks. I am applying for work even though I don't feel ready. I feel done. But it has to be done. We need money. I told him he needs to find a job. Today he called me that he won't do a labour job anymore, he can't. He doesn't have education for a proper job. He studied but didnt finish it. In my country you need to have studied or had to have an apprenticeship to be qualified for a good job. He has no choice but to do hard work, But I also understand why he doesn't want that. But now again. It is up to me. I don't feel able to return yet. But I will anyway. It has to be done. So I do it. Again. Me.

I know there's much more I could write but my head is just done.

EDIT: In the beginning I mentioned that I enjoyed my single years. I forgot to mention why I wrote that. I had sexual partners, with some of them I had feelings but there were only one night stands. I guess about 9 men if that's important. My bf doesn't know of that. He knows of 3 and already thinks that to be lots. I know he thinks girls are sluts when they have one night stands. But I don't regret it. I don't think it makes me a bad person. Of course it wasn't necessary but it happened. If he would know that he would think less of me. Even with those 3 he said back then that I am not the person that he thought I was. But I think everything that happened in my life made me the person I am. I would never ever cheat on him. I think I am a good hearted soul. A good person. I am kind and polite. But I know how he thinks of women with lots of exes and or sexual partners. If it was for him he'd be my first one."||False|https://redd.it/ekzezf|1|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice

My uncle bought an investment property and is letting us live in the house for good rent. If we go to school full time we can live here for free which is what I’m doing.

Luckily my sister has the whole upstairs to herself because it honestly looks like a tornado hit it. This is how it looks all the time. She has a big dog who sheds and slobbers, he’s probably the only thing that she looks forward too. She has a terrible job that she hates, won’t leave it. Both of our parents died years ago(10+). Her husband left her about 5 years ago. I’m extremely concerned about her because she used to be the closest person in my life. Now we live together and it’s like all in one day I’m worried as hell about her but also resenting the crap out of her because I’m the only one who keeps up with anything. The house would be a serious infestation if I wasn’t in it. If I ever come up stairs to ask her something the first thing she says is don’t judge me and I have to react if I’m not repulsed because I don’t want to upset her and make her more depressed. But that’s also enabling her and acting like it’s not big deal when it is. I have dreams about her dying, fear all the time that she’s going to hurt herself. I have brought this up to her but she assured me she would never do that. But I just recently lost a distant friend to suicide.

The fact of the matter is I want to quit school and move out of this house as soon as possible because I cannot deal with it. But I also owe it to my uncle to stay as he let us live here to not only make an investment but also because he is kind and wanted to support us. Obviously leaving my sister seems like a terrible option as well. But living here only makes my mental health decline when I’ve worked significantly hard to get to the mental space I’ve been in. (And it’s not like it’s even terrible compared to hers even though we’ve had similar circumstances)

Basically I’m asking how do I help my sister without making her feel worse than she does? Does leaving the house in the next year an inappropriate way to handle this situation?

P.S it would be the worst thing in the world for her to know I posted this because at Christmas I accidentally shared this with my uncle (excluded the dirty part because it’s his property) and grandma and I had to tell my sister that I did and she was so embarrassed I was just so scared because she decided to stay home on Christmas Eve instead of see the family."|blu3andy3llow|False|https://redd.it/ekzasc|1|0.67|0|7|1|relationship_advice

Recently the oldest brother in this family and my little sister have been getting much more close, they spend more time alone, separated from the rest of us, they always sit next to each other, and they sometimes get unusually physical. I've seen this same cycle happen before with church/family friends entering into relationships, and it always ends the same: it ruins the friendship of the families and they never talk to each other again. Also, the age difference seems super unhealthy, my sister is still in high school, just turned 18, and has no dating nexperience, and our friend is 5 years older than her. I know my sister is an legally an adult now and I want her to make her own choices, but I also want her to have healthy relationships, and this seems like a terrible place to start your dating experience. I know both of our parents and the rest of our siblings will feel even more uncomfortable about situation than I do, but I don't know what to do about it.

ekz9q5|2020-01-06 19:54:03|How do I (21F) politely tell my friend (19F) to stop telling me details of her new relationship experiences?|"So it's been over 7 months since my friend (19F, let's call her Sara) has been ""on a hunt"" for a boyfriend. At first it started innocently enough, she was interested in this guy (20?M) who basically didn't seem to put much effort into getting together with her at all (he kept finding excuses why he can't meet, didn't reply to her texts etc.), which naturally led to her complaining about him to her closest friend - me. 

After 2 months of giving her advice and trying to make her see the situation as it truly is by explaining to her that he's clearly not interested and that she should move on because he's a waste of her time, she finally listened when another friend we randomly met in the train told her the exact same thing I have been telling her for the past weeks and ended up cutting all contact with him whatsoever.

By the time she cut him off, she has already been messaging this other guy on Tinder, let's call him Kevin (19M). Kevin has been really nice to her since the beginning and while she didn't find him particularly attractive, she said she was desperate for a boyfriend and they ended up giving the relationship a chance. On the first date already he's been trying to get into her pants and Sara, without having any sexual experience whatsoever, was more than excited about stuff like this finally happening to her. The following dates have gradually been becoming more and more sexual, which kind of rang my bells and I told her to be careful around guys who are eager to get into her pants because I don't want her to get hurt. 

I know about every. single. thing. they've been doing because every time they met, she'd either send me a 5 minute long voice message telling me in detail about everything they've been doing together or she'd just type it out in a long essay, making sure I don't miss out on her telling me how they had raw sex on the backseat of her car.

I've had enough, to be completely honest. Ever since August she hasn't been talking about anything else besides her boyfriend drama. I am honored to be the one she rants to and wants to share her experience with, but I really just do not need to know everything she's doing. She's legit been sending me pictures of her hickeys, told me how they made out in a changing room at a shop, ASKED ME WHAT CHANGING ROOMS ARE THE BEST TO MAKE OUT IN??????, told me about every single detail she's been doing and I just do not care anymore. We don't talk about anything else because ever since we graduated from school, our interests just kinda drifted apart because she's pursuing her hobbies, I'm pursuing my interests, we no longer spend hours daily together, the friendship feels like it's dying out at this point.

I don't wanna hurt her but at the same time I don't know how to tell her that I do not care about how many strokes it takes for her new boyfriend before he finishes. I just don't.

I think it's also worth mentioning I've been in a serious relationship for over 2 years myself, and Sara admitted that she considers us the perfect couple, so sometimes it feels like she's seeking validation by telling me all her experiences, like she wants my approval that she's doing everything right like me and my boyfriend are, but I might be just assuming things. For all I know she's just excited and wants to share her excitement with her closest friend. 

I'm sorry if this post doesn't make a lot of sense. I'll happily answer any and all questions. Thanks for reading."|ThrowRAuwuwuwu|False|https://redd.it/ekz9q5|1|0.67|0|2|1|relationship_advice

ekct56|2020-01-05 13:09:14|"Should I break my friend's confidentiality to satisfy my girlfriend's norm of ""trusting partners share everything?"|"  

My good friend has recently confided in me about the breakdown of his marriage. It’s not at all uncomplicated and there are sensitive aspects of his situation and the various moving pieces of his family relationship that give him good reason to ask me to keep the details to myself.

My girlfriend is naturally curious to know what is going on with my friend. She doesn’t have a close relationship to my friend or his wife. She is trying to get more details than just a surface level “it’s not going great” out of me, but I repeat that I have promised my friend confidentiality.

My girlfriend is now employing different tactics to get ‘the story’ out of me. She says that she has shared with me details of her girl friends’ lives with me in the past. I didn’t need to know any of it, and if I asked how things were going with her friends, it was out of concern for her friends, their kids etc. She has started some disclosures with a “this is secret, promise not to tell”, but never once did I make her feel compelled to tell me anything.

My girlfriend is trying to throw guesses around to get me to tell her or give her clues, but it quickly went from funny to borderline unpleasant, when I repeated that I didn’t want to break my friend’s confidence.

She then threatened to call his wife, which I said was insane. I explained that calling his wife would do damage and that psycho tactics are a relationship breaker for me. She tried to backtrack by saying she was only joking.

She then tried to persuade me by using the ‘my parents tell each other everything’ line (I live in her country surrounded by her family and values), as if I should comply to her family values as ‘norms’ rather than hold by my own. I have promised to tell her when I myself have permission from my friend, and when he is through the tough or sensitive parts of his situation, so it’s not some kind of forbidden, awful, forever secret. Nothing in his situation reflects badly on him or me. He is the same guy she and I have always known. He just wants some privacy.

She says that people in relationships should be able to share anything which each other. She suggests that me not disclosing my friend’s problems to her is tantamount to me not trusting her

I just want to be allowed to respect my friends wishes without being subjected to pressure to follow someone else’s value system or face unpleasantness.

We have been friends since about 5th grade. Now we’re both in high school. I’ve been bottling up my feelings because I genuinely did cherish the friendship I had with him.

I thought I would confess senior year. But it turns out he’s now dating this girl, who is also my friend.

ekz5h1|2020-01-06 19:46:20|Advice for sort of restarting with this girl?|"So, I(22M) went out with my coworker(20F), after nearly 2 months of flirting, and a few weeks of non-stop texting. Stopped after 1 date, but left it open in case one of us left since I was her supervisor, and she didn't want someone to find out and get me fired. Fast forward to mid-December, she goes on unofficial leave(immigration stuff). Manager would rehire her if she wanted to come back. I reached out to her today just to ask how her new year went and see how her immigration stuff is going. Anyway, she tells me that due to current US political issues, her case got delayed again, indefinitely. And, I figure that by the time everything is done(could be months), my manager will hire someone new to replace her. I want to ask her out again, but if feel like a douche to use her situation for my benefit. If i wait too long, i think she might grow disinterested.

I had originally decided that by next week, she would have decided to come back if she wanted to, assuming everything had gone according to plan(clearly it didn't).

We have only texted a few times since she left 3 weeks ago, but a few of them were full day conversations, including yesterday when she told me all of this. I’m pretty sure she still feels the same way about me, otherwise she wouldn’t spend all day texting(she had said on our date that she wouldn't have texted me all day if she wasn't interested in me). I just don’t want to seem like an asshole trying to capitalize on her situation.

Like I said above, should I wait a week or so when I was originally planning to ask her out again? Or should i just go for it now? I was pretty confident that she would've said yes(judging by our text interactions, it was sort of the same prior to our date) because I was about 99% sure she wasn't going to come back.

I was thinking possibly asking to just hangout sometime this week, because she seems pretty bored at home(babysitting her sister and watching netflix all day, can't work atm), but I think I might get ""friendzoned"" if I do that.

We'd been in an open relationship when we met and have talked about going back to that eventually, but he said even in that capacity he wouldn't be comfortable with me doing those things. And just to be clear, I want and would love if he participated in my kinks.

To be fair, we were already having a fight when I mentioned these things so his reaction may have been more dramatic than normal. But I basically said it was more important for him to be happy and that I would be willing to give up what I wanted because it was opposite what he wanted and I'd rather he be happy than resentful of me.

And I still feel that way to a degree, but I also feel pretty strongly that this exploration is something important I need to do. I grew up being emotionally abused and being told that who I was was unacceptable and hated myself for a long time. I've gotten to grow into my own person now, but it feels like this line he's drawing is a lot like the lines I had as a kid. When I told him about what I wanted, he was kind of disgusted and horrified, and that made me feel like the kinks I have are shameful, which is a feeling I've been trying to shed since I got away from my parents.

I really want to figure this out diplomatically because I love my boyfriend very much and I want to be with him forever, but I don't think I'm ready to put aside these things I need to explore forever. I don't want to never get the chance to figure myself out. I know I need to have a conversation with him, but I'm worried he's gonna react just as badly, and even if he doesn't, I don't know how to try and make a compromise that doesn't make him upset and lets me really be me.

tldr: I feel like I need to explore my kinks for the sake of my personhood, my boyfriend is really not into me exploring them, with him or anyone else."|ThrowRA5085965250|False|https://redd.it/ekz5g9|1|0.6|0|11|1|relationship_advice
ekz5e5|2020-01-06 19:46:11|I (28F) have trouble dealing with previous assault PTSD when dating partner (31M)|"So, this is more of a realization that just happened, an epiphany if you will, that sometimes when I'm hooking up with someone I'm dating, I will randomly get a sinking feeling and feel really disconnected/taken advantage of or used  for no real reason, right in the middle of whatever is happening. In the past when this dissociation happened, I would just keep going along even though I didn't feel ok at all. So this question is not just about this guy, but in general.

Background- I was in a relationship from 18-25 with a man who was abusive and would force me to do things I didn't want to, so it feels almost like autopilot, which I know my current partner doesn't intend to happen. I literally just met my current partner a few days ago lol at a convention and we spent entire days together and just got close really fast. I don't want to come off like a nutcase or like drama, but I don't know how to address this with him.

Lately to acknowledge myself when I feel that way, I just stop engaging but I don't explain why. When he asked me to continue, I just said I was sleepy instead of getting into heavy explanations. I'm also hesitant to bring this up because I don't know what I'm asking him to even do or what can be done in the moment when I'm feeling triggered or start dissociating. I just start mentally panicking and trying to get out of the situation and thinking ""I don't want to do this, why are you trying to make me do this"" which is totally illogical in the scenario. He respects my no's and has never pressured me. Any advice? I'm already in therapy and will discuss with her when we meet on Wednesday, but wanted to hear from others who may have dealt with something similar. He's a super understanding person so I know he will listen but like I said, I don't even know what I'm really asking him to do here. We have a weekend trip planned this weekend and I'm feeling nervous now. I want to see him, I'm excited about the trip, but I am also nervous.

ekilwh|2020-01-05 20:30:31|Thinking about calling off my(28f) wedding because of “family”|"So to make a very long story short here we go. 

I am supposed to be getting married in August this year. My fiancé and I have been planning our wedding. School and family health issues have gotten in the way of planning things so progress is slightly lagging. 

Anyway, I was with my mom helping take care of my father when my mom brings up wedding stuff to me. She then makes a statement about how my SIL is going to be a bridesmaid. I’ve been telling my mom for an entire year SIL will not be in the wedding period and neither will her husband, my brother. 

The reason why is because my brother is a dick, always has been and always will be. His now wife is also a dick. They go out of their way to be condescending, controlling, manipulative and toxic anytime they are around the rest of my family and I. I feel like it’s completely normal to not really enjoy people that behave this way. 

My mom is aware of everything that has happened . She is aware of their abuse towards me and my fiancé , the bad behavior, the name calling, all of it. She is aware my brother has threatened and tried to fight my fiancé who just stood and kept his cool and held his tongue while my brother was going on a drunken rampage. Every single time these two mess up and act psychotic, my fiancé and I are told to just be the bigger person and forgive them. It’s insane to me that for some reason everyone eventually forgets about my brother and SIL behaving poorly and then it’s like it never even happened and for some reason since my fiancé and I don’t forget, we are the bad ones for holding onto ill feelings towards them. 

My mom keeps telling me basically no matter what they do or say to me to hurt me and my fiancé, it doesn’t matter because family is family and it’s the most important thing. My mom also added that if I do not have them in the wedding it will be my fault that our family is being “ripped apart”. My mom and dad both agreed that since they are paying for the wedding, all of my siblings and their spouses will be in the wedding party , this choice is not up to me but up to my parents. My mom then tells me that I shouldn’t have my friends in my wedding party anyway because “they are not in it for the long haul”. It’s funny how she came to this conclusion even though my friends have never treated me as poorly as my brother and his wife. And she’s aware of this. 

My mom told me that no matter what I have to suck it up because I have to keep the family together. 

When I explain to them they absolutely do not have to pay for our wedding, we have the finances and I will literally write them a check for the money they have spent (around 10k) they shake their heads and get angry and say “no this is our job, we are your parents and we are supposed to pay for the wedding”. 

I am feeling so stuck, like I can’t win and I’m not even excited to get married. I don’t want to have a wedding, I don’t understand why my parents would do this and I don’t understand how I am the bad guy when I’ve been on the receiving end of abusive behavior and language by my brother and his wife. 

I need help which is why I’ve come here. I’m sorry for the formatting, I’m just really confused and mixed up. Any advice would help. Thank you."|SassyPikachuu|False|https://redd.it/ekilwh|72|0.91|0|70|1|relationship_advice

ekz31t|2020-01-06 19:41:58|My last serious relationship ended amicably, and we haven’t had any contact since. Would it be a mistake to reach back out to her?|"We’re both 19 and in college, just for reference.

I dated a girl for 4 months until she broke up with me in September. For a majority of it, things were perfect. It was everything I wanted out of a relationship, I felt like we were super compatible, we never even argued or disagreed about anything. It really felt like I found my other half.

When school started up and we moved back into the dorms, she started to grow a little more distant and cold. She was really, *REALLY* busy: taking 18 credits, a job, joining a sorority, and maintaining relationships with her friends. While I was upset we didn’t have time to really *go out* on dates or whatever, I didn’t mind as long as I got to spend time with her. Grabbing lunch, stopping by her dorm to watch Netflix during a study break, just little stuff like that. I understood that she had responsibilities and was busy, and I felt like even though it was only a little bit of time (like <2 hours) every couple days, she was still making time for me and wanted me around.

After as especially busy week, she told me she wanted to talk and my heart just immediately sank. She told me that being that busy was unfair to me (which I agreed with), and that she simply didn’t have time for a relationship. I argued with her at first until I realized that was a dumb thing to do, and that breaking up was the best course of action. She told me that I’m amazing and great and all that, and that I deserve better than what our relationship was. We agreed to cut contact to make things easier. I also told her I’d love to be with her again if she ever finds her life less chaotic, and she told me she didn’t want me to “wait for her.”

Honestly, I’m still not entirely over her. I had a short-but-intense rebound relationship with someone I wound up not being compatible with at all, but that’s been my only dating experience since then. I still think about her a lot. Not constantly or obsessively or anything like that, but more often than I should over someone who dumped me 4 months ago.

I’ve been thinking about texting her when school starts again, just asking if she wants to get lunch and catch up. Maybe her life is a little less crowded and we could make things work again. But honestly, I’m terrified of reaching out to her. She went from my best friend to a complete stranger overnight, and we haven’t talked at all since.

I feel like because things ended somewhat open-ended, I don’t really have closure on the relationship (despite the clean break), and reaching out to her would give me that closure. I’m scared of her not responding and being embarrassed, or her thinking I’m a creep who needs to get over himself. I’ve wondered, if she really wanted to get back together someday, would she reach out to me first? And was she actually too “busy” or did she just not want to make time for me and used that as an excuse?

I want to talk to her again, I’d like to be with her again, but I’m terrified of reaching out to her. It makes me feel pathetic and I’m not sure if I should just take the plunge to get closure (no matter what the result is), or accept what’s already happened and just try to move on without it.

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I split amicably because she was too busy for a relationship and that I deserve better. We haven’t talked since, but I still think about her. I’d like to reach out to her and see how she is, but I’m terrified of possible rejection. Ideally I’d like to just “move on,” but that hasn’t really happened yet."|WearsT-Shirts|False|https://redd.it/ekz31t|0|0.33|0|3|1|relationship_advice
ekz2q4|2020-01-06 19:41:17|I Need advices for going over my relationship|"Hi everybody, I didn't read the rules so I want to apologize now if I'll break any.
Basically I broke up with my girlfriend in July after 2 years and a half(we got together at 18y.o. each other), because I thought that she deserved a better person than me. 
I came at this conclusion because we were both toxic to each other in many different ways:
She was very jealous, we can't go out for a walk without arguing because, for her, I used to spend my time with her watching other girls. She used to get angry if I went out with friends without her. (I came to the conclusion that she was,and I think still be, a very insecure person)
I, on the other hand, acted in not such a fair way, going out without saying anything to her because I felt trap in this relationship.
Well, we wrote each other from July several times and we also seen each other for a night in October (and the time we spent together that day was deeply different,we really enjoyed it). She used to write me many times and one Day,in November, I decided to ask her to try another time to stay with me and she accepted giving me so many restrictions that I changed my mind and said to her that staying together should be a natural thing, without any rules (except for common sense rules).
2/3 weeks later I saw (I think that was around the 15 of December) her with another guy and this,by far, broke my heart.
I spent the worst Christmas ever and I felt so depressed that the 26 I wrote her asking if she wanted to try again and she said no. She treated me in such a bad way, insulting me and accusing me of all the problems we had (she never had this behaviour).
She doesn't follow me on Instagram but she constantly watch all my Instagram stories(it means that she has to look for my name everytime),she has picture with me (not kissing or something like that,but picture of me and her together) .
Another important thing that happened is that,on NYeve I post a poetry(of Eugenio Montale, ""ho sceso dandoti il braccio almeno un milione di scale""in my opinion,beautiful composition) on Instagram and she felt the urge to insult me saying that everything I said in the Instagram story was bullshit accusing me that I cheated on her (thing that I never did). On NY eve I was working,so I saw that she wrote me only at 2 AM and we spent the time from 2 am to 6 am writing each other. Well,it wasn't writing,it was more me saying that I couldn't believe (from the hints she constantly gave me) that everything was over for her,she saying that I ruined everything and(and that is important) where she was. It's important because from a certain point of the conversation I decided that I will have reached her wherever she were,and once said that to her she obviously said that I shouldn't did it. But at the same time she said me where she was, so I thought that she was indirectly saying to me that she wanted me to do that. 
Well, and 5 am the taxi answered to me (after something like 200 calls) and I went to the last position she said to me ( in the park under her house). Obviously she wasn't there. I waited for 30 minutes without any messages from her and then I decided to go home by foot (something like 1 hour walking). 
From that day the sadness has been replaced by the disappointment because I felt being played in such an evil way that I can't simply discribe it. I would never done something like that to her (or to any other person). I didn't write to her from that day because I think that she, disrespecteing me with what she have done, is not mature enough for a relationship. But I can't go over about her. I have so many questions unanswered but at the same time I want to hear nothing about her. And after all what happened  she's still watching my stories on Instagram. I'm here because I would like to have any advice from you guys for passing this situation in the best way possible without suffering another time like I've already done"|lumpierzaro1234|False|https://redd.it/ekz2q4|1|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice

Thank you|"I know my relationship is toxic. But I can't help but stay.. Everytime I try to breakup with him he won't let me or he guilt trips me into staying. I know he is not going to change for the better. He says sorry but there are no actions that shows he is sorry.

He has to get what he wants. If i say something he doesn't like he starts lashing out which in turn causes me to start raising my voice at him as well. Should I give him one more chance? But he keeps doing things that I do not like and even if I tell him he doesn't listen. He went through my phone before while i fell asleep in the car and starting attacking me for having a conversation with my friend who happened to be male. He then proceeded to block his number and make me delete his number and block him on all socials. But when I mention someone I do not like who I wouldnt even call his friend because they met once he would get defensive over her. And say im being weird etc.. 

He always brings up money and dangles it over my head. But I do not care about the money because I make money myself. When he buys me dinner I would assume its because he wants to. Later if we have an argument he HAS to bring it up. ""But I bought you dinner"" ""I just payed xamount for food"" and more. I tell him what he is doing is childish but he continues to do so. I feel like I already know what has to be done yet I can't get myself to fully commit. Obviously it's because I love him or because I have this attachment to him now. I want to make it work.

Shoot it’s hard for me when I think about it. But I’ve always tried being there for her, reassuring my feelings, trying to talk etc. Naturally before Oct we were very physical, and it was amazing. But since then we’ve had sex twice. We spoke about it about a month or so ago and she just said she was so sorry that she just wanted to get back feeling good. I just told her as much as I want to get physical like we used to I really wanted her to get back feeling like herself and thats where it ended. But now I’m getting a little frustrated. I have a history of anxiety.

It’s been another 2 months and I still didn’t feel like we were spending enough time together to really be considered a ‘couple’ and he told me it was because his family didn’t want me lying Everytime I come over (I’m not allowed to hang out with boys outside of school). I broke up with him even though he told me that he was trying to get us to spend time together, but after 4 months of hearing that over and over again I got tired.

It’s only been a day but I already regret it a lot, but at the same time I feel relieved because not seeing him (pretty much ever) made me question my self worth. I kinda want him back, but at the same time I know I can’t ask that for multiple reasons.

I think we’ve decided to remain good friends after our break up, but I’m not sure what to do now. If I talk to him about it I feel like it’ll be a burden on both of us on trying to figure out what we want, especially since I broke up with him both times."|ShrekspeareEssay|False|https://redd.it/ekz1ef|1|1.0|0|0|1|relationship_advice

ekyzz1|2020-01-06 19:35:57|My girlfriend of almost two years decided to take a break a few weeks ago and I don't know what to do.|"Basically what the title says. My (long distance) girlfriend of almost two years one day just texted me saying that she's ""just not feeling it anymore."" I can't say I didn't see it coming, because I could tell her attitude had completely changed for the last month or so of the relationship. We'd had some really good days, but for the most part around that time it was just completely dry.

We spoke about it for a while, and it essentially boiled down to her just wanting time to work on herself (had been having a lot of issues recently, I tried my best to be there for her but well, you can only do so much long distance.), but she said she still sees a future with me and still wants my company from time to time, and will always be there for me if I need her though she thinks it will probably be quite a while before we get back together. 

Now, I have tried my best to be supportive of it to her, but every day it still pretty much feels like a knife in the gut. I've not had anyone to help me through it because well, for years now she's the only person I've really had to help me with stuff like this. We have called twice since it happened, the first was just to talk for a few hours and it was great, and the second was last night and we watched a TV show together for a couple hours, you know, trying to be friends still and all.

 However, pretty much immediately after she hung up last night to go to bed I completely broke down crying because I couldn't help but think of how good we used to be together compared to how we are now. I'm fairly confident she knows that this has been hard on me, though I don't think she knows to what extent, because she has mentioned feeling like shit that she did this to me and all.

 This post is starting to get long, which I apologize for, but I just really need advice on what I can do to cope with it. I'm not going to cut her out, because she's the only friend I have and it does still seem like she cares, plus I'm still completely in love with her.

​Maybe someone who is a guy can help me? I am a woman and need different opinions/perspectives. 

I am leaving for the military this year or next year, I wanted to have fun and maybe start my hand at dating or casual sex. I've never had a boyfriend before and I just wanted to meet someone and see where it went. I've also never done anything sexual. Since I am joining the military, I figured I'd start with relationships now because later I won't have much time for that. I met a guy, and he was very easy to talk to and made me feel very comfortable. I had sex with him and I will forever be thankful that he wanted to considering I've never done anything. He insisted he'd drive me home and during the drive and even during sex, he would talk about our ""2nd, third, forth time having sex together"" etc. So he drove me home and I got really nervous and wanted to get out of the car and so I was getting out and he was saying he really wanted to see me again etc. I kind of freaked out and was happy he wanted to meet again and I said ""yeah sure"" and then left. When I got home I felt really stupid the way I left and I decided to text him on an app and try to get his number. He opened the messages and didn't give me his number until 3 or 4 hours later. I was very happy and texted him again saying I was very sorry and etc. He texted back immediately and said he gets it and that it's okay. 

The next day I text him asking what days he's free so that we could possibly meet up again, and we both have Google phones and so it will tell me if he has read and received messages. He read it and didn't text me back. I started to overthink a lot like maybe I wasn't any good, or that I'm not attractive enough to see again etc. I decided to not text him again and let it ride out. Still no response from him. 

Is this normal for relationships that aren't serious? I'm just confused because when we were together he REALLY was making a point that he wanted to meet again and now he's just not even texting back to my simple question. Does he not actually want to see me again? I don't really know. This is my first time experiencing anything involving relationships. I really like him and I hope he texts back regardless but should I even expect a text back?

eknmnw|2020-01-06 02:51:32|Combination of events of a single night has shaken my (22M) trust in my gf (22F)|"Hey everyone, help pls. 

It was new years eve, we were out. A guy sees my gf and says hi to her, she turns around to me and for some reason tells me something in the lines of ""I have a lot of friends, just so you know"", she greeted like a bunch of her friends in front of me and never said anything like this which there is no need to ofc i'm really not the jealous type, then this happens.

It's about 3 am we're all drunk as shit, i'm walking to the toilet and i see this guy standing pretty close to her, talking something and then her walking away to the toilet, i was meaning to ask her what that was about but the toilet was full so we headed outside (me holding her hand through the mass), get this now. We walk next to this guy and he decides it's a good idea to grab her by the hips and pull her in to tell her something. At this point i lose my shit, grab him by the chin and tell him ""get the fuck away from her, ok?"" he says ""ok"".

As she didn't yet explain what happened before i just get my jacket in a fury of rage and storm out. She follows me ofc telling me to let her explain. So she says he pulled her in to say happy new year and try to put moves on her, but she told him that she's here with her boyfriend and to let her go, she also said they kissed once before and she didn't really want anything to do with him and i can check her phone and ask anybody about anything, aight seems reasonable, he's the asshole not her right?

Then i find out who that guy was and remember that mutual friend told me when i first met my gf that this guy from club was his friend and he was with her for 2-3 weeks before.

Me and my gf are together for 5 months now and things were pretty much perfect except for this incident, we are very much in love and trust each other and she seems even more in love from that incident onwards.

However she doesn't know that i know that she made those 2 little lies :

1. That guy was not her friend, he was her ex.
2. They were together for 2-3 weeks, they didn't just kiss once.

2 little completely unnecessary lies that now make me doubt everything she is saying about that night.

The reason i haven't talked to her about this yet is i can't tell whether it's insecurity spewing out of me or there is an actual problem that needs to be addressed. My friend tells me she told me that because she was embarrassed and didn't want me to worry."|azbekustan|False|https://redd.it/eknmnw|22|0.81|0|9|1|relationship_advice
ekvoa2|2020-01-06 15:36:16|Mother (59) wants a divorce and I (27F) can't put up with my father's (63) abusive behavior.|"Hi. Throwaway for obvious reasons yadda yadda yadda. English is not my native language so I apologize for any weird construction of the sentences.

Today's like boxing day because there's a lot to unpack, so bear with me.

My parents have been married for 30 years and and stopped having sex 10 years ago (or more? I can't tell) because asides from my father's terrible temper, he is also a huge manbaby.

A little context: my mother (will call her Ann) was in a pretty fragile state when she met my father, because her parents died when she was 18 y.o. By chance, my mother's father (my only grandma today, we'll call her Rose) once called at home because she was friend with my Ann's mother and heard about their death through Ann. So Rose visited my mom with my father and after a little acquaintance they started dating.

Fast forward to this, they married and had 2 children: my sister (26F) and I (27F). She had to quit her job to manage us because we were almost the same age, so she became a stay at home mom. My father had to work away from home everyday, sometimes he had to go even further. So he came back home almost every weekend, but he didn't do anything at home, maybe playing a little with us, but never did something like giving us a bath or helping with basic chores. It was my mom's duty. Rose helped, along with my mom's brother and sisters, but it was never my father. My aunt tells me he was always pissed to do basic stuff like putting the babyseat in the car. He just did things on request basically, but never asked if my mom needed help with anything. All he wanted was probably eating, having his laundry done and having a clean home. Anyways, once my father got a transfer, we all moved to another city much closer to his workplace, so, even though it's been painful for my mom leaving his relatives behind, she did it for the family. At least she thought my father would have the energy to be a more present, interested father, but of course it wasn't. On top of that, my mom managed finances, grocery, home etc. My father doesn't even know if the bills are being paid.

I have very little happy memories about my father to be honest, all erased by his inconsiderate behavior towards my mother and us.

First of all, he doesn't have basic hygiene. He has never brushed his teeth, and uses a toothpick. He doesn't have any interest in keeping the house tidy, and doesn't care about basic stuff like washing your ass after you poop, or cleaning the toilet after that. He is a very picky eater: the list is long, but for example he doesn't eat fish, or raw tomatoes, or garlic, or peas, or any different stuff than his mother (Rose) used to cook for him. He is kinda deaf, so you have to repeat simple sentences literally shouting. And this makes him extremely grumpy all the time. He tried several hearing aids but that's really just his temper. He is just aggressive with everybody.

He has always been pretty jealous of my mother's care on us (can you be jealous of your own daughters?) and every time he could, he would make a scene in front of other people, shouting and blowing up for the littlest things. He has never apologized for ANYTHING.

When I grew up he would always see us as a nuisance - he had to pick us up, bring us to places. He would always tell me to ""find someone to bring me home"". However, he's always picked me up from meeting points and such - he has never left me on my own. He would just shout and complain about how late it was  for him and didn't want to keep up with any of this adolescent frenzy of hanging out with friends bullshit. So I just started to go out only I someone could give me a ride home afterwards.

At work, he was despised but since he was very good at his job, they would always ask for his help. He was despised to the point he decided to come back for lunch break at home (12 p.m.) and expect my mom to cook a full meal for him way before our lunch time, plus she had to be home by that time to feed him otherwise he would complain or start a fight. Nobody wanted to be near him because of his unreasonable blow-ups for the slightest things.

I still remember when he tried to teach me to read the time on the clock (we live in Europe, we mostly use the 24hrs format). It was a nightmare. I was 5 y.o. and he would shout out of frustration because I couldn't understand it.

We thought that the reason behind his attitude was that he was getting old and frustrated by his working hours, but nothing changed with his retirement. He is still the same high-tempered slob we've been known for years, but he spiced up things by getting way worse. He is interested only in tech stuff, never asks about our lives, he only starts conversation if there's some kind of interest behind(e.g: Hi OP how's your new computer? You know I can upgrade that WI-fi to 5Ghz if you like).

Whenever we rise an argument, he talks about how he's the victim, and how everybody goes against him. Could this be a narcissistic behavior?

His way of dealing with life really has affected my emotional growth. He has been absent all his life. I don't have respect for him nor I recognize him as a parent. He is just a lousy, abusive shitty flatmate that should get his shit together and leave.

Also, during these years my mom had a bad bacterial infection that would cause wounds on her hands but she was expected to do the housework anyway. I mean: my father, being a fucking baby, didn't even know where to start, so he just piled up stuff in the sink. He has this fascinating way of ignoring fights and bad things such as illnesses because he doesn't know how to deal with. He is just plain dysfunctional and isolates himself (all day in front of the TV for instance).

He is so miserable that he compulsively bought a motorbike without telling my mom after we inherited a small amount of money. Yesterday it has been the last straw: again, he made a scene in front of their friends (over for dinner) at 2AM. A friend made a joke about my father, he got angry and started shouting so much that everybody was thinking he was having a stroke. They tried to calm him down but he was furious, then he stormed out and went to the living room. My mom was so ashamed that apologized for him and their friends left. They checked up on her because they feared he could beat her (a thing that he has never done btw.). I wasn't at home, but if I were there, I would have called the police for sure.

Point is: my mom wants a divorce but she doesn't have her own income. I am still studying 3hrs away, and my sister lives and works 15 hours from home.

What can I do? We tried to talk about this but we always end up in huge fights and everything just goes back to ""normal"", which is pretty draining. At this point I don't think he deserves understanding, so there's no way I would drag him to therapy because I fucking hate him and we both want him out.

My mom is partially at fault for his behavior. She has never stepped up against this but always complained (mostly because she doesn't have an income). I don't know what to do.

tl;dr: my mom wants a divorce from my psychological abusive father which is also a slob and a manbaby and we don't know how to handle it because of his anger issues."|throwRAbusivefather|False|https://redd.it/ekvoa2|2|0.67|0|4|1|relationship_advice

However a few days ago he told me something that is making me want to change my mind.

He has a close friendship with a lesbian woman who is in a committed relationship. The couple are both extremely nice and smart women, and they each have high paying jobs. We all hang out regularly, but my relationship with her has always been a little awkward. 

He said that years ago she had asked him to be the father of her baby, and he said yes (before we met). He said that he still feels that he wants to do that for her and she is thinking of having a baby in 2-3 years. 

At first I felt it was very sweet and said that if that’s what he wanted I didn’t have a problem. Now that I’ve had time to think about it, I think it is a naive idea that it would be that simple. The thought that my child and hers having the same father makes me feel sick. I don’t believe he can be a good father to my child and her child. There are so many things to consider, long term and short term. 

Her pregnancy? Parenting? How will the children feel knowing this? Is he financially responsible for her child? I’m not willing to put up with this drama.

I don’t think he would be able to be just a sperm donor and not feel fatherly responsibilities because of the closeness of their friendship. 

My intuition will not let me sleep because of how wrong this situation feels. 

I don’t feel special and the magic future baby feelings  are sour. I feel like I have to ask him to choose me over her.

Please help me find the right words to get me out of this situation. I still love my man, I just think that we need to have another conversation."|sageandsanto|False|https://redd.it/ekyrgs|1|0.6|0|9|1|relationship_advice

Over that time it slowly turned from once a week booty call kinda situation to spending the entire weekend together. A few months ago I brought up that I had feelings and that I couldn’t do the FWB anymore. He was really upset about it and said he had feelings but was scared etc... we stopped seeing each other and taking.. we then somehow kept finding our way back to each other and started hanging out more and more. Every time we did it just felt ‘right’. In the end it felt like a relationship not a FWB. After such a nice weekend with him I decided that it had to end for good, because I just couldn’t keep doing the casual thing. To my surprise he actually wanted to ‘try’ the whole offical dating thing. We spent 3 day’s straight with each other and it was so lovely. He deleted Tinder without me even asking and he has been super nice, talking over text more than normal. 

Now this is where I need advice. I’ve been single for maybe 10 months and before that I was in a 6 year relationship. I have forgotten what it is like at the start of a new one. I feel like if I message too much or if I ask to hang out I’m being annoying or I’ll ‘scare’ him off. But I know I need to keep talking for it to even work haha
He seems a bit shy/scared to message first or ask to hang out but he always messages me back straight away if I message him

I’m so happy to be with him because I honestly really like him :)

I'm devastated. He got tested for stds at my request  and sent me evidence of the rapid results (clean) and will send me the rest when they come in. No he didn't even respect me enough to use a condom. I obviously will not be letting him touch me for a decent bit of time and he is okay with that.

ekyp9e|2020-01-06 19:14:52|My (20F) bizarre PMS paranoia about fiance (27M) masturbating|"Hey, so to preface I get severe PMS and random anxiety during it. I'm usually a very level headed person so this is totally out of character for my brain and I feel like my head is swimming!  I'm naturally laid back so looking for answers.  Let's call my fiance A for simplicity, we have been together 2yr.

My sex life isn't great.  We have sex a few times a week, it's definitely not a DB, but with his medications (pregabalin, then anti depressants) causing him to struggle to cum + having a much lower sex drive than I do, sex with A can be stressful as I feel I'm not good enough.  We occasionally involve porn together which I don't mind but am not a huge fan of either - it's hot but I think can heighten standards unfairly for sex and makes me feel insecure about not being able to make A cum quickly.

He admitted whilst very drunk that he occasionally tries to masturbate and see what happens - it was implied it worked.  I brushed this off drunk because, who gives a flying fuck?

Then he struggled today, my PMS hit ragingly, and boom.  I'm an irrational mess crying because he masturbated, even though I asked him if he did (to try and show interest in his sex issue and make suggestions) and he said no.  So I believe most of this paranoia and insecurity is due to him lying, but I can accept this is a very small lie and shouldn't elicit much of a reaction...so why has it?!  I feel this fear of missing out, like because his sex drive is so much lower, I need to be involved so that our sex life is healthy.  I wish I didn't care so much about this, and most of the time I don't - PMS has hit hard! 

Can any men weigh in, or women in a similar position?

It's a crazy insecurity, I know he still fancies me even if he touches himself, I just can't help but feel second best to the bathroom tiles and his hand.  I'm a fairly good looking girl and he loves me a lot so I don't understand why I got so upset about this.

Does your bf masturbate and does it bother you? Guys have you ever had someone freak out over it?

PS I acknowledge this is dumb so please be kind, I don't want to feel like this and I know rationally masturbation is healthy and natural.  This is embarrassing and odd."|ukjungle|False|https://redd.it/ekyp9e|1|1.0|0|3|1|relationship_advice
ekyoub|2020-01-06 19:14:00|Lost my 23/M virginity to my current and only serious girlfriend 24/F|"I lost my virginity rather late at the age of 22 to my current girlfriend who is almost two years older than me. I had the curiosity to ask her about her past relationships and sexual past. 

She has slept with just over 10 guys meanwhile I have only slept with her. I truly love her but I have the insecurity to think of this dynamic being uncommon, especially since I am serious about this relationship and intend to be with her for the long term. 

What reassurance or simple advice can you offer me? To an extent, I believe this is retroactive jealousy whilst also questioning of values. How common is this?"|kanye4pope|False|https://redd.it/ekyoub|1|1.0|0|4|1|relationship_advice
ekyoav|2020-01-06 19:12:54|Me (31M) and friend (30M) - boundaries and expectations|"Hi all - a bit of background - I have been through several mental health issues over the past decade and therefore have struggled to make many close friends. I do have different groups of friends but have always craved that close friendship that I'm always chasing.

I met someone last year who was my personal trainer and get along well with. We went out for coffees and drinks and also a couple of nights out. As usual, I escalated things in my head and wanted this person to become a close friend.

What I really need now is some perspective. We do hang out from time to time and it's sometimes at his suggestion but I feel like the friendship is a bit one-sided (on my part). But then I don't know if I'm expecting too much. My gut is telling me that he only contacts me more proactively when he wants something but there are times when this is not the case. 

I'm really not very good at reading social cues and this kind of one-on-one friendship is relatively new for me (I tend to fall into situational friendships with people I have worked with/studied with/lived with in the past). So my question really is - how do I go about finding out if this is a real friendship? What should my expectations be? There's also the blurring of the boundaries with him being my personal trainer and also a friend. Like I said, I sometimes feel it is one-sided and I am being used; other times it seems genuine."|ExpressGreen|False|https://redd.it/ekyoav|1|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice
ekt0e3|2020-01-06 11:38:54|Me 25M exgf 25F breakup|"First I just want to start by saying THANK YOU, thank you so much for your guy's time. I really dont have anywhere else to go to for advice, Went to my older brother and he just called it ""Puppy love"" and didnt offer any advice but just ""forget about her"" and thats it.... extremely disappointing, anyway let me get started

So my exgf (25F) broke up with me (25M) on November 6th 2019. During the 1st month of the breakup We still followed each other on snapchat, facebook, insta and twitter She even made a new snapchat and added me. Her reasons to make this new snapchat was because her old one had too many friends she didnt keep in touch with anymore But i feel the real reason was because her 1st snap had her first and last name in the username and i feel like she didnt want to give that information out to any new people she might meet

. But my dumbass every so often would send old picutres of us together and would tag her in relationship instagram posts. So that lead her to block me on all social media platforms. I dont know why i thought it was a good idea to be doing that especially since i never was getting a response or a reaction from her. But i felt just so alone once she broke up with me, we would do everything together and she was a BIG support in my life. Throughout the relationship i was a constant smoker (weed) and i wasnt going anywhere in life. She was working at a call center and ended up helping me big time get a job there. It really didnt last long (3 months) for me. call centers isnt my thing figured that out later. But they dont drug test so what other option did i have vs working fast food. I was extremely disappointed in myself Bc i felt like i let her down. But when i was working every paycheck id get i would treat her to taking her out to eat and buy her some things but like i said it didnt last long. I continued to be unemployed and she kept working and continue to support me with us having fun at her expense, witch made me feel really worthless but i knew i had to step up my game. I applied at another call center and SAME THING, didnt last long. After that we knew that call centers wasnt my thing. 

So eventually i got a night stocker position and things turned out great. i was there for almost a year. But i began to realize that i couldn't do this forever, i have to upgrade my life if i want to make real money to support a family and start to get serious with this girl. We talked about this before and we both would talk about our future together. So I founded welding im from texas and this is really popular if and you can make serious money. this was perfect so i found a school and started attending. Well during that time i started to not see her as much. sometimes for even 2 weeks. I just didnt feel like making the time for her and i didnt feel like socializing. We would still text and call but thats about it. Also my school was a 30 min drive and coming back from school her house was on the way. Just take a exit off the highway and in no time id be there, i would stop sometimes but not as often as i should. I also stopped sleeping over at her house and it began to only be on weekend where she would come to my apartment and we would spend time together. But she was mostly in my room, while i was with my roommates smoking weed and STILL not giving her the time she wanted with me... This went on for 6 months and 1 month before i finished school she called it quits.... I forgot to mention b4 we met we both contracted hsv1 and hsv2 (herpes) so dating her was EASY bc there is no risks and it was just all around easier 

Now that we are broken up she was being really distant and she would tell me that shes DONE and wants to be single and not have to be committed to anyone so i went NC for 1 month and in that process i was drinking and trying to forget her. Whenever id think about her id stop myself and would try my best to just forget about this girl. One day i gave up. i realize that i LOVE her so much so not trying to get her back would be stupid of me. Here is where im at now. She had already came to get most of her things from my apartment when we first broke up but i still have some stuff of hers, so id use her items as a way to get her to come over and talk to her about getting back. When she would come she wouldnt be mean or anything. she would come inside and we would go to my room where i had her stuff already in bags and we would talk. 

I would always use the ""herpes"" thing as a way to get her back by saying "" we should love each other, we need eachother bc b4 this we were both lost"" and id say other things in that nature. I began to realize that this wasnt the way to try to get her back That has nothing to do with why we loved eachother in the first place. So today Jan 6th 2020 i asked her to come over to get more things that i found. But since we didnt spend Christmas or new years together i had a good idea to buy her some gifts and surprise her with that I got her $70 worth of make up and Projector headlights for her mustang $120 these headlights normaly cost $380 but i found them brand new in the box for a amazing deal on ebay. 

I wrapped up everything and when she came over i started with apologizing on using the herpes thing as a cop out to try to get her back and it was wrong of me. So i gave her other LEGIT reasons why we should be together how ive quit smoking and ive been sober since the breakup and i feel like ive changed so much. And I am so desperate to show you how far ive come. Also i explained to her that she really does not know what shes losing, bc she has never seen me like this before and she hasn't experienced the ""new me"" . And she was very understanding but she told me that shes been working on herself by going to the gym everyday and she just wants to be single and try dating. Not in a serious way but she just want to see whats out there and go and have fun and not be committed to anyone she told me that shes been on 2 dates already. 1st one was shitty and the 2nd one she had fun (nothing sexual). she said that he does not know about the herpes bc she feels like its nothing serious between them so there is no point she just wants to have a good time but she said who knows were it COULD go... that got me worried . I told her ""hey we could go out and have a good time too sometime if you would want"" she laughed and smiled but didnt say much about that. Made me feel a little better about my chances that this guy was noting more but a distraction.... for now hopefully 

we talked a little more and i asked her what did she get for chirstmas from her mother and older sister. She didnt get much just some clothes and a perfume. And thats when i presented to her the gifts i got for her(make up 5 boxes). it was a little difficult to get her to accept all 5 of them but she did. And when i brought out the headlights (one BIG BOX) she said ""that better not be for me"" and she started to cry and said she felt like shit bc she didnt get me anything and she didnt even think about getting me anything at all. And i told her not to feel that way bc this is just a symbol of my appreciation to her. She loved everything. But her sister was texting her that she needed help at the house so she said she needed to leave. I helped her get the things in her car and we talked a little more outside. She said If i would like to be friends, but just friends nothing more. And i said yes. Then i asked her if she could unblock me on the social media platforms. She said that she would think about it but if she does NOT TO TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP i agreed and She got into her car and i said ""friends go to the movies too ya know lol"" she said i know, but we will see what happens. told her text me when u get home. and she left. she texted me and after that we texted like 2 or 3 messages and that was it. i may be leaving some thing out but its almost 4AM and i cant sleep also i might add, she told me that she hasnt had sexual intercourse bc of risks and she does not want to give herpes to anyone. Im in the same boat.

What do you guys think? i want her back and i also told her that everyone deserves a 2nd chance. I am super serious about the relationship this time around. Like i said I cut off weed from my life and im not looking back never going back. I would spend my last dollar on it rather then using it on her. I feel like this was the best thing that could have happen, her asking to be friends is a step in the right direction i feel. even if she said she does not want to lead me on and wants to only be friends. Feelings could change and she might want more."|Ercism|False|https://redd.it/ekt0e3|2|0.86|0|4|1|relationship_advice
ekymt6|2020-01-06 19:10:07|My[26F] FWB guy[27M] says he's too busy to make plans, but is lying or avoiding me?|"(The other two people are both women, but I don't know their age except to say they're roughly our age)

So I’ve had this friend for 10 years, and a while back we started sleeping together. He’s also been sleeping with other girls which mostly I’ve been okay with, but recently this problem has popped up and I’ve been really upset and he’s seemingly upset that I’m upset about it. 

A couple of weeks ago he invited me over for a threesome with another woman, Jane, he’s also been sleeping with. I said sure, and he told me to come over and she would join us in a little bit when she got off of work. I went over, him and I had sex and then he got a message from Jane saying she’d been a bit confused by what he was saying and that she doesn’t want a threesome as she’d had issues with it in the past, so if I was already there she just wouldn’t come. He told me about this, and then said I should stay but then messaged her “come over” (Turned out he was really drunk at the time which I didn’t know until then). I told him twice he needed to decide whether he wanted me to stay or whether he wanted her to come, because he’d need to message her back to tell her not to come. He kept saying he wanted me to stay, but would not message her. I tried to get him to three times. He said he felt bad about having to cancel on her now and didn’t want to do that. So, not wanting him to feel like shit over the situation I told him not to worry about it, I’d go home and we could just do our thing again soon to make it up to me. 

He didn’t message me for a few days, and so I messaged him if he was free, he said he wasn’t for the next few days. I tried again another day and he was also busy. After the third time of trying I figured, fair enough, he really is a busy guy (he’s basically always been busy for the whole time I’ve known him). So I told him I’d like to plan a day to hang out whenever he next has some free time, and suggested revitalizing beer night where we and a few friends would hang out at his place and I’d stay over. He said he was busy for the next 7 weeks, but he thought he might have some free time the next week and would get back to me. A few days ago, I saw him really briefly for an errand we had to get done, and asked him again about hanging out and he said he was busy this week, but maybe next week.

Back in November, our friends had planned to have an event and do some shrooms, and during errands he had mentioned he wanted to limit drug and alcohol use for a while, so I messaged him after to ask if he wanted me to hold back on planning this event because some of the others were talking to me about it. He said he’d love to do it (he’s limiting other drugs, that he’d done more habitually), so I asked if we should plan it for March since he’s busy for seven weeks. He sent me a message saying “Most of my weekends in Jan are free. I’d love to do it soon”. Then he messaged me saying that message was actually meant for Jackie, another woman he’s sleeping with, that he’s making plans with and so got confused and thought my message was from her, but he’d be free to do the shrooms event in Jan too. I told him I was confused because he said he’d be busy for the next 7 weeks. He said he had weekends free, and sent me a screenshot of his calendar so I could plan the shrooms thing.

On it, was dinner plans with Jane. I asked him if there was any reason he didn’t want to hang out with me. He said “No. There's no reason. I am busy. Truly.” I responded that he didn’t seem to busy for anyone else, and mentioned the dinner plans with Jane and the message to Jackie. He said “Jane I bailed on without notice. So I owe her a dinner. Which I don't necessarily want to do.” So I responded how he basically made me leave to have sex with her and why didn’t he feel he owed me anything for that. At this point, he explained that he had actually never did see her that day because he fell asleep once I left and didn’t hear her calls.

I apologized and said I didn’t know that, but that I had been feeling kind of crappy about the way he’s been treating me the last few months. He doesn’t talk to me at parties anymore like he used to, he’ll message me for booty calls (which I said was okay, and it would be, but it’s all I get now, where we used to hang out at like 11 and go have sex at midnight or 1), so now the only times I see him I basically come to his house, he starts taking off me clothes at the door without a word, we have sex, fall asleep, and in the morning I get dressed and leave. He used to make me coffee in the morning and we'd chat for a bit before I left. He'd sometimes drive me home. One time we were going to a dinner party and then a friend’s birthday party afterwards and I figured “Awesome! We’ll get to catch up on the ride over”. Nope. He spent the whole ride chatting up the uber driver. I think the last time we had an actual conversation was July. I told him I’m beginning to feel a bit used. He basically responded with he’s told everyone he’s busy, he enjoys my company but if it requires actions on his part that I “view reflective of appreciation that's required from sleeping together” then we shouldn’t do it anymore. The sex shouldn’t come with conditions, and this isn’t what the FWB thing was supposed to be about.

I really don’t want to be angry with him, and I know I have a habit of overreacting to things, and I’d just love some different perspectives and whether what I’m asking for here is too much.

TL;DR FWB basically made me leave to have sex with the other girl after a failed threesome, said he'd make it up to me but has been avoiding making plans while saying he's busy. Told a woman he's sleeping with that he has plenty of free weekends, and has also made dinner plans with another woman. I feel used, he says he feels like us having sex shouldn't come with conditions."|ThrowRAcndjsnjksn|False|https://redd.it/ekymt6|1|1.0|0|5|1|relationship_advice
ekylo5|2020-01-06 19:07:48|Having a tough time getting over things|"Long story short, I recently had a 2+ year relationship end when I found out she had been sleeping with another guy. Don't get me wrong though, we not only broke up several times in the past, but we both brought our own issues to the relationship. It just wasn't healthy, and despite some really amazing times, there were a lot of really toxic times too.

I'm really struggling to get over it lately. My friends have been super supportive, and I've been doing tons with them lately, even if it's just texting them more while I'm working. They've all been wonderful, and I really owe it to everyone who stuck it through for me.

But nearly every night, I find myself trying desperately to distract myself. She keeps emailing me, and I keep writing drafts to her, but forcing myself not to send them. In the past when we've broken up, it's been so much easier - but this time realizing that I was on a leash for at least 2 months while she was involved with at least one other guy really wrecks me. I realize I had my own flaws to fix to be better to her, but I was truly working my ass off (and making great progress) in fixing some of those. Now I look back and feel like I was just kept in a cage while giving up my time and money to help her in any way I could, and it's devastating.

I picked up some negative coping techniques the last several months of dating, namely kratom, nicotine, and some drinking, and I've done a really good job of cleaning those up and getting back in shape since things ended. Been trying to work more, do more, fill my schedule up, and think about what I really want in my future now that I feel more in control of it. All good stuff.

But every night I just stare at the emails she sends, saying she wishes we could cuddle, and telling me how poorly she's doing. But for the sake of my own life, I can't go back this time. I can't forget spending Christmas curled up on my bed, not eating or drinking water, thinking I'd be better off dead. They say when you're actually considering letting yourself go, you won't tell anyone or reach out for help, and for the first time in my life, I felt that. My phone was buzzing off the hook, and I just ignored it, hoping in another hour the pain would stop somehow. During the second day of that, I finally forced myself to text a friend back (who had been calling/texting me frantically) and told him I needed help. A few of my friends showed up a couple hours later and saved me. She was doing the same, saying she was worried about me, but I just couldn't comprehend how somebody could claim to care after insisting there was nobody else, yet there was.

In the past when we've ""broken up"" I felt free and made the mistake of diving right at someone else. I haven't this time, nor do I want to, nor do I think I'm able to. I just can't wipe the memories and questions away, and the urge to stand up for myself and tell her how I feel is exceptionally strong. It's even harder this time as it really whacked my self esteem badly. Our sex was probably the best I've ever had (especially because it was so meaningful, and I found her so attractive), and I feel in a way rejected now thinking that I wasn't enough.

I'm doing everything I can to care for myself and get my life back, but it's just so painful. I know if I go back it'll probably kill me in some shape or form, so there's no way I can. Not to mention the self respect for myself."|Bigmealplantime|False|https://redd.it/ekylo5|1|1.0|0|4|1|relationship_advice

We've been dating for 8 months since meeting at uni. She sort of has a weird sense of humour but it's never really bothered me. At the moment we're both home for Christmas so we send each other nudes.

She sent me some pictures and videos and I sent her a video of me ejaculating and then we just chatted casually for a bit. Then she texts me saying 'please don't kill me' and I said 'why?'.

I then get a photo message- a screenshot of the moment I began to cum with spiderman photoshopped on the head of my penis so it looks like he's shooting my cum from his hands. I honestly felt a bit baffled why she would send me this or even take the time to photoshop it so I just didn't reply to her. She messaged me an hour later and said 'hey I'm sorry if you found that to be immature and unfunny. I was being silly, I love your body so much and I'm sorry I made a joke out of it'. 

I know I should have probably replied to this but I just don't really know if i feel respected by her. Like she said 'please don't kill me' before sending it so surely she knew it would sort of bother me?

ekyisa|2020-01-06 19:02:01|Would love some advice on dieting while living with a partner that wants nothing to do with it!|"I’m 25f my boyfriend is 27m. We’ve lived together for a couple years now, and since we got together about 4 years ago both of us have gained significant weight- at least 50 pounds each.

He has some mild anxiety surrounding food- he’s extremely picky and if he doesn’t like something that I’ve made, he gets very defensive, almost angry at me for trying to fix it by making him something new or suggesting some stuff we have that he can make- I just feel bad since I prepare 85% of our meals. He will just not eat, and then sometimes he’ll have an attitude or be in a bad mood for the night because he’s hungry. So, I’ve let myself get into a kind of shitty habit of just making things I know he likes- things like tacos, pasta, etc. I need to start a diet for my health- something that I can really stick with- so I can’t just be making super rich foods all the time. I know the obvious choice is to just make him what he wants and then have something different but I don’t know if I could bring myself to make something like Mac and cheese for him and then turn around and make something else or heat up something low calorie for me. It’s just too difficult and would not be sustainable. On top of all this, I have tried to get him to choose snacks and other foods he can easily prepare himself that I can buy at the grocery store and he basically refuses to do this. It is starting to cause me stress because he can be grumpy when we don’t have anything he wants, but he won’t tell me what he wants.

For those of you in similar situations- what strategies helped you? Any recipes that are good for picky eaters that are genuinely low cal? And is it ever going to hurt less when he puts A1 on the steak I seasoned and cooked for him without tasting it first?"|fuckthepolice4206969|False|https://redd.it/ekyisa|1|1.0|0|8|1|relationship_advice
ek8wyo|2020-01-05 05:49:09|Boyfriend [21M] took my [18F] birth control pills during sex and is obsessed with the thought of pregnancy.|"I was very uncertain whether to publish this or not but after giving it some thought, I came to the conclusion that I have to let my emotions flow free for once. 
As the title suggested, a few days back me and my boyfriend were spending quite the quality time together and were having fun. 
Important to mention would be his apparent obsession when it comes to the topic of pregnancy or impregnation specifically. 
Whenever we are having sex, sooner or later he will talk about how my body was made to carry his child and how good I'd look pregnant.
Usually it's part of the usual dirty talk since I saw no harm in participating in those kind of things before, especially since the topic dropped pretty fast after he is done and all satisfied. 

Fast forward a bit and he started casually mentioning when and at what age I'd be ready for a baby. To my reply ""ranging between 23 to 26"", he simply nodded and dropped the topic again...until a day later or so:


Him: ""You know that the perfect age is between 18 and 24 right?""
Me: ""What? I thought 20 to 25"" 
Him: ""If nature intended you to become pregnant at 20, then it would've made sure youd be fertile not before that age, isn't that correct.""
Me: ""So...?""
Him: ""I'm just saying it would be mean to not give your body what it wants. Like, you're already 18 and grown, if not now when then?"" 

Honestly, I don't know why or what came over him but lately he is giving it so much thoughts it's crazy, including casual comments ALL the time.
""You better push a boy out of your pussy"", ""You know, I'd have no idea how to raise a daughter"", ""No look, first the baby then marriage."".
Not to mention when we were over at his house and looked at some cute old pictures of him:
""Aw, look at that, it's a tiny [bf]!""
""You know, I can always give you a tiny [bf] if you want that. Just have to ask nicely.""
And so on and so on. 

Now to my current 'problem'.
Like said in the title, few days back me and my boyfriend fricked in the morning after waking up (I take my pill at around 7am usually) and when I said I'd have to take it now, he pretty much grabbed the package, snatched it out o9f my hand and kept thrusting into me. 
My wrist were pretty much held into place by his hands so aside from begging him he shall give them back, there was not much else to do.
He didnt stop, neither did he give them back.

""I'll fuck you for hours straight, better forget those pills now and enjoy it while it lasts"". 

Eventually though I felt him releasing into me and during Post orgasm haze I got to swallow my pill with a good 30 minute delay, the whole process was watched by a smirking boyfriend.
While it wasnt a horrible experience that makes me want to run to the police, it was weird and scary. 
I dont know how to feel, honestly.
He is not known to be very gentle or sweet and overall has very VERY misogynistic views, such as ""Youd stay home with the kid anyway, no need to study at the university"", ""Just imagine how nice itll be for us in a bit. Me coming home from work and you'll have cooked and cleaned for me. Dont worry, I'll fuck you good as reward."" and my personal favourite ""Women are made for breeding, so that's what we should do. You dont need work you need babies"". 

Honestly, I dont even know why I wrote this. I love my boyfriend  a lot and even though he has those views and thoughts I could imagine marrying him and eventually having kids too. 
But after the pill action? 
Phew.
I dont know, honestly. I dont know why I typed this but I guess I had to free some frustration or other emotions. 
Feel free to give your opinion on this topic since I really dont know where I am right now or what I should do.

EDIT 1: 
After seeing so many comments and ideas, I gave it more thought and came to the conclusion that I'd much rather confront him than just run away. 
But how should I do that?
How do I approach this topic with him?
Should I include a close friend of mine or should I go alone?"|sappyangel666|True|https://redd.it/ek8wyo|954|0.92|0|362|1|relationship_advice
ekyf4t|2020-01-06 18:54:51|I (23M) have recently had strange gut feelings questioning my 2 1/2 year relationship with my girlfriend (23F)|"Over the past week or two I have experienced these gut feelings that question my love for my girlfriend and whether I really want to be with her long term. I have had small doubts here and there in our relationship in the past, but we have been able communicate about them and move forward. These feelings are way more intense, even to the point where I brought myself to tears last night thinking about breaking things off with her. 

I really do love her and care for her greatly and we get along great, have fun together, have similar values and goals in life. We have talked about our future together a lot and just recently I expressed to her that I might want to wait a little longer to get engaged or married than we originally planned on because I feel like we should have our careers more established and should wait till we are a little more financially stable, and she said that she understand and agrees, all that matters to her is that she is with me. And she wants me to be sure that I want to be with her and I am not just settling with her. 

Her saying this has kind of stuck with me and has consumed all my thoughts and emotions for the past couple of days. I felt insincere when I told her that I want to be with her long term for some reason. I feel like I need to be straight up with her about my thoughts and feelings right now because they are constantly gnawing at me. 

I do not know what to do right now, because I love her so much and care for her greatly and I do not want to hurt her in anyway. The thought of not having her in my life sounds like the most painful experience in my life, I just can’t imagine not being able to talk with her or be with her. And I know it will crush her too because she loves me and wants to be with me forever. I really need some advice.

Should I bring these feelings and thoughts up with her? 

Are these gut feelings telling me to break up with her?

Should we try and take a break from each other? 

Please, any advice will help."|FlatPanncake|False|https://redd.it/ekyf4t|1|1.0|0|17|1|relationship_advice
ekyf38|2020-01-06 18:54:46|Boyfriends best friend refuses to respect my boundaries..|"Hi all,
Ill try to be as brief as possible but i guess im looking to see if i am expecting too much and if i deserve the abusive text i got sent today.
Basically, my f 37 and bf 36 have been together 1 year. He has a female best friend 30 of 3. 5years, met on a trace Facebook group, who he shared a kiss with 3 years ago. He stopped the kiss, she asked why and he said they were just friends and he didn't want yo ruin what friendship they shared. She met someone soon after and has been with the guy 2 years. Fast forward, my boyfriend falld in love with me and we are blissfully happy..
She writes up on social media i love you and he was saying it back (platonic) a LOT. I didn't like how it made me feel when this was shared publicly and how it reflected on me as his gf.
I asked him to stop and asked her to stop doing it publicly, but had zero issues with their friendship and they could tell eachother till the cows came home hoe much they loved eachother, but just not for the world to read and its sister!
There were back and forths as she doesn't believe in boundaries, andbi hold them dearly. She said she was freedom and fluid! But she would respect my boundaries.
So, as i expected she done it a few times since. My boyfriend kindly asked her to stop again, and i get a very nasty text today telling me how childish i am, that i am ridiculous, that she can not fathom why it bothers me, that i don't know what my boyfriend is going through and i am causing him so much trouble! That if i loved him like i proclaim to do, i should let it go.. And that i am just hurting myself as she is going nowhere!
Now.... Forgive me if i am wrong... But to back up the truck, i have been nothing but nice to this girl and my boyfriend confirms this. Did i deserve this, for just calling someone out on crossing my boundary... Which i don't believe is unreasonable at all???
Please help guys im absolutely heartbroken over this..
She has shown manipulation, gaslighting, egotistical views and very narcissistic 
I believe its my boyfriend's responsibility to sort out, and through niceness, i just wrote back wow and blocked her fron messaging me again.

ekye22|2020-01-06 18:52:32|Is my husband also interested in men?|"I'm in an incredibly loving and happy marriage. We have been together about 5 years. I'm new to Reddit and have recently found that it is littered with porn. Well my phone was dead last night and my husband never has a problem with me playing games and browsing instagram, etc on his. I was looking at his Reddit because it's a lot more interesting than mine. I found he follows a good amount of porn, along with hundreds of other subjects. I don't care at all, I think porn is normal and healthy and isn't looking in excess of anything.

Well I found a couple of gay porn tags that he has followed, again not super unnormal, I watch girl on girl sometimes. But then I saw in his messages that right before we were together and he was supposed to meet up with a man to exchange oral sex.. A bit weird on reddit? But I'm kind of shocked. And I feel like I've completely crossed a trust boundary. I wasn't looking for anything or even trying to snoop.. I wouldn't mind if he experimented before me, we've just always been very open with eachother. I'm now also thinking back to not long after we got together a gay co-worker of ours said that he saw him on grindr, he was one to start rumors and was an add so he laughed it off and I never really thought about it again but now I'm just confused.

ekr54a|2020-01-06 08:16:39|I’m a male and I’m having abuse problems with my girlfriend. Please help with some advice.|"I’m 23 years old. My girlfriend is 21. We’ve been friends for years on Facebook and finally decided to meet up and we hit it off right away. We’re now 6 months into our relationship. Both of us have major trust issues from past relationships, anxiety, depression, etc. 

Let me start this off from one night in particular. I took her out on a date about 3 months into our relationship. Just me and her. We ate and was going to play some pool. She said she had 2 guy friends she hadn’t seen in a while a few towns over that would buy us drinks if we came to see them. Well, we go to this bar and it’s packed. I don’t drink much bc my dad was an alcoholic. I have severe social anxiety and I’m prescribed klonopins for it. We get to the bar, I don’t really plan on drinking so I take a kpin to stop the panic attack from all the people in there. We meet these friends. I had already told her I didn’t feel comfortable going, and if she wanted to hang with them we could meet somewhere besides a bar for the first time but she insisted. So. They’re taking shots and one of the guys pulls me over and tells me to drink with them. I tell him I’ve taken some medicine I can’t drink on and I’ll pass. He says if I don’t drink he’s not going to buy any more for us and I’ll have to pay. I don’t have much money so I take a shot. And he keeps blackmailing me to take them until I walk away and play pool. I play pool all night by myself. 5 hours or so. Eventually the bar closes down and I have to drive these 2 dudes home. My girls having a panic attack and one of them asks if he can rub her shoulders to calm her down while I’m driving. I said it’s fine bc they’re friends. Well I’m driving fine and I feel sober. We stop so she can pee and I fall asleep at the gas pump. She gets out and comes back to the car and I’m awake again. Perfectly fine. We’re almost to their house and I look over and his hands all over her neck and in the front of her neck and her head is back and she’s enjoying it. I slam the brakes and pull over and just go off on this dude about respecting boundaries and if he don’t stop we can settle it like men. He apologizes and my girl yells at me. I get to their house. My girl has to Pee again (she has bladder problems). Once again, I fall asleep once we stop. I wake up and she’s still not out so I knock on the door and she comes out with them and says she was puking in the bathroom. I know nothing happened bc the time was only 10 minutes later. We say bye and head home. This is where it gets bad. At some point we pull over and she’s yelling at me for getting onto him and she throws my klonopins (which I haven’t taken since the one at the bar) out the window calling me a drug addict (they’re prescribed), and then I don’t remember anything. The next thing I remember I’m pulled over at a truck stop and she’s knocked out. She says I hit her and choked her and I don’t remember anything of it. I drive home balling my eyes out bc I have never done anything like this before. I get home to my mom and just cry and tell her what happened. 

I expected her to leave but she eventually forgave me and gave me a chance to fix it. I stopped drinking completely, stopped going to bars. I later found out she had deleted messages with her ex and deleted messages with the guy at the bar. I also got back into therapy and my psychiatrist. The only problem is. Her own dad told me she attacked her mom once then went to the bathroom and they caught her punching herself and choking herself. I’m scared she did the same but I don’t want to be that person to say I didn’t do anything wrong so I’m taking it and trying to better myself. 

The recurring problem is we’ve had another psychical altercation tonight. When my anxiety gets severe, I need a hug or just to be touched to be “grounded” and calmed down. But when im freaking out and I ask her to she says I’m just making it all about me bc she’s upset too. So it overwhelms me and i hit my head with my hands or pace around the room. If I have my medicine I take it but I get called a drug addict if I do. Ever since that night when we get into a bad enough argument and my anxiety goes over the top she instigates so much to get me to react. Tonight she got into my face. Broke my necklace off my neck that my dear friend gave to me and broke it. Three things at me. And started trying to swing at me so I threw her off me onto the bed and told her to calm down I’m not going to hit you. She threw multiple things in my face. 

I just don’t know what to do. Part of me wants to leave bc I know this isn’t healthy. But when we’re not fighting everything is perfect. She just plays the victim after instigating the fights. I just need advice on what to do to ease the situation down so it doesn’t turn psychical. I’m not looking for a “you need to break up” please. I want to TRY to fix it before giving up. I try to seperate myself but she either follows or messages me on fb or waits for me to get back. I need advice on how to calm my anxiety down so I don’t snap and put my hands on her at all, not even self defense. I don’t hit her past the night I don’t remember. I don’t emotionally abuse her. I just want her to understand if she just holds me for a second or touches me it would stop me in my tracks and ease my anxiety and I’d calm down but she won’t listen and only wants to argue more and instigate the fight.

————

My boyfriend cheated on me but says we weren’t in a relationships after 7 months. To make it seem acceptable except I’m not the casual and fwb type of girl. I was a virgin. He told me in November he loved me but now he says that’s different from I’m in love with you. I drove 12 hours to see him because he had invited me but then when I found out about the cheating he didn’t want to yet I came here. Don’t say how it was a bad move bc I knew if I didn’t then I would’ve regretted not trying. I thought we could spend time like we wanted together and see how things went. We lived in the same town for the majority of the time and he only moved there on November temporarily. My guess is he moved in with a girl recently bc he wouldn’t give me his address. He had invited me to stay with him before. He even told me on Christmas Eve to visit him. He knows I’m alone, only have my car and it’s freezing here besides I live in a hot place so I’m not used to this at all. Many miles away from home. He wouldn’t even come see me nor anything. He didn’t send me an address. I know where he lives and the other woman house but I wouldn’t go uninvited. The other woman knows about me. My guess she told him to not see me. Maybe not to even talk to me bc he’s only messaging on Snapchat. Not answering calls nor texts. I brought him his gifts but he didn’t even pickup one that’s big and I didn’t want to take back. I told him to just take it out of my trunk and not see me but he says he doesn’t deserve them. Coming here did improve our communication. 

I did something against my morals and that’s that I contacted someone on Tinder who gave me shelter but obviously lead to protected sex. I slept some hours but it hurts that he didn’t even come see me nor give me shelter. So my mind still sabotages me with sadness and tears. I found his tinder profile too that I didn’t know off. I told him his truths yesterday via messaging and how he was turning his back on me. 


I can predict he’ll want me back when it hits him. Rn he’s likely with the other woman and may sleep around but that’s just casual not like what we built. He’ll figure out that he won’t be able to find someone like me. He’ll question his actions. I think he’s got feelings for me even though he denies it bc of the other woman. I know he hates it there and wants to come back to where I live so it’s likely that I’ll wonder in his mind we he does that

I read about 50% ex get back together. I learned my lessons. If we get back together I’m sure I’ll get commitment from him and I’d have more to say. I’m not letting him do everything his way. I can see how this may help what we have. I don’t know if I’ll take him back but this man will have to try so hard to get me back. To gain my trust and all that stuff. 

I’m going to focus on myself, socializing with new friends, work on a home makeover, go on adventures, and date again. I did check my dating profiles and set up a new one on the app we met so it comes across when he swipes. He may have seen it he wiped and that’s why he reached out or he’ll see it whenever he gets to swiping. I’ll use my old one to date back home. I’m going to focus on being my best version. Building a good stronger body, getting new hobbies, keeping with my hobbies, a new job, straightening a little bottom tooth, and going to university.

I'll sum up my situation. We were friends for 6 years, and together for 1. It didn't work as a relationship, and as such it didn't end on the best of terms. We haven't spoken since, but I still to this day (a few years later) feel bad for the way that it ended. I ended it. He didn't want it to. I've been debating lately whether it's appropriate to reach out & offer an apology for what happened, but is that ever the right thing to do? There's no hidden agendas, I don't want him back, I'm not even sure whether friendship could happen again, particularly as I've moved on since... but something in my conscience would like to clear the air.

eky870|2020-01-06 18:41:24|I (37F) would like to have a second child in the future. My mother (64F) and sister (36F) told me it would ruin my life.|"I (37F) got married just last year to my husband (34M). We decided to try for a baby soon after the wedding because we felt ready to start a family. We both envisioned our family being complete with 2 children as we had each grown up with our own siblings. Luckily, I was able to get pregnant right away. After an easy pregnancy and delivery I gave birth to a healthy baby boy. My mom (who lives in another state 3.5 hours away by plane) was present for the birth of her grandson and stayed to help us for 2 weeks.

Once my mom left to go back home, my husband and I were on our own. We don't know many people where we live so I felt somewhat isolated after I gave birth. I was also afraid to go out with a newborn baby since he wasn't able to get any vaccinations before 2 months of age. The isolation and sleep deprivation were taking their toll. Around 2 months postpartum, I had a sudden onset of intrusive thoughts about harming my baby. I don't have a history of mental illness and the thoughts scared me so much that I went to the ER so I could be seen for a psych evaluation. I was diagnosed with postpartum anxiety and OCD (PPA/OCD) but was reassured that my thoughts, although terrifying, were common and I would never actually physically do something to hurt my baby.

During this crisis, my mom found a flight immediately and flew in to help take care of my baby. She had never seen me in such a horrible emotional state so she stayed with us for about 2 months while my dad was alone back at their home. During recovery I was placed on medication and seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. 

As my mind started to get clearer and my life slowly returned to normal, I would sometimes mention in passing about the possibility of having another baby to which my mom would respond with ""NO! NO MORE BABIES!"" She would say it in a joking way, but the more and more I heard her say it, the angrier I would feel. The fact that she would automatically shoot down the idea of a second child was hurtful. She finally admitted to me that she was saying those things because it was so hard for her to watch her own daughter go through such a scary postpartum phase. 

Since my mother had gone above and beyond to help me, I convinced myself that this was all for the better and that my husband and I were one and done with children. I was aware of the higher risk of having PPA with any subsequent pregnancy. However, my therapist and psychiatrist had reassured me that it was entirely possible to prevent this from happening again -- I have the tools at this point to recognize any PPA/OCD symptoms early on and would be able to get on medication prophylactically soon after the birth of another baby. 

My son is 9 months old now and I am feeling almost 100% back to my normal self. I really enjoy spending time with my baby and haven't had intrusive thoughts in months.  I'm taking care of him completely on my own during the day while my husband is at work. 

Meanwhile, I have a sister that has 2 young children of her own and has repeatedly told me that it's enough to have one child. She likes to remind me that having 1 child is so easy compared to 2. I know what she is saying is true but it doesn't erase the fact that I still want 2 children myself. She also thinks I should be grateful for my healthy son (which I absolutely am) and that I should not risk having a second child due to my age. If my husband and I try for another baby and it doesn't happen for us, then I would be happy being a family of 3 with my son. I just can't help but think about having one more.

Now I feel like I have to keep my desires to myself and if I were to get pregnant again, I'm sure my mom and sister wouldn't be happy for me. I know ultimately this decision is between me and my husband, but I would like to have the support of the rest of my family. Am I letting my mom and sister influence our decisions too much or are they right?"|ThrowRA0o0o0o0o|False|https://redd.it/eky870|0|0.5|0|12|1|relationship_advice
ekv4ue|2020-01-06 14:54:22|My friend(15 F) seems to trust people she's had less lengthy relationships than me(15 M) and I don't know if it has something to do with me.|"So first of i met Mary(not her real name) at a camp i went to along with some of my friends during the summer. During the camp an incident happened with one of Mary's friends that involved 1 of my friends. Basically Mary's friend was ""interested"" in one of my friends since she was trying to get over another boy she wanted a relationship with for over 2 years, the girl gave my friend hints that she was genuinely interested in him. She really wanted to continue with him but last day of the camp the other boy who she wanted a relationship with for 2 years asked her out and she had to make a decision. She ended up not picking my friend and there was some name calling for her between us(the guys) since we were salty on behalf of our friend(you will see later why this is important). So basically after the camp i kept in contact with Mary because she seemed like a fun girl to be friends with. We also created this group on messenger where everyone that was in our team in the camp was in (me, 5 other of my friends,Mary , the friend that rejected my friend, and another friend of the girls) at the time that she rejected my friend we didn't know why she did that (we didn't know who that other boy was). So we used to talk very commonly in that group and everyone seemed to be having fun but i knew all my friends well still salty about what she did, i knew she didn't just do it randomly because i saw it in her eyes that she had some genuine interest in him so i went and asked her. She told me the whole story and it seemed very understanding to me and very logical as to why she did what she did so i cooled off and wasn't mad at her, the problem was that she told me not to tell the guys anything. So the guys were still mad at everyone in there and they pretty much disliked the girls but didn't really show it. Now throughout all this talk in the group i spoke privately with Mary through our own chat and got to know each other really well. We spoke for about 3 months when Mary's friend broke up. Suddenly after the break-up everyone seemed to be okay with the girls and they also started talking with Mary(since they weren't mad anymore) also on their own. Now it's been 2 months after they've been talking and they seem to be very good friends now but i started noticing that she doesn't trust me for certain things even though i've always been SUPER supportive to her. I told her that i genuinely trust her and i tell her pretty much everything. She said she trusts me too but it doesn't seem like it. The other guys know stuff i had no idea about. Forgot to mention the fact that they constantly have arguements with each other but then she carries on to trust them with stuff. I felt like i've done something wrong and i confronted her about it and she said i did nothing wrong. I asked her ""Who do you trust more me or the others?""(out of my jealousy obviously) and she said she trusts everyone equally which seems very unfair to me considering that i've been by her side for over 5 months.

I know it's a very confusing story and you probably have many questions about things i didn't explain very well so please ask me whatever question you feel is necessary."|iWillCringe|False|https://redd.it/ekv4ue|2|1.0|0|0|1|relationship_advice

eky1if|2020-01-06 18:27:57|OPINIONS!! Is it appropriate for my bf of 4 years to go on vacation with two girls from school?|"Hello, I (21F) am in college and my bf (21M)of four years is also in college but we are LDR. We do not have the same break schedule. He is currently on vacation with one of his guy friends and two girls. I said it was okay, changed my mind a bunch of times, and am trying to be okay with it because realistically I didn’t want to be the person that said no you can’t go bc im jealous (and at the end of the day that’s what this is). Seeing the social media posts about the trip from his friends are really hard and im struggling with it. My friends think it’s inappropriate that he’s there with two girls and that it’s weird. His reasoning for going is that he wanted to go with someone who speaks the language (which one of the friends does). They’re all staying together some nights, and to my knowledge he’s been completely truthful about the trip to me and honestly has tried to make me okay with it and dealt with my anxiety around it without complaining. I’m naturally a suspicious person and I just am starting to feel more and more not okay with it and just kinda uncomfy about the whole situation. To make matters somewhat worse we’ve had a bit of a rocky relationship lately (at least from my perspective) and just have been dealing with a lot of stuff. He’s lied to me in the past concerning a whole diff situation and it just has been really bothering me in regards to this trip. To me this feels like a two week long double date, am I being dramatic???

So I guess what I’m looking for is:

Do you think the trip is appropriate/ would you have been okay with it? And now that he’s there, how do I deal with all my emotions??

EDIT: he did ask me first and I did say it was okay but was also not super comfortable from the start. He bought the plane ticket within a few days of asking me. Also he is not sharing a mattress with any of the girls"|MadToons__|False|https://redd.it/eky1if|1|1.0|0|11|1|relationship_advice
eky0z1|2020-01-06 18:26:51|My dad [52/M] just took my car keys and cost me [23/M] a job.|"I got fired from a job last week and I've been searching for a new one ever since. Over the weekend, I got called in for an interview from a local Nike store and my interview was suppose to take place earlier this morning, but it all went to shit once I told my dad about the interview last night. He was already in a pissed off mood because of the Eagles losing, but I wanted to tell him about the interview since he was the one who was up my ass about finding a new job.

I told him that the job was at a Nike store and he immediately told me no. He started rambling on about how Nike was ""un-American"" and he started yelling about Colin Kaepernick being associated with Nike. I honestly haven't been following any Nike news or controversy, so my dad was just coming off like a rambling lunatic. He basically started telling me that he doesn't want me working for Nike, but I assumed that he was just blowing off steam from the Eagle's loss, so I just went to bed.

But this morning I woke up and I couldn't find my car keys. Our house rules are that all personal keys go on a shelf in the living room and I couldn't find them. I asked my dad where they were and he said ""Don't worry about it."" I told him that my interview was today, but he reiterated that I wasn't working for Nike. He also said that if I find any other way to go to the interview (bus, Lyft, Uber, getting a ride from a friend, etc) then he would kick me out of the house. He wasn't bluffing, since he's already kicked me out once before and I didn't want to take any risks. I ended up missing my interview and when I called Nike to apologize and reschedule, the guy simply said that they're no longer interested in me as an applicant. I've heard a lot of really good things about working at Nike, but my dad ruined a potentially great job for me and I'm fucking pissed and not knowing how to deal with him from here."|hamspider|False|https://redd.it/eky0z1|0|0.5|0|7|1|relationship_advice

ekxz8n|2020-01-06 18:23:27|My Boyfriend (24M) refuses to post anything about our rs or me (23F) on his social media|"Hi I’ve finally come to a decision to write about this even after discussions with my LDR boyfriend. Please forgive some grammatical errors as I am writing this in the middle of the night while feeling quite upset. i’ve been in a rs w my boyfriend for a year and a month now whom I met online on a friend-making app. Right now he’s in Japan and I’m somewhere in an asian country. Things were all pretty fine until we went out on dates together after about 7-8 months of being together as that was when he was able to fly back to his homecountry to meet his family and me. Apparently, he said he would’nt have returned home if it werent for me. I was in awe to hear that ofc but i knew he was going home too bc he hadnt seen his family for 1+ year.

Fast forward to when we went out on dates, he would take a lot of photos and some videos of us together but until this day he never has posted any of it YET he posted photos of his 1-to-1 coffee and lunch time w his old female friend at the cafe they went to and inside his friend’s car during his stay at his home country. To be honest, the moment i saw that, my heart broke into pieces and that wasnt the first because I felt like I wasn’t important enough to be shared publicly that way. I feel invisible on his profile. Despite our argument over this, he only had posted a short insta video stories of me driving him around w a caption that says “my driver for today” and he claimed that it was enough to hint to his social media friends that “he is on a date w me”. 

Note that some of our photos together were sent to some of his close friends and his family. (His family turns out to disapprove of our rs because of my religion which is an issue that will be linked to this i believe). But what bothers me is that.. he has uploded photos of his female friends sitting quite close next to him on his profile while being in a rs w me. So, every time it happened, I sort of brought it up to him asking him why would he post photos of other females but not me? His answers were: 1) Because he can’t handle the negativity and backlash from some people (as I said earlier, I’m practicing a religion different from his and his family so he says it has sort of sth to do with that). Plus, his parents are disapproving of our rs  again due to my religion so he doesnt  want his parents to be receiving comments about us from aunties and uncles. 2) he’s not the type that wants to get attention from announcing to the world that he has a gf. Me being me, I had to counter his argument w my opinion saying that I thought it was unfair that he wants to appear single on his social media while I did tell my social media friends once that I have a bf. 

I get it if he’s always been the private person who doesn’t post things but it seems that he’s rather active on it where his insta feed almost seems perfectly curated about his life, his friends, family and the events he has gone to. Clearly, he takes his insta content specifically quite seriously but pls do not that have the idea he’s not some insta star as he only has 280+ followers. So, those conflicts ended up bringing us to find a common ground where none of us should post a photo of the opposite gender that could raise suspicion, leading others to make false assumptions of our rs. 

For one, I’ve never been one who posts photos w males bc it’s my preference to avoid gossips but he has always been this one who would to show the world like “hey heres my female sitting next to me!” Or like “hey here’s me having lunch w her.” Although, it’s not a regular thing, it still does upset me. Might i also add that he refuses to tell his old female friend from highscool that he’s in a rs when they went out for lunch and took a quick walk somewhere to shop gifts for me..it might sound petty but i just thought why not tell her your real intention of going to that store. I felt like it wouldnt hurt if he had just told her that “hey im going to this XX store to get my gf a gift!”. But yeah my point is that he’s not mentioned about me to some of his both good male and female friends which hurt me deeply :( 

recently, he also posted a stories video on insta showing that he was surrounded by his female group members and he was seen sitting close to them as well in an international student program.  Again, i was somewhat heartbroken. To me, it kind of violated the common agreement we had earlier on this idk. even tho he says, “i posted it to show ppl the crowd thru that video but u just focused on the girls around me! I didnt put much thought into it so whatever and sorry you feel that way!” Somehow it felt my feelings were not one of his priorities but his insta feed is. Anyway, long story short, he ended up following the people he met and bnded with from the recent event on his insta which is fine to me but i doubt he has let them know that he’s in a rs.

I am terribly sorry for the long post but please tell me what i can do! :(  am i being unreasonable for wanting my bf to post about me at least one..? 

TL;DR: I feel ignored and my feelings are seem to be put aside because my LDR boyfriend only posts photos of himself and his friends both male and female but doesn’t hint properly to anyone on his social media about his rs status. Made mutual agreements but he seems to have broken it recently."|SeranityNA|False|https://redd.it/ekxz8n|0|0.5|0|9|1|relationship_advice

We are now expecting another daughter in May but I lost my job in November and haven't found a new one. Our lease is up in June so we're looking to buy a home which is already stressful because the market here (SLC, UT) is ridiculous compared to where we're from (ABQ, NM) and we will only have enough for a small down payment OR closing costs, not both.

eknq0w|2020-01-06 02:59:05|Married to a catastrophizer (50F)|"Back when our (55M/50F) daughter (now 16F) was 2, she developed a rare but serious autoimmune condition, which required several years of complex and often-stressful treatment. She has now been in remission for almost a decade and she's been doing great, physically, academically, you name it.  Our problem has nothing to do with the illness, except for what has happened since then.

The problem is that ever since this illness hit from out of the blue, my wife sees potential disasters lurking everywhere she turns. Every cold could be a fatal case of influenza, every headache a brain tumor, every noise in the attic is a rodent infestation and we have to spend $500 on an exterminator, every animal in the yard could be rabid, or carrying ticks (okay, where we live that's actually probable), the cats will die if they escape from the house, the unfamiliar car at the next house belongs to a drug dealer, criminals will break in unless we have multiple layers of locked doors, and that kid walking past the house could be a criminal...you get the idea.

She -can- be talked out of the fear with logic easily enough - long as she hears it from somebody she perceives as an expert.  Under no circumstances can I be the one trying to talk her out of it.  Not successfully, anyway.

I tried pointing out that the worst thing that already happened to us in all the years we've known each other, our daughter's illness, was something nobody could have prepared for or predicted.  She refused to listen, until our daughter's doctor told her the very same thing.

I get wanting independent confirmation (I used to be a journalist), but damn.

ektfb6|2020-01-06 12:19:27|Was it my fault that things went that way? And if not, how am I supposed to trust again?|"
Almost five years ago, I moved from my home country and started a new life in a completely different place (China), that has a culture that is almost 180 degrees different from my native one. But I was willing to learn and accept it, it was my choice to move after all. One year and a half after I moved, I met a guy. He was younger than me, but this didn’t stop us from developing a good and strong friendship. He was funny, kind, loving, caring, honest and cheerful. He would always do small things to make me happy, and protect me from people who were talking badly about me (I was still learning the language, so I didn’t know if someone was badmouthing.). He started giving me flowers, small gifts and telling me he loves me. I did not believe it from the start. I thought it is just infatuation with something new (they don’t have many foreigners here). But for two years, he relentlessly courted me, chased after me and every day he would show me that he loves me. I started trusting him, and eventually fell in love. For the first time in my life (I'm 29, laugh all you want), I fell in love. I fell deeply and truthfully with a guy who is in his early twenties. In June 2019 I told him I love him. For the first time since he started courting me, I told him I love him. He was so happy. Previously he was staying at my place often, to watch movies until late at night and he would sleep over. After I told him I love him, he started staying over and sleeping in the same bed as me. I couldn’t give him a sexual relationship at the time, because he was going to be my first. And God, I am so happy that I did not make this mistake. The world was such a nice place after we shared our feelings. I grew even more attached to him. I would go to meet him at work, cook for him, and do his laundry, as he left his things in my house. 
I went home for while in August, as every year I have only about half a month of rest when I can go home. I came back and he picked me up from the station. We celebrated my birthday together. Everyone knew we are together and they were happy for us. Everyone in his circle of friends and mine knew, that he loved me for two years and chased after me. They were happy. But this is when things started going down. And me, being blindly in love, didn’t want to see it. After my birthday (beginning of September) he started staying with me less and less. He said his work is very busy and hectic, and I believed it, as he is a wedding photographer. He started talking less to me, and staying the night less often. From months where he was with me every night, to only a few nights for an entire month. I was lonely, but did not want to hinder his work. I knew he is trying hard to get better at it. I did not say anything. I was supporting him and swallowing my desire to be together. In October he went to a different city to go through a photography seminar. He came back with a hickey on his neck. I was hurt and asked if there is another woman, if we should go back to being friends. He said there is nothing like this, he was at a course, who could have done it, he did not know anyone there. I had my doubts, but decided to trust him and did not say anything anymore. Later that month he said he wants us to get married. I was so happy. Warned him that there might be opposition from our families, as I am older than him, but also told him that I am ready to fight for our right to be together. What a fool I was. In November he asked me to go to another city for a two days-one night trip with him and his friends. Once more my heart soared to the sky. I went with him. He was talking with his mom on a messaging app and send her a photo of his friends on the other end of the dining table, I told him we should send her a photo of the two of us together too, but he declined. If only I knew that “Mother”, was not actually who I thought. I got hurt again, but did not say anything, maybe his parents did not approve of us yet? We went back to our city of residence and things went on as the past few months, less time meeting, less communication. One night when he was in my bed, he got a call from a woman. He told me his friend had drank a lot and he needs to help her get home. I cried myself to sleep that night. I was so hurt and humiliated.
 I was trying to make it work, believe me. I would ask him if wants me to bring dinner to him at his office, as he was always working late, but he would always decline for some reason. One time I went without asking, thought I will surprise him. Gave him a call when I was outside the building, as he needs to come and open the door for me. I had to wait for some time before he came. As soon as I saw him, I saw a new hickey on his neck. I did not say anything until we went inside. There were two cups on the table, one with lipstick on it. I asked him one more time if he needs to tell me something. He pretended not to understand until I pointed to his neck. He said he didn’t know where it came from. I pointed to the cup with lipstick. He said it was left behind by a client. That is when I lost my composure, and as shameful as it is I cried and asked him to tell me the truth. Is there another woman. He declined with so much passion, that me, being the fool again, believed him. In December he had to go to the city where he took that photography course before, there was something wrong with his grandmother, or at least that is what he said. He kept sending me messages, telling me he misses me and loves me. Calling and saying he can’t wait to come back and see me. On the second of January he called me again. His voice was cold and told me that he does not love me, does not want to be with me, and wants me to disappear from his life. He hung up. I called back, frantically wondering what did I do wrong? I’m the type that is faithful, If I say I love you, it means I really do and I will never cheat on you. And regardless of the situation I would never lie to you. That’s just how I was raised. When he picked up the phone there was a woman with him. I knew her voice, because I heard her calling him in the middle of the night before. She was the ""drunk friend"" . She said I need to stop harassing him. I swallowed my pride and instead of speaking to him, decided to question her. And the answers she gave me devastated me. They have been together since September 2019. Just three months after I told him I love him and we started dating officially. She did not know about me, he told her I am harassing him. I asked her to put the call on speaker. I told her. Everything that went on for September, October and November, up to the moment he left. Everything I said, she asked if it is true, and he said it is true. When I said he asked me to marry him in October she could not believe it. But once more he said it is the truth. I ended the conversation, after he said that he was just playing me, because it was fun to toy with my heart. 
Now, I’m sitting in bed, unable to sleep properly or eat anything. Asking myself, what did I do wrong? What did I do to deserve this? Is it my fault? I’m also scared. How can I trust anyone after this... Two years of courting, two years of constant show of love and appreciation. Half a year of dating. And most of the half year of dating was a lie. A game. I know all I brought to our relationship was a heart, honesty, and love. But was that not enough? I never wanted from him material things or money. All I wanted was to be with him, be together, fall asleep together, wake up together, share our day and troubles, share meals, make plans for a house and children. 
Dear reader, I know I am not the first person in this world that has a broken heart. I know I am not the first one that was played. But if you reached this point of my story, can you tell me - was it my fault? Did I do something wrong? Was it because I did not sleep with him? Was I too late in saying that I love him too? And can you please tell me, how am I supposed to trust again?"|Phantomhivez|False|https://redd.it/ektfb6|3|0.81|0|4|1|relationship_advice

Last year while I was 30 weeks and 6 days pregnant he punched me in the face for calling him a ""Fuck face"" because I almost got hit in the stomach by our(at the time) 1 year old because he almost knocked him into me I asked him to please be careful 3 times. He got annoyed with that so he put his arm on my face and I kept moving it well after asking him to stop multiple times I pushed his pressure point in his arm because I'm not as strong as him to stop something like that and he decided to bite me over it like he was a 2 year old so i smacked him for it and he just started punching me over it. I can't get over it and I don't know why he has called me every name in the book, but I love him so I haven't left him some days I want to and somedays I don't. My question is if you are tired of someone you love deeply calling you names, putting you down, and hurting you how do you leave? I don't have anyone I can stay with family around me the closes one are a few states away and I don't have a license or car. I Want to be able to have my kids father in their life, but at the same time i want to run away from it all. I know its my fault I got hit, but any advice would be helpful."|SatansBookofSecrets|False|https://redd.it/eksgcb|5|0.7|0|14|1|relationship_advice
ekxt0z|2020-01-06 18:11:14|Sexual abuse. Any tips for the partner of a survivor?|"We are both 32m/f. Been together 10yrs. When my wife was barely a teen she was sexually assaulted. 

She’s done the therapy sessions. No help. Multiple therapists. Not helpful to her. I say this because therapy seems to be championed non-stop in this sub. Yes it’s always good advice. But more importantly it is not the fix-all solution some people sell it as. Not for her. 

My question is really general and basic so forgive me. What do I do? 

She’s had episodes here and there. We managed them good IMO. I am supportive. I try to play off her if that makes sense in these times. I’m really receptive to anything she says in these times. I go above and beyond. 

It flares up for her randomly. She can’t identify triggers or anything like that. I feel fucking helpless. I would fight to the death for this woman and have her back in any situation. But it’s like I can do nothing here. Nothing. It’s like starting at defeated. 

So there’s always this extra thing just hanging around the edges of our sex life. I get all fucking weird too. I start to get insecure like is it my body? Did I say something thoughtless? Am I just as terrible as the pos asshole who assaulted her as a child because I’m pursuing a sexual relationship with my wife? Wtf 

Hoping to hear from any survivors who may be willing to share perspective. Any partners of survivors who’ve found ways of navigating the mess of some other scumbag before you. Thanks."|BillionDollarDaddy|False|https://redd.it/ekxt0z|0|0.5|0|12|1|relationship_advice
ekxsw3|2020-01-06 18:10:59|Photographer|I’m 100% aware of the answers people will give me. I know the best solution is to break up, but I don’t want the relationship to end because of this. My boyfriend photographs nude women as a hobby, not a job. I still see it as part of his work, however. I don’t want to tell him what he can and can’t do, because I view that as toxic, and I’m not going to stoop that low. So, I know my only option left is to leave. I don’t want to leave, more so I’m afraid to leave. I look at him and I’m willing to suffer through this if that’s what makes him happy, but it gets extremely hard at times. I try not to show him how I feel, because I don’t want him to feel as if he has to stop what he loves in order to keep this going. So I swallow everything and pretend I’m okay for his sake and his happiness. But I can feel my self slowly going nuts because of it and now I’m second guessing everything. I can’t do this anymore and part of me wants to get up and leave, and the other side wants to stay and endure this whole thing.|AndromedaVII|False|https://redd.it/ekxsw3|0|0.5|0|11|1|relationship_advice
ekxs7j|2020-01-06 18:09:35|Need advice about a weird anxiety re people I care about|"I am nervous to post this because no one I know ever talks about it so it seems to me an uncommon problem to have and I dont want people to think I'm weird. I have brought this up with someone in the past and their reaction was negative and they didnt seem to understand me. It is very personal.
I dont actually understand it myself so perhaps I wont make any sense when I explain it but I will do my best.

I get anxiety like most people do, but centred around the people I love very much. For example when my mother does something really kind for me, or we have a sweet moment together I get really anxious about something bad happening to her and intrusive thoughts of these things happening. It seems only to happen regarding people I love very much.

Or quite often in a new relationship, like the one I am in now where the person is very kind and sweet to me I get incredibly anxious about things going wrong, and about what they think. I dont think I show it, but I worry. The other day he made me dinner to take to work and I forgot to take it. I didnt realise until later in the day and it really upset me. I just felt...guilty? I guess...for forgetting it. I got so emotional about it but there is no good reason as to why I should feel that way. My feelings of guilt were more than what someone may feel if they had forgotten on purpose.

Once I made plans with my dad, and accidentally got them mixed up with other plans I had to attend so I needed to cancel. I felt so terrible and guilty thinking of him having to go alone and it was tearing me apart and I couldnt relax until I got a message back to say it was fine, and even then it only helped a little. I worry, irrationally, about small mistakes like this damaging my relationship with that person, even though I know that wont happen.

I am not a pain to be around, I have never brought something like this up with the person concerned because I dont know how to explain it, they cant help me and it would stress them out for no reason. I deal with these weird feelings completely in private and i want to keep it that way. I just want to calm the f%@k down.

I should add that this isnt a concern all the time and every day. It is usually during new relationships or periods of time where I feel emotionally vulnerable for whatever reason.

Is there a name for what I am feeling? Any advice would be appreciated."|trufflekitten7|False|https://redd.it/ekxs7j|1|1.0|0|3|1|relationship_advice
ekxrs1|2020-01-06 18:08:52|I [M19] burnt out from school and extra-curricular and it hurt my now ex-GF [F20]. How do I fix this?|"Backstory:
We are both second year college students in the Midwest who met on Tinder. We met in early December 2018 (Our first semester) and hit it off right away, first date I fell asleep in her room after listening to music and talking all night. Met her family a few weeks later for New Years and within the month I told her I loved her. This was odd for me that it just popped out because I come from a family where I can count on my fingers the number of times “I love you” has ever been said, so I’m not sure why but I really struggle to get it out sometimes without feelings weird/awkward. Coming back for Spring semester was phenomenal, we would always do stuff together like homework, going to the dining centers, or just taking naps in her room. We did fight about how she wanted to go out with her friends to play intramurals when her courses seemed to be falling by the wayside, Admittedly I should have let her do what was best for her but I let my jealously get in the way since it was all guys and her on the team meeting late at night then going out for an hour or so after. Then summer hit and I went back to my home a state away and got a very intense job where I was up at 3am and was drained once I got off work at 3pm. We still talked normally and FaceTimed often but I couldn’t make it work all the time to meet up in person. IIRC we did meet in person 3-4 times throughout the entire summer for a week-ish at a time. Then going into Fall semester for our second year I was taking 18 credits, held an executive position in my fraternity and was being pushed into being president at the same time, so I had a lot on my plate. Also this might seem obvious what was going on with me but I am very slow when it comes to stuff dealing with emotions so I didn’t know what being burnt out felt like or picking up on the hints she dropped. 

Leading up to the break up;
I want to say I started noticing that something was off when I went over to her place one night early November and I just wasn’t have a good time when normally she would bring a smile to my face on sight. As I was leaving she asked me what was going on and I just told her “I don’t think I feel it anymore” because I figured I’d rather be honest than try to cover up my feelings. She was very torn up about that and we talked about it some more but i couldn’t for the life of me understand why I felt the way I did. Eventually my feelings for her came back like normal and we were fine again until it started to happen once more and she started telling me that she wasn’t feeling great about herself anymore and asked me if I could do something to help her out so I said I would, I never attributed that to how I stopped giving compliments or say that I loved her. Then our one year anniversary came up and I completely dropped the ball, I didn’t do anything special, I hardly made the time to hang out because I got really busy with school work since finals week was fast approaching. She told me that she was disappointed that we didn’t do anything special and I said I was sorry and I would try to make it up to her by being better. Our texting conversations got really dry as well, I was replying with one word answers or just getting annoyed quickly when she didn’t understand what I was saying and looking back at it I feel like such an ass and stupid for missing how all the pressure was make me act to her.

Break up:
She texted me late one night saying we need to talk. I knew exactly what was going on so I just told her to do it now since I was currently finishing an essay final for one of my courses and she would need time to type it all out so I could finish and then talk. She said that she felt more appreciated by her intramural team than by her own boyfriend and that I had lost her trust by telling her I would try to be better when I didn’t really make an effort to. This was when I snapped out of whatever funk I was in and realized that I was a massive piece of garbage who really just needed a wake up call to see that while I was doing well in every other aspect of my life I really let her take the bullet. I brought over all the stuff of her that I kept at my place and she gave me all of my stuff she didn’t want and she said I was still really important in her life and she just wanted to stay friends. The next day I was still regretting the whole situation so I went out and got her some chocolate, snacks, flowers, and a note to try and prove that I do still have it in me. She accepted the gift but still just wanted to remain friends. Later that week I went over again with an apology for everything that had happened and how I really wanted to make it up to her by being there for her now. We ended up going back to my place to watch a movie as friends would then I drove her home and that was the last time I saw her before break started.

Now:
It’s a month later and she hasn’t left my mind now matter how hard I try although I am giving her space so I don’t text her anymore. She’s the first thing I think about when I wake up, whenever I see something we used to do I think about how those were good memories then my heart drops when I realize I can’t do those with her anymore, she’s what I think about as I lie awake in bed and she’s always in my dreams. Either my dreams are me watching myself fuck up by not kissing her when she asks for it or by not telling her how I think she looks good or that I love her because it feels awkward to say, or they are my life would be now if I didn’t have her and someone else did. I try to write notes and talk to people to let me feelings out but eventually all the same feelings return. I really want to text her and tell her that I want her back in my life again preferably dating again working back to what we had but I would accept being friends for now. 

So basically I ask:
How do I fix this? Has anybody been in a similar situation where nearly all of the fault is on you and you successfully got her back in your life?

Edit: Since I’m giving her space now do I wait for her to move on after a few weeks or do I try to reach out when I get back to campus?"|pecus_|False|https://redd.it/ekxrs1|1|0.67|0|8|1|relationship_advice
ekxrpq|2020-01-06 18:08:45|Was I wrong to break up with her?|"My girlfriend (22F) and I(23M) got into it last night right as we laid down to go to bed. She said a cool “goodnight” without a kiss, touch of hand or I love you. From there on out everything went to hell.

So we had been together about a year and 2 months, on and off. Mostly on though and for the most part, we worked well together. We had our issues in and out of the bedroom but each time we got back together we became much stronger. It previously had been her separating with me mostly because of something dumb I did or said and I worked hard ever time to overcome those idiotic actions. As far as in the bedroom, prior to meeting this girl I was in an emotionally abusive relationship where my ex used sex to manipulate me. That lasted almost 2 years before I finally grew a pair to get out of it. 

This left me very scared sexually and insecure and unfortunately that carried over initially into my new relationship, I realized months ago I should have waited to heal before entering a new relationship but this girl is really special. It was one of those locked eyes and had an instant connection type of partnership. I slowly overcame the emotional damage and our sex life was amazing for the better part of the year. Like seriously the best we’ve ever experienced, and I know that she wasn’t just making that up. However, one night about a month ago we were about to have sex and I started getting this insane anxiety out of nowhere. We had been drinking and I did not feel right but I wanted to push through for her. It did not end well.

The whole incident left me too much in my own head and each time we tried (3-4 times) it didn’t work out. The last time I really screwed up and said “I’m nervous” at which point I visibly saw the ick enter her mindset. Let me tell you, that is the worst face any guy could see his woman make. After that we got into a couple minor arguments and worked things out quickly, but I have been able to tell for the past months she is completely turned off physically to me. No exaggeration here, she would not attempt to kiss, would pull away anytime I even touched her going for a hug or to hold her hand. Then she would ignore me. This is not how our relationship had been for the majority of the time, normally she is very happy and touchy with me. I told her nicely 5 different times over the past month that I need that affection. I needed, not just wanted, for her show her interest. She repeatedly didn’t each time I tried to instigate any kind of physical contact. Again, not even sexually. Just showing her my affection.

The bottom line here is folks, I love this girl. She is a really good woman and one of the most kind and self driven person I’ve ever met. Regardless of what you think of me from this post, I am self driven and motivated to help others too, we both have careers in it. We work well together in our relationship even though we don’t see eye to eye all the time. But nobody does right? People grow and change together and we have pushed each other in a better direction. We are both much different than the people we used to be and I don’t see why this would halt. But that damn ick.

Last night had been weird, she was usually distant. I know she was extremely tired after a very stressful day so I gave her space and let her just relax on the couch. We honestly probably said 10 words to each other the entire time I was at her place, probably 6 hours. The vibe was just even more off because of her long day, but after she said “goodnight”, I just asked her a simple question. “Do you still want this?” Thinking that it would be easy for her to say yes and remember that I had asked her to be a little more affectionate several times. Well isn’t it great that she replied even more coldly after a long pause, “I don’t know”

So we talk for a minute, she explains that she just doesn’t know and that it’s not a hard no or yes. She is tired of having a rough patch and I tell her we have had rough patches and gotten through them better each time. I repeat the question, same response. I get up, go cool off in the bathroom because I’m pretty heated, I didn’t expect that question to go this way. I walk back in, ask it a third time and tell her to really think, because in my head this is an easy answer. I want her. Undoubtedly. She pauses... same response. I began to pack my stuff up. She continues to ramble about the not sure stuff and I’m tired of it. It shouldn’t be that difficult for her right? It’s a yes or no and she continues with the idk stuff. Well I tell her that’s as good as a no and all I needed was a yes for everything to be good. So I walk out the door. She was quick to get out of bed and lock the door behind me.

I called her on the way home and told her that this is it. It’s not a hard question and that I truly loved her. I didn’t want things to end but if she couldn’t follow through with her promises to be more affectionate that we were done. She continued to say she didn’t know, so I hung up. We haven’t talked since and I don’t plan on it. It’s so confusing because I love her but I can’t be in a stale relationship like that? I know for a fact things would get better on my end, I always try to push myself to be the man my woman needs but she doesn’t do that for me anymore. 
I feel torn up because I don’t want this to end, was it wrong of me to push that after repeated (and separate) conversations of my needs? I do not want to be with someone who has the ick for me, even if she loves me. I hate the idea of her being with anybody else and that I might of hurt her. That being said I’m not afraid to move on given the rocky nature of our relationship.

His mom took it very hard as they were really close and I feel like she was closed off towards me from the very beginning. 

Apparently after my first time meeting her, she asked my boyfriend if “I had a personality” because I’m naturally shy and kept to myself when meeting new people. I took offense to it and every since her comment, I have felt pretty intimidated and uncomfortable to make conversation with her. 

I ended up moving in with his family after my dad moved out of state in the summer.
I’ve spent my first Christmas with them as well as Thanksgiving.
Things were great around Thanksgiving and we talked more than we ever have, went black Friday shopping together, etc. Around Christmas, it was back to awkwardness. I felt like we still haven’t connected or genuinely bonded at that point.

Fast forward to last night, her and my boyfriend ended up talking for hours, and basically what came from this conversation is that he is concerned about my relationship with his mom because he wants us to get along. I told him I’ve tried and that is something I want for anyone that I’m with because family is important to me. I told him that I don’t think I’m someone she wants to be brought home (she is very religious, and I am a Christian as well but was not brought up on it. Anyone who has been there knows that it can be hard discovering that for yourself.) My parents are not local or even together, and the last year has been hard with them separating, moving away, me moving in on my own.

I feel very judged and tolerated by her because I make her son happy. She has not truly given me a chance, all of her friends and family love me, and has seen what kind of person I am.

ekk52x|2020-01-05 22:31:28|My (28M) wife (24F) wife has been self harming|"A week ago, I noticed a strange feeling on my wife's feet when we were snuggling in bed. I asked her what it was, and she initially said nothing.

I didn't think much of it, but she immediately became very withdrawn. I asked her what the issue was, and she started crying. She told me she had been self harming, and she'd been hurting her feet. 

I looked at it, and sure enough, she had been peeling the skin away on the bottom of her feet. There were some fresh peels which were very red, almost bleeding, and some older healed scars.

I gave them a dab with alcohol rub and kissed her, and told her I love her. I listened to her and didn't make it feel guilty, even though she kept saying she was sorry. I just said it'll be okay, and that I'll always love her.

The thing is, we can't afford therapy. She talked to her GP, and she's on the list for therapy, but it could take months. We just can't afford therapy... I've thought about everything. We can't get rid of the car. We don't have a T.V. we don't have any way to boost our finances ATM.

I (31F) am in a long distance relationship with someone in another state (31M) who I have known for 14 years. We have been together for about 8 months and (admittedly chronically but more intensely lately) I have been struggling with insecurity and with difficulty with trust. Not for anything that he has done, just overthinking and knowing too much about this past. My own insecurity is getting in the way and causing me a lot of my own challenges, and causing me to push him away.

The problem is that she is a lot more invested in this than I can be and simply won’t allow me to break the relationship apart. 

I tell her that I don’t hate her and I don’t want to stop communicating but I juts simply don’t want the romance anymore. 

She says that from here if I do this it will make her life a lot harder and will make her super sad. While I understand that this is the case I wanted to explain to her that it is my time to go. 

We split once before and it was really bad for her. I came back in October and we hooked up from here I understood that we vibe well together still but I felt some regret in the end. 

Now after hooking up occasionally she won’t allow me to step away from the relationship and it feels like the only way I can make progress is lying or making promises I know I can’t keep. 

This feels terrible and the absolute worst way to handle it but at the moment I had to. 

At this point we have a agreed to a “break” which I’m not happy with and I’m worried that once this break is over I’ll have to do the same thing. 

If you have made it this far I’m looking for advice on how I can come back after this break and either try to work it out or cut it off.

My partner and I have been together for a considerable amount of time, friends beforehand. We both have kids of our own, from different relationships, none together. 

He told me before we got together that even though he might not want kids, he would never rule it out for the next person he enters a relationship with. I turned out to be the next person he entered a relationship with, and I’ve always wanted at least one more child. 

Today he text me telling me we needed to talk and it sent my anxiety clean through the roof and I pestered him to tell me what was wrong and he told me that he didn’t want any more kids and he didn’t want to keep stringing me along because he knows I want more. It was very difficult to process. 

We spoke about it before and I said I didn’t want to be in a place next year where he didn’t know what he wanted and I admitted I did want more kids and it would hurt if he didn’t, which he brought up. 

But the thing is, I feel like he’s not giving me the ability to work through the thought of not having anymore children. My love for him outweighs the imaginary kids that won’t happen and I just want him to understand it. A relationship has never felt more right for me before in my life, and I can’t imagine living my life without him in it. I told him I’m willing to work through it and I feel like he’s not going to give me that chance. He’s coming to my house tomorrow to talk all of this through. 

I’m not asking for “how do I keep my mans from leaving me” advice, I’m asking for advice on how to process the situation and how to speak to him tomorrow about this.

ekunbr|2020-01-06 14:13:14|Friend (early 30's F) constantly dating abusive guys. How can anyone make her stop?|"I've known this girl for about half my life. She was an ex of a good friend. 

The girl in question has always bounced around states and with men. She's dated some girls and all but one sucked. But they've been far less abusive than the men.

She even married one. This dude cheated on her constantly and plotted her death with one of the girls he cheated on her with. She married him after less than six months of knowing him. She went back and forth with him for a couple of years until they finally divorced.

She went back and forth with a guy right after who ended up *beating her.* Police were called, he was arrested. He also cheated on her, etc etc. According to what I could put together, she chose him over her family and ended up homeless. Shortly after this ordeal, she went back to him and is now engaged, showing it off on social media. She seems very very proud.

These two guys have been the worst I've seen. The other have cheated and she typically went back and forth with all of them several times, sometimes for years. She always posts these sad posts about men and how terrible her life is. She'll post tons of quotes too. Then she'll post these gushy and happy photos of her with said guy. 

It's so systematic at this point....

- Find guy

- see he's bad and post about it on social media

- break up and get back together, detailing it all

- finally break up for good and start the same pattern with another guy

It's almost like she's gloating? I know a lot of it is for attention. As someone who's dated horrible abusive guys for years, I really feel for her. I try to talk her out of getting back with the same guy and so do others. She obviously doesn't listen. Her other friends will even offer her places to stay. 

For years I thought it was just battered wife syndrome and she needed therapy. She still does but after seeing how exact her pattern is, I'm starting to think this is something else. I'm starting to believe she enjoys the excitement, attention and drama. And I hate that I think that because in no way does she deserve the abuse she gets. But the way she details all of this on social media, ignores anyone trying to get her out of bad situations and how calculating this is makes me think she knows *exactly* what she's doing.

She use to get really defensive whenever I'd ask questions. Now she ignores them.

It's a shame because she's really smart and has all of this potential but she's just wasting it away.

Met on a dating site and have been seeing each other almost every week since then; going on dates, stayed over at each others houses pretty regularly, and we even talk about doing things months down the line. We've never talked about specific labels or anything like that, but I assumed we were just together because he's acted that way.

But earlier today while I was at his, I spotted he had tinder on his phone. Not gonna lie, the curiosity got the better at me and I looked while he was away from his phone, and saw that he had messaged a handful of people as recent as two weeks ago. The conversations all fizzled out, but its just put a whole spin on what I thought was a relationship.

ekumzp|2020-01-06 14:12:32|My (30f) partner (30m) refuses to work, says he's too stupid|"As title really. We have been together 10+ years, we got together when my daughter was a few months old. He has no income, has had no income for many years, I take care of all expenses.

Background on me:
I have mental health problems on and off (anxiety depression and PMDD). I have worked several part time jobs, I have been back to college and got a degree (I had dropped out when pregnant age 19) and have been self employed throughout all this too. I have worked in sex work when I have felt up to it, I'm a recovering gambling addict also (started when I got pregnant, took years to sort myself out). I really have had to work hard, and hate myself for my mistakes, but still do anything to keep food on the table and get through life. I don't have nice things, I rent my house, I don't drive, there are no expenses left to cut from my budget, I live frugal as hell. So what I'm saying is the stupid gambling didn't bring in any money, there are no secret savings, I have pennies in my bank accounts most of the time. Sex work doesn't bring in consistent money, and my ability to work due to mental health issues is inconsistent too. I'm in debt, mainly house expenses and unpaid bills. 

Background on him:  He had short term jobs in security, less than a year of employment earlier in our relationship. He has lots of expensive things in my house that he's saved up to buy from when he lived at home or birthday money etc. He doesn't have any qualifications, or any work experience or references for the past almost decade. He enrolled on a part time college course after my begging last August, but he wails on and on about it being too hard and pointless and he's too stupid, I have to help him with his work, or listen to him get angry about how the course is run, how the college is rubbish and the tutors are all useless.


Recently things have absolutely sucked. I've been back at the Dr and was given antidepressants again, Dr asked if my partner is supportive and I just broke down crying. I couldn't answer in a straight way, because he ISN'T. He knows how much stress I am in, how hard it is to keep money coming in, but he refuses, flat out refuses to look for work. I have tried reasoning to him saying ""but I did sex work! There must be something, anything you can do?!"". He gets angry, he sulks, he gets in my face telling me how I have a degree and work experience it's so much easier for me but how he's such a stupid loser he can't do anything.

The thing is how do I know that's true, because I haven't seen him trying. I just hear complaints. I had a full PMDD breakdown two days before Xmas and I just spent a straight 12 hours crying, I couldn't face my daughter, I couldn't breathe, I just cried and cried and then got angry I was in such a state and again begged him to look for work or some income to take the pressure off me. As my bank balance trickles down I know it's inevitable I will have to go back on cam (cam girl) and do more shows. I actually LOVE being a camgirl when I'm well, I really do, but as I'm less and less well it seems like a prison. I'm looking for a full time job doing literally anything but he is right on one thing, it is very hard to find work where we live, even when you're really trying.

I have a dream for him that he will be finally happy and satisfied and able to stop putting himself down and be something in the world that he can be proud of, I know he has dreams for himself but always says he can't afford it, I say you gotta try and earn it, and then the sulks and excuses and shouting starts. If I had the nearly two grand he wants to change his life (get his full personal training qualifications) I would give it to him in a heartbeat, and he says he's the stupid one. 

So Reddit please tell me, whilst remembering that I understand he is the anchor dragging me down, what can I do (if anything) to help him to help me? I really hate seeing him depressed and lost and dejected, and I get the irony that I'm here trying to help him yet again, he doesn't seem to see me and feel sad or guilty enough to look for help."|Followed_By_Crows|False|https://redd.it/ekumzp|2|0.75|0|26|1|relationship_advice

ekxm74|2020-01-06 17:57:46|The girl im talking to right now is probably an avoider, what to do? She's my prom partner.|"We've been texting for a month now, since the first week I started suggesting that we should go out somewhere together, but she always avoids the question.



Anyways I organized a New Years Eve party and she came beautifly dressed and her hair... (obviously put a lot effort into her appearance) and 95% of the time just talked to me throughout the entire party and stayed up till 5am (she normally leaves parties at about 11pm).






 Today I said that maybe we should go for a walk, since she was already going out to church today, but she didn't want to, avoided it. Since 20 days ago I started to slow down with the invites, limiting myself to only asking her once a week to go out somewhere. Maybe I am going to hard on her. 



But seriously in DMs she stays up till 4am chatting with me about more and more personal and intimate stuff, always writes goodnight with a kiss emote, at school we hold a lot of eye contact and it's not uncomfortable, and in real life we talk a lot, she started physically teasing me as well, during the New Years Eve party we touched a lot, just a lot of physical contact but no kissing. And btw I asked her out to prom a month ago, she said yes, she shows up to dance practices but never wants to hang out with me before them (she lives far away, and so after school she spends time with her sister at school until the dance practices). I asked her yesterday if she is infatuated, she said she couldn't answer, but she asked me and told me to answer the question, and I said yes I am! She told me she can't answer because a month is not that long for her.






My friends are telling me to be more patient, but seriously will this ever change? Or will she be avoiding me throughout our relationship if it ever happens?





Also worth adding is that her parents split up when she was young, and her mother is kind of treating her badly for the last few years, not abuse abuse but just really hostile behaviour (nothing physical) but she does very rarely cry she told me, so maybe that has to do with her being avoidant? About a week ago she told me she went out of the house for 3 hours to just walk around alone, I told her that if she ever wants me to cheer her up and meet up than she can call me, she said that she always wanted to have a person like that <3, a guy who would make her feel better.

ekircg|2020-01-05 20:40:55|I’m (40f) in an uphill battle trying to accept and help plan my BF (37m) plan and prepare for his rebound baby.|"I broke things off with my long term bf several months ago due to some issues that mostly could have been solved with a little more communication. While he was doing some things that were inappropriate, I jumped the gun and made wrong assumptions. I ended things and wouldn’t have if I’d had all the facts. I cut off all contact with him for a few months.

During this time he started seeing a woman casually and sleeping with her. Once or twice a week for about 6 weeks. No dates or overnights, just Netflix and chill type of thing. When I had finally answered his messages, he asked me to see his therapist with him and I agreed. He told the woman that he wouldn’t be spending time with her anymore as he was working on getting back with me, I was the love of his life etc.. He said she never showed an issue with this.

Shortly after he and I started therapy, she says she’s pregnant. She tells him to tell me because I should know. He tells her I will probably end things with him so he’d rather wait until he gets confirmation but she insists. He tells me. I’m devastated but want to make sure she’s not lying. Ultrasound confirms pregnancy. Dates match up. Pretty confident the baby is his.

He said she was calm at the appointment and he again relays to her that he is with me but will continue to be there for the baby etc. She apologized for saying she was infertile etc and agrees to have a group dynamic in the best interest of the baby. 

My bf was checking in on her and she asks what he’s been up to etc, He tells her working and all that and spending time with me. She instantly flipped on him and asked him to sign over his rights so she can “block him from her life” she said she can’t trust him and doesn’t want to fight him etc etc. she said she doesn’t want anything to do with him until the DNA test and they can see each other in court.. 

I’m already struggling with this woman being a part of our lives considering the pain coming from the break up. I’m struggling with how to accept the child but willing to give it my best because I love him. Now she is flipping out and showing that she clearly is interested in just having him and that my presence is going to be a constant battle for him to have access to his child.. I was just hoping to have an adult relationship with her. I don’t think this is going to be possible. She’s pissed that he isn’t with her more often. He’s been to the appointments and checks on her every few days because she’s been so sick. I guess she wants the special foods delivered, visits or massages etc. but that’s not appropriate in my opinion. That’s relationship type of attention. She wants help paying her bills because she can’t work due to her nausea and vomiting. 

I’m trying really hard not to inject myself in this but I’m watching her treat my bf like total shit and trying to intimidate him. She’s threatening him with access to the child and she’s not even in the second trimester."|karebearkilla79|False|https://redd.it/ekircg|49|0.82|0|94|1|relationship_advice

Id like to ask you for your opinion. I have a girl friend. We know each other many years, went through a lot together, helped each other when needed... Recently I had to face feeling that I like her more than a friend, got emotionally engaged with her what I initially refused to believe. The thing is that I said her whats going on cause she kinda felt lately that Im behaving strangely. Well she said shes disappointed with me and ask me to not engage together for some time to settle things down. I believe this friendship is over at least it wont be as it used to be in the past, nonetheless its the only way how not to hurt any of us. 

I can manage that, its life but recently my friend began to invite his friends for birthday party weekend and as you probably expect he invited both of us. I cant refuse my buddy to come over to his birthday party just because of my emotional entanglement with Suzan. It would look pretty stupid and childish, still I have strange feeling that it might be weird to see her there for two days. Im not sure how the situation might unfold and I definitely dont want to create strange atmosphere there.

ekxk8r|2020-01-06 17:53:50|Should I go for it ?|"I met this girl who is in a different college , 10mins from mine . 
She's great and everything , we really hit it off .  

Way before I met her I got broken out of relationships twice . So I basically had this no strings attach kinda mentality thing . I stoped believing in love and commitments .
I took it in a different way that this is the time to make career and not get all attached with anyone and just keep relationships to a certain degree . 


So anyway ,way later , I met her through one of my old school friend who is her classmate and a pretty close friend . I really felt like a connection . Idk how to put it into words but it was something I never felt before . 
She never dated anyone , and she was completely innocent. basically a nerd types . 
But we just connected and we both knew that . 
Even though we don't know much about each other , but felt like we knew each other . 
Anyway I only met her a couple of times after that , ofcourse our mutual friend was always there . 
Way later on I got busy with college , internships.
After 5 months today my school friend invited me to some event in her college .so I went .
I met her , and we talked alot . I really just wanted to ask her out and get it all off my chest but couldn't . 

Few hours later , I told my school friend that I really like her and wanted to ask her out , so should I , or could u find out if she's into it too .

Then she suddenly started telling me all bad things about her , I wanted to believe her cause she never lied to me but I just couldn't .

She stated telling that you guys wouldnt work out .
And as she knows all about my past , she said "" you will end up breaking her heart "" 
All my past relationships were truly a burden . Im not a player or anything . With whoever I was I always kept it 💯. 
And when shit got outta control I use to honestly tell them that it's better to split up . 

And after all the dating my mind set was really fucked . And I just didn't want to commit to anyone . 

Anyway so she started telling me that don't ask her out , and don't even talk to her , she is not your type kinda stuff . And alot more .

And she really said alot of negative things about her which she never said before . I never knew that's how she felt about her .I was completely shock , how can you call her your best friend and talk complete nonsense about her.

Anyway after the event , we were exiting and I told my friend that lemme atleast say goodbye to her before leaving , and she told me that she already left . 

But after a few mins, that girl calls her and ask where we were ( in their language which I could understand a lil but my friend didn't know I could)  she said we had left.
That girl was waiting for us outside the whole time. That's when I knew she lied to me n her.

So this female told her that "" tell him it was nice meeting him, and tell him thanks for making me laugh through out the event, I enjoyed it"" 
She told me this later on.

 I know she wants me n I want her, or atleast hang out to find out then. 

It later on hit me that they are best friends n me coming in between them would or maybe spoil their thing. 

But now I'm thinking, why do I care. I never felt this before and no one is getting hurt outta it ,for now atleast.

I really can't decide what to do cause I don't want to hurt my friend.

Am I gonna be a bad person  if I ask her out even though my friend is completely against it?"|Rawwmatic24|False|https://redd.it/ekxk8r|1|1.0|0|2|1|relationship_advice

Me (M28) and my girlfriend (F29) have been going out for 5 years now. It's had its ups and downs but it's been solid. Her mother, an OCD alcoholic and painpill abuser, passed away after a trip we took to London (we heard about it at the airport). I was there for her through alot and I am her first everything (including kiss at the age of 23). I am currently finishing my masters in architecture in Ohio and have been traveling for school often due to internships (Nashville Chicago SC) she helped me get into school and has tried her best to stay with me and support me through it all. We talked while I traveled almost every day and she'd often come and visit me. Most of the problems of the relationship have been due to my insecurities and my idea of the perfect woman. Although she has an amazing personality and everyone loves her including my parents, her students and my friends, she does not appeal to me sexually. A lifetime of not knowing how to take care of herself has taken a toll on her body and it's hard for me to deal with. I am an ex-collegiate athlete, workout every day and have an active lifestyle so there is a big contrast there but we still get along very well. But I also know the type of woman I physically want and she isn't really there. I hope that does not sound shallow. I also have an issue with her family. My immediate family is very close. My siblings and I are well provided for and my parents are caring loving and are my best friends. On her end, her father has never reached out to me on any occaision since we've started dating and I cannot find respect her ultra left wing sister who left her in a broken home. Although she loves me and is always there to support me I feel that she has been a physical and emotional project from the start that I have taken upon myself to fix. During times of change I usually cut ties with people including friends, loved ones etc but she has stuck around. Unsure about our relationship, on many occasions, I have pushed her away to be with other women only to come back, probably because she's there and easy for me to access and talk to. However, now that I am about to graduate and will finally be working on my own in a new city to start a new life I'm sure she expects me to take her with me. I don't want to think about it and haven't thought that far ahead. Is it ok to be selfish here and trek out alone? I do not know if I want the responsibility that decision would come with or if I am ready to marry her. It might be inevitable but I just don't want to hurt her because she has become one of my best friends. However not being sure of things has made me regret many things in my life as well. Now knowing my predicament I was wondering if anyone else was in the same situation and how they personally dealt with it. If they believed the decision they made was right or wrong?

It started off with him not wanting to label things/take it slow sexually because of being previously and kind of recently cheated on but that he liked me. Then a month after that he asked me to be his gf. But the initial wanting to take it slow really brought up the past. I’ve dated guys who didn’t actually want to be with me and I’ve had 2 narcissistic, abusive exes (one in particular was much worse and hurt me really bad).

He is genuine, funny, creative, handsome, super compatible with me, and everything I could have ever asked for. We are even in a satirical band and make comedy videos together. But the last time that I had these feelings with narcissist I got badly badly hurt. So I am scared. My bf and I see each other often and he always tells me that he likes me but I am trying to detach a bit for my own health because I’ve become fixated on him and jealous and extremely insecure and dependent. But I have hid these feelings for the most part and pretend that none of it is going on to him (tho my friends never hear the end of it). 

Should I break up and risk losing something that is genuinely special? Or try to work thru it with a therapist? I have a sneaking suspicion that these feelings will just come up in the next relationship.... where I may not be as happy otherwise

Warning: NSFW..Please do not continue reading if you're grossed out by farting and/or the sexual nature of this post

My new (4 wks) girlfriend (30F) and I (30M) hit it off a couple weeks back (Mid-Atlantic Metropolitan Area).  She's incredible.  This relationship felt/feels like love at first sight. It sounds corny, but I'm so so into this girl (mentally/psychically/spiritually/socially).  One of the great things about her is that has a veracious appetite for sex.  We had sex twice on the first date, and we giggled through the whole second time.  It felt awesome to be so carefree and in-tune with her.  After two weeks of great sex, I was feeling particularly open and vulnerable with her and I suggested she try to stimulate my butt-hole. I hadn't ever shared with a partner (or anyone) that I would be willing to try this.  She was down.  When I told her that I'm a bit of a hairy guy and requested she help shave down there, she was also down (shes a medical professional, so I know shes not as sensitive to what some people would find gross or unattractive).  The problem is that since she's saved my butt, every time I pass gas, the hairless-fart sensation reminds me of her.  My sex drive for her has decreased significantly and I'm worried it wont come back.  Though to be honest, we were having way more sex than I'd previously had in my life or thought I could physically do. 

Has this every happened to you? How were you able to re-associate the unflattering thought with something other than your partner?

TL:DR  My girlfriend shaved my butt for sexy fun reasons but now I think of her every time I pass gas.  Please help share how you got over a similar experience.

I (f47) and my partner (m48) have been together 27 years and I think we will be together for ever. I find it had to keep our story short and to the point, here goes. I know he loves me and always has, he just doesn't really know how to show it partly cause of his ASD I guess. 
We have had an OK sex life in the past. He tries to please me but he is so clumsy and cant always get things right. So I tend to pull away. I would really like to make love to somebody not just have sex but I can never let go.
 In our day to day relationship I deal with everything the money, what we do what we don't do he does do housework but doesn't see when things need done so I have to constantly point it out. I have been forced into this position of being in charge and I don't want it. I want to be looked after sometimes I want balance. Don't get me wrong he is a good man so pure and fair but I feel like his carer.  

I have noticed a pattern where I end up being friends with other males. I have never kissed or had sex with another but I guess I have shared a level of intamacy.

However, this means I don’t get to see him at all this week so I’m fighting this jealousy.  

I’m trying to work through this using coping skills and wise mind is telling me that it’s time to reach out because rational brain knows this is good but emotionally i’m struggling. 

Is there any advice that anyone has for working through this?

How do I move on cleanly?|"Let me first apologize for the long and unorganized nature of my write-up. I’m typing on mobile. 

So I was in a relationship with this girl for 2 years and the first year and a half of it was simply amazing. She was everything I was looking for in a partner. The one person who told me she’d do anything for me and I believed because she demonstrated this on more occasions than I could recount here. 
The only problem was that I’m the indoor type of guy and she was the party all night every night type of girl. “Was” because I expressed how this could be an issue earlier on in the relationship and she assured me she was done with the excessive partying and was totally okay with being with an introvert. 

The first issue reared up after our first Christmas together when I noticed a describable change in her reaction towards me generally. I tried to talk to her on numerous occasions to find out what the problem was, and all I kept getting from her was silence and an occasional grunt of “nothing”. After about 2 months of this, she finally opened up and complained about me taking her out to just the one concert during the Christmas period. We talked this out and we agreed on what I felt was a generous consensus and things returned to normal (as normal as things can be in a relationship anyways)

Three months after this, she informs me that 2 former school mates of hers were going to be visiting from another country, and everything flipped on its head following this visit. She went out partying every single day of the week till early hours of the morning (the school mates stayed at her apartment during the duration of their visit), and I’d be none the wiser. I usually woke up to the evidence of these outings on her WhatsApp status the following morning. This was a bit odd to me, as we’d tell each other everything prior to this. 
The change in attitude extended to all aspects of our relationship as well as she started being rude to me conversationally, dismissive of my complaints and would quickly get angry at the least provocation and not respond to my calls or messages for days. I consoled my self on the knowledge that things would get back to normal when the friends left and boy was I mistaken. 

Things came to a head one night when I confronted her over the phone about her change in attitude. After a minute into the phone call, she drops the call on me, and that’s it. She wouldn’t pick up or respond to my messages. I even solicited the help of her mom in talking to her on my behalf, but she wouldn’t tolerate any mention of me from anyone whatsoever. 
I made the decision to move on about two weeks into this. About 2 and a half months of absolute silence from her, she finally reaches out to say hello. She suggested we met up and talk. I asked her during this meeting if we could get back together and she said no, giving the reason that we were too different to be together. She suggested friendship and I agreed because... well, because I’m stupid. 

4 months into this friendship thing, and I realize I still want her and the sight of her entertaining others does my head in even though I try to mask it. I realize I still very much want her back and after broaching the subject of us getting back together, I receive another resounding no.
That was this afternoon. 
I’ve tried severally to sever all ties and on, usually after she’s acted rudely or disrespectfully towards me, but I cave each time she comes back and acts nicely again. 

I realize now that I need to move on, but this girl has been the dream and it’s so difficult moving on from her. 
I need advice on how to cut things off cleanly and move on without tolerating any further niceness from her and falling for it."|marshela03|False|https://redd.it/ekxds8|1|1.0|0|7|1|relationship_advice
ekufkk|2020-01-06 13:54:30|My (21/f) boyfriend (21/m) shuts down while talking, and I don't know how to help him.|"Hi Reddit.

First time poster, and I'm not really sure how all this works, but I'll try my best. English is my second language, so pardon the spelling errors.

So, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years, and for the most part it is amazing. I love him very much, and he brightens up my days and makes me laugh. He is kind, gives me compliments and is generally very respectful. However, we come from two completely different backgrounds. My bfs family is not a close-knit family like mine. His parents have a very rocky relationship and fights a lot. Bf has three siblings, two brothers and a sister. All four of the kids have a very difficult and estranged relationship with their father. Bf's father has always been very kind to me, but I know (from being told by bf, bf's brother and mother) that he had severe anger issues whilst the kids were growing up, and has exposed the kids to a lot of horrifying situations. I come from a more close knit family, and have had a happy childhood, in my own opinion. I am used to talking about and dealing with my emotions in relatively healthy ways. My bf does not. He hates talking to me about ""deep""-stuff, emotions and how he feels about stuff. He shuts it all in, and says he is fine. Until he goes out for a drink with friends, and end up getting in to fights because he can't control his anger when he drinks. (he has never been mean or nasty to me whilst drunk, it is more directed at other men).I feel he, and our relationship, would benefit from him talking through his feelings, and perhaps taking steps to try to control his anger when he drinks. The problem is whenever I try to talk to him, he shuts completely down, and instead of responding, he just stares in front of himself for 5 minutes straight. This is very frustrating for me, because I know that he is not okay all the time, even though he tells me he is. I know this because he has admitted to me, whilst drunk, that he struggles with stuff from his childhood and has even cried on my shoulders a couple of times. I feel like the shittiest gf ever because I feel happy when he cries, because I'm relieved that he is showing emotions. I just wish he would do this in a healthy, and sober, way. Without getting into fights. Is this too much to excpect, and am I being to demanding if i expect him to be able to talk with me about his struggles? I get that it is hard to expose your inner demons and wounds, and I know that it is perhaps harder for men than women. I just don't know if I should keep pushing him to talk, or leave him alone. It hurts me to see him in pain, and not being able to help him go through it,

Sorry for a messy post, hope you got the jist of it.

ekri38|2020-01-06 08:56:02|How do you deal with thoughts of your partner being unfaithful?|"I (20M) am in a long distance relationship of 8 months with my gf (19F). She has never done anything to make me distrust her or make me feel like she has cheated. Prior to our relationship becoming long distance she would make mild jokes trying to make me jealous, talking about a guy she used to have a crush on and the like. I am her first s/o so I took the jokes lightly and it didn't really bother me until I moved away. 

The situation which caused me to have to move away was one that destroyed my self confidence. I moved out of my student house and back home and as she needed a new place to stay she took over my room and rent under a new contract. Her new roommates are all good friends of mine (males, she is the only girl in the house) and I don't have any issues with them, they're trustworthy guys.

Once I moved the jokes started to get to me. I never had issues with anxiety like this in any other relationship. And after seeing some posts here I realized how truly destructive that jealousy enducing behavior can be. Once she stated she was upset because ""the person she was sleeping with wasn't me"" (it was her female friend that slept over but didn't clarify until the next day). I confronted her about it and she has stopped since. 

However, despite this I have fallen into a spiral of overthinking simple situations and become extremely paranoid of her cheating. I have explained the situation to her and have been trying to work through it but at least 2-3 times a week I have to deal with the internal stress of different situations that make it seem so real in my head. 

I am going to be speaking to a professional about this soon and frequently talk with her about it to ease my mind but it's building stress up on me and in our relationship. 

The current predicament I am in mentally is that she went to bed at 1am. At 2:30 am she snap chatted me saying she woke up to go the bathroom. She didn't look groggy like you would if you woke up after an hour or so of sleep. She also complained she was hot and sweaty when she got up. This was odd because she's usually a cold person and she went to bed in underwear only (we video called up until she went to bed initially). She then snapped me before going back to bed wearing her full flannel pajamas saying good night. Kinda off considering she just complained about being hot right? Well shortly after saying good night I sent a streak snap to my friend (19M) (her immediate room neighbor) and he saw it and went offline on all social media immediately after. So now I'm here overthinking what is going on, probably pointlessly. 

I'm not interested in the YoU ShOulD BreaK uP wiTh HeR ShES ObViOslY ChEAtiNG comments as this is likely just my brain choosing to see specific things.

Any suggestions on how to combat these thoughts or ease the tension would be greatly appreciated. Honestly it feels like I'm loosing my mind so any advice (except the above stated) would be awesome.

TLDR: overthinking about minor situations where I begin thinking my gf is cheating on me and want to find a way to stop my stupid brain from needlessly stressing me out."|Crowbar242L|False|https://redd.it/ekri38|6|1.0|0|11|1|relationship_advice
eks5l4|2020-01-06 10:08:31|Am I as awful of a person as I think and feel to be?|"I fucked up. I've been in this amazing relationship for a while now and honestly I really love my boyfriend. At the very start of last year, 2019, a lot in my life just started to go to shit all at once and I was really not okay. Quite far from okay honestly especially my mental state. A few months further into the year, things kept getting worse, it was taking toll on me and that effected my relationship. We ended up splitting but still talked as if we were together or getting back together. In the time we were broken up, a lot of jealousy and things came up... I also ended up developing feelings for someone I didn't think I would have. Nothing happened between the other guy and I but I decided I had to be truthful and tell my ex about these feelings and it did not go well. I cut off the other guy and after a bit got back with my ex (now current boyfriend). Its been quite a bit of time since all this has happened and every moment I have tried to fix my relationship and gain his trust again as well as make him know that I only have love for him. Despite my effort, my boyfriend honestly hates me in my eyes. Of course I know that he loves me but he also seems to resent me. He does not trust me, I believe he tries to, and he tells me how disgusted he is of me and how I am filthy or used in his eyes. I love him, with every part and being of me, but I simply have no idea how to make things up to him. All I want is to be good enough for him again but I feel as though I never will be. I want to marry him and make him happy but he is so disgusted by me. All I want to know is, will I ever be enough again? Am I really just some disgustingly awful stupid person as I feel..?

ekxd9p|2020-01-06 17:39:44|Ex (M23) asked out my roommate (F24)|" 

I (F24) am getting my MPH in a small town. Last semester some drama happened — an ex? I guess? of mine (who is also my neighbor) (M23) asked out one of my roommates (F24). We were all friends and I was extremely hurt by his actions because he met both of us at the same time and just wanted to hook up with me, but asked her out. I told my roommate she should go for it but she told him no and I thought that was it. This semester though, we’re all in the same classes and have to work with each other on group things. I can’t help but feel sad and jealous and weirdly paranoid when he gives her attention or when she dresses up for class and things like that. It seems to me that he wants to keep trying to pursue her, and he seems to like her even more. I feel like he thinks that she’s being noble and not dating him because she is being a loyal friend to me but she’s told me she’s just not interested in him. On the other hand, he just avoids me in person and on social media which is fine. I understand that not everyone is going to like me and that doesn’t make them a terrible person. I’m not upset with him for having feelings for someone else but I was angry and hurt because of the way he pursued it. By just letting things fizzle out/ ghosting me and then cornering her at a bar when I wasn’t there and asking her to dinner without really considering how it would make me feel. I have to be around this girl 24/7 and a lot of my friends were also his friends. Obviously I know this dude is not meant for me, is not into me, is not my problem/ business, but having to be around him is affecting my mental health. It brings up a lot of insecurities and feelings of not being good enough. My question is what’s a good way to help me stop feeling like this? How do I move on from this and not let it affect me? 

I tried talking to a professional and did not feel comfortable opening up to the school’s therapist because they go to the same one. Other therapists are located an hour and half away and I just don’t have the time to drive back and forth. I’ve considered online therapy but I can’t really afford it right now."|camouflag3d|False|https://redd.it/ekxd9p|1|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice

With myself for the last couple of weeks i've been dealing with my father cheating on my mother of 25 years, and it's one of the worst things I've experienced. My moms threatening her life and i talked to her for hours which i never though it would be something i'd do. that being said.. I tell my girlfriend everything that's going on, and i'm an emotional ass guy and this is taking an overall toll on me. 

My girlfriend starts nursing school next week and I've been breathing down her neck because i don't have anyone else to talk to but her. She says I've been stressing her out a lot lately by blowing up her phone a bit and i totally get that. She wants to go into school stress free for herself, and she wants me to be there for my sister and my mom. She also said she wants me to get on track with my career and financial situation.. I understand everything she's saying and i agree. It's very had to go through, and i'm not sure if we're actually broken up or if she just wants some space for the temporary time being? I really don't want to lose her and I've never loved harder for someone before. I just have to respect her space right? just focus on me so when we talk again we can have a stronger relationship? im friends with her family everyone, she hasn't removed any photos of us.. we just aren't going to be talking. I just don't know what to think or do. 

I never thought my entire life i would have to go through all of this at once. It's one of the hardest things to go through, she always said she loves me and was there for me giving advice when she went through some stuff, but the whole break thing just hit me sideways, i just want to know if we just need some space or if this relationship is done.. I don't want to text her anymore, and again she hasn't removed anything. this is just fucking tough man."|Harowyn|False|https://redd.it/ekxc48|1|1.0|0|6|1|relationship_advice

There's this guy (20) who I am romantically interested in, who is also interested in me (18) and we've known each other since early last year. We talk fairly regularly through this messaging application which I won't name because there's a chance if I do he might see this, fill in the blanks and realize that it's me and then that might end to a very strange conversation of why I'm asking this on reddit.   
 

So the thing is, while we're both interested in each other, we're not exactly a couple yet (at least not officially). That being said, you know how some couples take pictures together? I wanted to ask to get a picture together next time we meet in person, which might be pretty soon. This would be the first time we would get one with us together, which would be nice but...  
 

He's said before in our conversations that he's camerashy/doesn't like being in photos in general. While I respect that and would never pressure him to take one with me, in the back of my mind I'd really like a picture with him. I'm not talking about a lot of them, like for example I have one relative who has about 1000 with this one guy shes been with for 2 months. Just one would be good enough for me, especially since we don't get to meet in person as often as most others.  
 

I know that it's selfish, to ask him to do something that he probably wouldn't be comfortable with which is why I thought of using reddit to ask for advice. Oh and if more information is needed, feel free to leave a comment and I'll try to respond as quickly as I can!  
 

TL;DR I want a picture together with the person I'm interested in and he's camera shy. Should I ask him about it or just let it go?"|SingingShower|False|https://redd.it/ekxc3u|1|1.0|0|2|1|relationship_advice
ekudw3|2020-01-06 13:50:11|Am I wrong?|"Hi, I'm going stir crazy here and need some advice from faceless strangers.

Have been with my husband for 16 years.  He's always been a big texter, phone addict.  His family and friends live some distance away, so of course there is a need for that contact.

I would like to say we started long distance ourselves.  I was never a jealous girlfriend.  Very chill.  He has plenty of hobbies, friends etc outside of the marriage.

However.

A few years ago he started working with a young girl.  They bonded, began texting endlessly.  At the time I had just had our daughter, had horrendous PPD.  I felt he was being weird with his phone so I hold my hands up, i snooped.  And I found endless conversations.  Compliments 'you'd be the prettiest girl in the club.'  He was very enamoured with her party lifestyle.  I am the complete opposite.  I got very jealous.  Insecure.  Eventually, it was dialled down.

Cut to a year or so ago.

Weirdness with phone again.  I snooped.  I knew the signs.  Sex chat sites.  Fake names.  Dirty talk.  I asked him not to do it again.  A month later, I found he was.  Again, I said how heartbroken it made me.  It seemed to stop.

I'm a very anxious person, always have been. He doesn't cope well with my anxiety.  I have to not let it ruin my day.

 We've had a tough year last year.  He got close to our neighbour.  Again, young female.  Texting for hours.  Waiting til I'm in bed asleep to text.  Slipping off to the bathroom to text.  I sure snooped.  I could see some messages had been deleted.  What was there was chit chat,and compliments again 'want to be the first to wish you a merry xmas', 'you make everything so easy'.  Theyd started taking dog walks together.  He was popping up for cups of tea a few times a week.

Again, she is the opposite of me.  Once again in the same way as the other attractive young lady.

And then it hits again.  I actually caught him on sex chat sites.

You bet I'm jealous and insecure now.  And I keep freaking out about any contact he has with this girl.  It's still every day pretty much but dialled down to a few texts.  He has promised to dial it back but to be honest, that's not enough for me.  I want it to stop.  He says he thinks I don't trust him.  He doesn't understand why I am so insecure, and that I just think they're fucking behind my back.

I told him.

He is having an emotional affair.

I feel like mug, trodden in to the ground.  The thing is I love him to bits and I'm still hanging on to the thought that he wouldnt physically cheat on me but that means very little at the moment.  Emotionally,he has.  He sees nothing wrong with what he has done."|wharmpess90|False|https://redd.it/ekudw3|2|1.0|0|26|1|relationship_advice
ekxalg|2020-01-06 17:34:23|Girlfriend wants more time together, doesn't understand I need my personal time/space|"Hi there redditors, my situation is as follows: (sorry for the lengthy rant)

A little backstory: (18M)I've been dating my current (18F) SO for about 2 and a half years, since the end of our sophomore year. Well, seeing as we were from the same class, we spent a fair bit of dead time together (aka school breaks, study hall etc...) which I was totally fine with, because that would be time that I wouldn't be doing anything else so I saw no problem (prefered it even) spending it with her. The thing that you must know is, although I'm an extrovert, one thing that I always needed was my ""me time"" whether that was playing video games, working out, just chilling listening to music...wtv, and although she had/has a hard time understanding it, we'd be mostly fine. Another thing you need to know is that my SO has no hobbies of her own besides going out with friends and dating me (even though I'm always telling her that she needs to figure who she is as an individual). This is reevant later.

Fast forward to now, we are both in college (same uni, different courses) and, to put it simple, college has been a hard time for both of us. The way I have for dealing with the issues in my life are the things that I mentioned before (my ""me time"") and now more than ever I feel like I need them to releave all the stress. Well, now that we are not together on those ""dead times"" my girlfriend is expecting me to spend A LOT more time with her which, you know, I understand. Thing is, the amout of time she wants is unreasonable for me and I could never do it  (we were talking and for her 4 FULL afternoons together is totally fine). Currently she is mad (and can't be reasoned with) at me because I told her that we need to find mutual ground and she needs to find hobbies for herself as I can't be her only source of entertainment/activity, but right she is even questioning if I love her because I can't spend that much time with someone. 

I really love this girl (I know we are still young and all that, I know, not what I'm asking though), but if she keeps getting mad at me for being who I am I don't know how we are gonna work this out... Any advice?

ekuc92|2020-01-06 13:46:18|My boyfriend is my first relationship. It’s been eventful and I’m terrible at knowing what to do.|"Me [F26] and my boyfriend [M25] have been dating for over two years now. 
Some background, I have bipolar depression. It’s in my family and it became noticeable in me when my brother died when I was 13. 
I never dated anyone, I was never asked out and after one botch attempt (Im black and a guy in high school I liked told me he didn’t prefer black girls.)I never asked anyone. 
My sister then died before I met my boyfriend.
I wasn’t close to her, but I realized I wasn’t doing much with my life and I didn’t know where it would take me.

I met my boyfriend on a video game, Overwatch if you want to know, and we talked like best friends the first night and the weeks after we were playing and watching everything together and vidchatting. I realized I never had a connection with someone like this before, we really clicked and were open with each other, to the point I really liked him. He and I were similar in many ways, rough beginnings, the outlier in the families, looking for something meaningful. I realized probably two months in that he liked me back, when I would hear him stammer and slip up flirts. I was the one to ask him out and he said yes.
We had our first “date” when Last Jedi came out, something he was excited (and ultimately very disappointed) about by going to go see it at a same showtime and texting each other our reactions as it was happening.

I at the time worked at a call center and the job was horrendous. I hated calling people and being yelled at all day about bills and I had a coworker I had to threaten when he touched my hair without my permission. (I mean he had his hands in my hair sexually while I was on a call, damn near almost got fired cause I wanted to turn around and strangle him.) My Bf convinced me to leave that job and I found a new one with his encouragement. It didn’t pay as much, but it took all the stress off of me.
We were both very happy and wanted to meet each other.

A year in He got a lot of hours at his job to save up originally to come visit me on a bus, but eventually he told me that he wasn’t happy where he lived now. I would always hear fighting and yelling behind him. He asked me if he came could he stay with me, and I told him yes. I had a small high priced apartment I shared with my sick mom, and we could use the company since the only visitor we would have is my father. 
He bused up from Georgia to me in New York, and things were great. He got a job, we went out for walks and I showed him the city we lived in and it was amazing. We talked of one day in the future getting married and having kids.
A few months went by and the first bad thing happened, he was fired after he missed a day sick and when he got back his manager and him had an argument about work not being done. I wasn’t mad he got fired, I told him that, and would support him while we looked for another. But ever since then he wasn’t the same, he started having a lot of self hate, even after he found a new one. He keeps placing this big burden on himself that he HAS to keep me happy, or he failed. I always told him that’s not how life works and we just have to be there for each other.

Things got worse when my car broke down and it took a month before we could afford to get it back up and running, something he blamed himself for.

Things kept happening. We got hit with a large medical bill when his insurance declined his hospital visit, car broke down again, dog got very sick, my Mom got very sick, I had to have surgery and couldn’t move out of bed for a month, and couldn’t move out of the house the month after. I felt awful these kept happening and I never could get him to understand that he was working hard and doing it right without it becoming an argument.

Going to kind of where we are at now. My father died, car accident. And it hurt. My bf was there for me and my mother, and we got hit with more. My father left his multi unit house immediately to me and it was run down. We were forced to move in cause we had to start using our money to clear my father hoarded apartment out and fix the others so the tenants that have been neglected wouldn’t leave and we could get income from them. My boyfriends job wouldn’t transfer and we found out the hard way that the area my dad lived in takes in hires rarely. Even more, We found out my father was 20k behind on back taxes and foreclosing was on the horizon. All I could do was cry almost everyday, and that hurt my bf.

Everything has been so hectic, but now, after 3 months of fear and sadness of the unknown I had found a letter from my dads life insurance, filed it, and it was just enough to pay the back taxes and fix the house. A clear air has come back. But I’m afraid of the toll it’s had on him.
I can’t get more of an “I’m fine.” from him but I feel like it’s been too much at once and I don’t know how to make him feel better. I never got to see my parents support each other when things get bad, they argued and fought and eventually left each other, so now I wonder if there was something I should be doing or saying to help him not hate himself and give up. 

That’s where he is now. He often has to be prodded to do a chore, he now hates applying for a job and calling for a job cause of the rejections he has been getting, and he rarely plays his games or watches a movie with enjoyment. He just says that he’s sorry he doesn’t have a job or had the knowledge to fix a house himself or have any money to prevent most of what we went through. What should I tell him? Does he just need time and luck with a job? I want him to be happy again and I strongly believe that if we got through all of this trauma in a span of two years we basically did what breaks most marriages, and that we can get through anything.

ekx9ck|2020-01-06 17:31:59|I (35m) have been seeing a (22f) for 12 months and i feel like i should finish it but i love her....|"Longtime lurker but never posted so created a throwaway to get some opinions on my situation and i guess to see if anyone who has been in a similar thing can help.

So i am seeing an amazing girl who is only 22, i am 35 and was with my last partner for nearly 15 yrs and we have 2 wonderful kids. For a few reasons but mainly me changing and feeling like id somehow missed out i left.  

(I still see my kids regular and help my ex financially before anyone asks)

&#x200B;

We get on incredibly well and she makes me feel alive, we have so  much fun and when we are together its incredible. 

I have ended it with her a few times because i feel she is too young.

Shes been to uni and had lots of sexual partners, she does stage shows and is in a acapella band.  Acted in Shrek, Wizard of OZ etc etc...regularly attends house parties, city breaks has a huge social circle and has high following on instagram and facebook.  Now all this is fine and its everything a 22yr old should be doing.  

But for me it just creates anxiety and worry.  

We split for a short while a few months ago,

(because of how i feel insecure about her lifestyle and not knowing what i want, sometimes i feel like i should just try and go home if its an option, fix things with my wife and be content i miss my family) 

and she had been messaging someone, slept with a guy from work and slept with a guy from one of her shows (we were not together at this point and i wasn't sat at home lets just say) but kept in touch with me the whole time, staying in my mind.

So things settled down and we now see each other regularly maybe 3 times a week, it costs her a fortune on the train and she doesn't earn loads but shes trying, like really trying.  Says she wants kids with me (in time) and to move in together in September when our tenancies are up.

She says she loves me and when i try to end it she gets distraught and begs and pleads then i feel guilty like i should just push these doubts down.

So for me the high risk to cheating situations she is in for example parties, drinking, shows, gigs, trips, her previous promiscuity, public social media (another note but a close friend of hers sent a dm to a minor celeb and she is now sleeping with him!) this to me is all so foreign and unfamiliar.... 

&#x200B;

Am i just being  a pussy?  Im 35 and have seen enough to know that a relationship like this has so much more risk of failure..

Should i just get out now, block her (as hard as this will be) and focus on myself.  

She is desperate for me to commit and i am in love with her but i feel like im setting myself up to get hurt here and would rather protect myself than waste time running around with someone so young..

I appreciate some of u will say just take the risk, life is about risks etc but i have seen enough in the last year to have a picture in my mind of her that makes me feel it will inevitably go wrong no matter how much she insists she wants to be with me forever.

&#x200B;

I love how needy she is with me but those are traits of someone who attention seeks.

I will probably add to this .

ekx92c|2020-01-06 17:31:23|When should I tell my boyfriend that I want to break up? (Very complicated situation)|"I (22f) am Canadian but I study in the UK. Here I met my boyfriend (23). He is English. We've been together for two years and I've known for very early on that he doesn't want to move to Canada ever. He always says he loves me but he wouldn't want me to stay just for him if I were unhappy otherwise. We saw my uni time here as some sort of trial run for the future. I've been quite happy here and I love my boyfriend to death. But lately I realised that I want to return to Canada. I like England and I was happy here but I just can't live here forever. For the last 3 years I've seen my family only five times. Canada is my home and I just don't feel that way about England. I'm incredibly sad but I know I'll eventually be glad that I went back. 

Obviously this means my boyfriend and I will have to break up since staying in England is non negotiable for him and we can't be in a ldr forever. The thing is I think my boyfriend thinks that I'm going to stay. I always said that I don't know and that I'll decide eventually but the way he acts makes me think that he's certain I'll decide in his favour. But I haven't. 

The semester is pretty much over and our lease ends by the end of January. I'm planning on going back after that. I don't need more time for my decision I know that I will not stay and I know that his stance hasn't changed because I sussed it out. So when should I tell him? If I do it now we'll still have to live together for 3 more weeks and it will just be sad and awkward but I also feel bad for keeping him in the dark. It would be very abrupt if I just tell him 2 days before I leave and telling him when I'm gone (I planned to go visit my family anyway) just feels wrong.

Over the past few weeks, I’ve(27F) questioned my 4year relationship with my SO(29M) and it’s been very difficult. I’ve desperately hoped it would work and he would make some changes. I’ve also realised that not once in our relationship has he mentioned his plans about having kids, marriage, buying a house together. Surely this is something couples talk about over a 4 yr relationship? I feel like he’s basically just relying on me to make all the decisions and I’m done.

I’ve decided its best to end our relationship but I’m unsure how to do so. He’s the first partner I’ve moved in with and we are currently still living together(renting). I still do care about him but I feel we are better off seperate. I feel he’s gotten too comfortable in our relationship and he’s  basically let himself go which in turn is causing me to be quite bitter towards him.

After graduating aged 23 I started to learn to drive again but my anxiety still affected me and I stopped driving. I started working a year later and couldn't fit in lessons anymore, plus public transport where I live is generally okay, so I can get around and I've not needed to drive. 5 years later I still don't drive.

I am Southamerican, and do not have European citizenship.
I have been doing Working Holiday Visas which only last 12 months for the last 3 years and I met him when I was doing the one in France. 

He has been coming to see me in Sweden once a month every month since I left Paris, he spends all his money and time to come see me, he wants  a future with me and he wants me to join him back in France, problem is, we do not know how.

Marriage has come up in the conversation, and he has told me that if he will marry me, it will not be under these circumstances. He believes marriage is an "" institution"" and that  he would never do it as a substitute for a visa.

I am puzzled because I feel that visas and immigration laws will separate us, student visa or relationship visas are hard and super long processes, that require tens of thousands of euros which I don't have. 

We had a long conversation in which we both cried and I feel he is helpless, he is sad because he has a lot of pressure with the marriage situation. 

I feel like I come from another school of thought where I don't believe marriage is something important, and in this case, it would show his unconditional love to me, to be able to make me stay by his side. 

A lot of people have said that he doesn't truly love me because of the marriage thing, but he does show love everyday by all the sacrifices he makes to see me and be together with me during holidays and important times.

I love him so much, but we haven’t always been on the same page with that we want in our lives. I have wanted to get married for the past year or two and start a family, where as he is not ready at this time. This is totally understandable and okay for him to feel- but it doesn’t seem fair that I have to hold off what I want in my life for someone in order for them to be happy. 

We have talked in the past and he does want to get married and have kids, just in years down the road... but I don’t want to wait that long... it’s been hard for the past few years as I’ve tried to tell myself my worth is not based upon what I am to him. But it isn’t easy to not wonder what is wrong with me or why I am not worthy or being his wife or a mother. 

At this point in my life I don’t know how to do a lot of “adult” things without him. I depend on him for my loneliness, and to keep me okay; which isn’t okay. But I don’t want him out of my life, I want him forever. 

There are a lot of things I think we need to work at as individuals. We have depended on each other for a long time and although I want to be with him forever, I think it would be really healthy for us to try to live separate from each other for a year or so. But, I just know him as a person and I don’t think he would ever be okay with that.

How much time should you spend on a hobby vs responsibilities as an adult?|"Me (25F) and my partner (30M) have been together a little over two years now and I would consider our relationship to be a very serious and happy one. **Let me also start this off by saying I love video games** and I've played them since I was very little. When I met my boyfriend he found out a had a PS and he asked for gamertag and we started getting to know each other and eventually started dating. It was great being able to play with someone! Growing up my girl friends had no interest in games and my guy friends often dismissed me because I was a girl. So needless to say games are somewhat of an important part of our relationship. I like that I can feel and act like a kid with him, its one of my favorite parts of our relationship. However...

We moved into a house a year ago and I have been in school as well. The responsibilities of adulthood are no joke and has definitely gotten to us both. He makes good money working full-time at a manual labor job and often works overtime. Lately I've been so busy that I don't have an interest in playing with him anymore, although I'd like to. **The main problem for me is that my boyfriend seems so think it's okay to come home after work and play for 3-4 hours everyday and to me, as an adult that seems unrealistic.** Video games are more of a treat to me I can go weeks without playing any but I can also spend three weeks playing the shit out of game it just depends on if there's any good games out. Games are an experience to me I get caught up in the lore or the soundtrack or get attached to the characters. Whereas **my boyfriend says he sees it as a way to escape, or to numb his mind and avoid reality.**

He's literally admitted that to me. He'll play good games, crappy games it doesn't matter as long as it distracts him. Not all days are bad and he usually goes through phases. **It gets in the way of real life sometimes like when he forgets to let the dogs out and they poop or pee on the floor.** I feel like I'm pretty understanding of it all because I know what its like to be into a game but it seems like he may have somewhat of an unhealthy addiction. He's also told me that he's often feels unfulfilled or empty inside, I've suggested a more physical hobby so he could actually see the fruit of his labors. He started woodworking in the basement and really liked it but we got sick from all the sawdust so he stopped that for now.

Now I know some people especially some women (including my close friends) hate games or don't understand them altogether and consider men who play games to be losers or whatever but obviously I don't see it that way and **I don't want to leave him or break up with him I'm just looking for some insight about whether or not his habits are unhealthy or if he may be addicted.** Maybe I am being to critical I'm not sure. I've been trying to get us to start a healthier lifestyle together (we've both gotten severely unhealthy over the past 1.5 years) and it seems like the games always get it the way. I know he's capable of it because he was very fit when we met. Just last night all I wanted to do was take 15 minute walk around the block with our dogs and he pouted like a child. Anyway please help I'm kind of at a loss.

What should I do?|"He didn’t have my pics on his phone so I took one of me without telling him so he could have a little surprise next time he opens his photo gallery. I do occasionally send him pics of myself (mostly nudes, but ordinary pics too) but he never saves them since he can always access them via the app we use for communication. Or so he told me. I didn’t have a problem with it until yesterday. I accidentally saw that he deleted that pic I took on his phone. I asked him why and he tried to answer in a joking manner saying someone else deleted it. I didn’t believe him bc I know he doesn’t give his phone to anyone and it has a passcode (even I don’t know it). In the end he told me that yes he deleted it and when I kept asking why, he said because he didn’t want someone else to accidentally see me. That he personally can always access my pics on that other app. What upset me was that I took that pic specifically for him, thinking it’ll make him smile, only for him to delete it and then give me some bullshit excuse in return. Like who is even gonna see my photo on his phone when he never gives it to anyone in the first place? It wasn’t a nude or anything like that either, just a pic of me smiling at camera. So why would he do that? 

And its not like he hides our relationship. I know his family, am friends with his cousin and he told about me to his closest friends. In fact we are getting married soon. So this situation is just confusing. Why would he delete it? Why wouldn’t he want to have photos of me and us on his phone? He has pics of himself, his friends and his nephews, but not one of myself or us together. Is this something to be worried about or am I overreacting? 

And honestly, I’m not asking him to take pics of me all the time, neither do I ask him to save all the pics I send him. I don’t care about that. But why did he go all the way to deleting that one harmless photo of myself instead of just letting it be? He’s fine with having a hundred memes and funny pics on his phone. I really don’t know how to react to that. It’s been two days and I’m still thinking about it. It seems like a small thing but it’s bothering me so much. Should I let it go or should I talk to him about it one more time?

I’m a uni student and I’m currently trying to pick a two-bedroom place with my friend (Ken) for our final year. To be blunt, the issue is I have money to live somewhere nice and he doesn’t. We currently live together with another mutual friend but this friend isn’t continuing his studies. 

Our current house is very cheap and in a pretty poor neighbourhood; it’s not the type of place that you’d feel safe walking about at night and it’s also a solid 40+ minutes outside of town. Unless you’re willing to take a lengthy bus ride, the place is very dead in terms of facilities. There is no gyms within 20 minutes, that are any good for the price they charge and all the pubs are filled with fairly aggressive locals. There is two big food shops though which is very handy.

As well as this, there is practically no greenery around us, except for a cemetery, adding to the already depressive and unwelcoming vibe the area cultivates. The locals just aren’t friendly; I’m not saying all of them are assholes or anything but I’m used to a place where people smile at each other and look happy. Another big issue is the rubbish that is just dumped in the street, people take no pride in the area, with glass bottles thrown in the street. The people here glare at you as you walk by them, I think this is because the locals don’t like the students living here. 
Ken’s reason for wanting to live around this area again is because it’s cheap. 

Both my friends were a year ahead of me and so I’m going into my third year whilst Ken is going on to do a Masters.  This was not something he planned from the start but something he has wanted to do from around October 2019 full well knowing my desire to live in the city next year. We almost didn’t live together last year because of the same disagreement. 
However, I compromised on where to live last year as I thought it was going to be the last year the three of us would be together and I do enjoy their company; I was happy to put up with the area because it was only a year out of my life. Also, most of my friends live around the area as well - generally within 10 minutes walk of each other - but, as they are all currently third years and not continuing their studies, they are all leaving next year. The only reason to stay in this area is because it’s cheap, it’s not even a shorter walk to Uni than it would be if we lived in the city.

Living alone is something I’ve always been keen on and i was going to do it last year until a friend convinced me to. I’m more than prepared to do it next year but Ken does not have anyone else to live with. 

Is it fair on Ken if I ditch him and just pick a place in the city; I guess what I’m really asking is, do you think I’m being a massive dick by not wanting to live with him because he can’t afford a nicer place?"|GoldenGateBore|False|https://redd.it/eku7cp|2|1.0|0|23|1|relationship_advice

I feel like I will wait years for the military guy to get a divorce and idk if I'm strong enough to be separated for months or even a year when he's deployed. I do love him but we both know I dont love him as much as he loves me. I still love my ex more, I feel like i will never love anyone as much as him. Is it just the fact that we've been together for so long? My Military guy is everything i wanted in my ex but he isn't my ex. What do I do? My military guy says he wants to spend the rest of his life with me but I dont know if I can give him the love he gives me. I always envisioned marrying my ex but he had a decade to get it right and it wont be the same, the trust. And 15 years caused our families to be one so I still talk to him often due to our families bond.|Nc2Tx90|False|https://redd.it/ekx2u2|1|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice

Sorry for formatting, I've never done an update and I'm on mobile. So he broke up with me last night out of nowhere. He said he had has small doubts about our relationship that he always ignored and he went to a concert with her Friday night and realized he was thinking about her in a more than friend way. He left me with 0 closure, detailed his feelings for Emily, and kept hinting that things weren't really over and he might decide he was wrong and come back. I told him i'm not waiting for him and to stop playing with my feelings. I was the one that asked several times through the long back and forth - are we over? I feel absolutely destroyed. I've been in 2-3 year long relationships that didn't make me feel as amazing as he did. He said he worried a relationship with me was 'too comfortable and easy'. This is the second guy in a row to leave me for a female friend.  I don't know why I'm never good enough.

eku63j|2020-01-06 13:30:43|I (28F) feel like my bf (31M) doesn’t really want to be with me|"TLDR: I started dating a guy, we made things exclusive, but I wonder if he is actually into me, if we should break up, or if I’m just overthinking.

I met this guy unexpectedly a few months ago and we hit it off. We started hanging out pretty regularly and after a few months made things exclusive. Here are the issues:

**I was planning a cross-country move before I met him.**
It is a dream of mine to live somewhere else and I put that in the back burner because of past relationships. Since I had been single for a while (2 years), I figured nothing was holding me back anymore and started planning it.
I told him about this plan from the beginning and he didn’t voice any concern, nor ask anything about it... It was surprising! But instead of pushing to confirm he was truly okay with it, I moved on.
Before making things exclusive, we both agreed that my potential move was cause for concern: should we invest our energy into this or cut our losses early on? We went with the former and agreed to reassess a bit closer to the move.
The thing is that the move is not 100% confirmed. I’ve been single for so long (I’m also very independent/individualistic) so I’m fine with flip flopping when huge decisions are involved since I’m the only one impacted. We never talk about the move, though. Most likely because we’re afraid of where the conversation will go and I’m not sure how much I should involve him in my planning since we are not that serious yet? And him not asking about it makes me wonder if he even cares?

**different communication styles**
My past partners have made it clear that they were into me. Mostly by telling me verbatim but also by being inquisitive about me, my life, my dreams, etc...
He doesn’t really do that. He doesn’t express his feelings much, except for this one time I made a mistake and upset him. And when we talk, although it’s usually fun and lighthearted, I tend to ask more questions.
I sometimes wonder if he’s excited at all to have me in his life or if he is dating me because the opportunity fell on his lap??

**we both have walls up**
My walls are mostly related to the fact that I can’t read him and thus, don’t feel entirely safe to let my emotions flow. I get attached easily and don’t want to invest more of my feelings if he doesn’t plan on reciprocating.
His walls are probably due to my move. I also suspect that there is some baggage from a previous heartbreak – we’ve loosely discussed past relationships and while he has no issue talking about all of them, he doesn’t want to talk about a specific one. I respect that, but also wonder if that’s a flag?

I’ve thought about ending it a few times already but every time I’m about to, we end up having a great time, then I remember why I started liking him in the first place. We’re compatible in ways that I think are important: he’s kind, funny, ambitious, creative, a great listener, and loves his friends dearly.

I’ve been known to get stuck in relationships because I am always willing to make things work but I don’t want this to happen again. I am planning on talking to him but I’m not sure how to approach it yet. Will this be a talk where I check in with him and our feelings or will this be a fatal talk? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

I guess what I’m asking is, would you break up with your SO? Would you just talk to them and see where things go? Help?"|lesoleildonne|False|https://redd.it/eku63j|2|1.0|0|2|1|relationship_advice
ekx1f5|2020-01-06 17:15:53|My brother (23M) and his fiancé (23F) are clearly not ready for marriage. Should I try to find a way to tell him or would it blow up in my face?|"There have been so many red flags in their relationship, most of which just boils down to immaturity. They’re just young and don’t know what a compatible partnership looks like. I don’t think the fiancé is a bad person, but she and my brother just don’t seem like a great match. They don’t seem to respect each other all that much. When they got engaged they said they wanted a really long engagement but seem to be having the wedding sooner rather than later. They’ve made absolutely no attempt to include my family in any of the planning, which I know hurts my mom a lot as she and my brother used to be close before they got together. 

I feel like trying to tell him this directly is a bad idea, as he’ll just get mad and probably talk to me less than he already does. But it sucks to just let it happen. I don’t want him to get divorced at a young age, but it’s his life and I want to be supportive. Any advice would be great."|em57863|False|https://redd.it/ekx1f5|1|1.0|0|15|1|relationship_advice
ekx0xy|2020-01-06 17:14:53|Very new relationship and a hospitalized mother.|"Hi all
I’m a 36 y/o female and I just started dating “J”, a 33 y/o male. The relationship is very young, as in 3 dates young.  But we text multiple times a day, and we both seem to be on the same page in terms of how we’re feeling, and have agreed that we’d like the relationship to progress.  I went as far as to cancel another date because I liked him, and let him know I did that.   He “checks in” between work and whatnot, and had planned to go out with my friends and I for an event.   Everything is/was going along swimmingly. 
Yesterday, I received a text from him stating that his mother was rushed to the ER with a dire health issue and that things “weren’t looking good”, and that he had to cancel our plans for the following night (tonight)
Of course this isn’t an issue with me at all- it’s your family- go take care of them.   My issue is how to proceed from here.   I sent him one follow up text approximately 8 hours later, basically saying I was thinking of him, and am here if he needs anything.  
Since then, I’ve not heard from him.   I don’t want to bother him, but I also want him to know that I’m thinking about him, and honestly I’d kind of like to know what’s going on.   
My anxiety is telling me that he’s going to use this to push me away, however all previous signs indicated otherwise.  
How do I proceed?  I definitely don’t want to come off as needy, or pissy bc he isn’t paying attention to me, bc he’s obviously got more important tasks at hand.  

Should I wait to hear from him?  Should I send a “hows everything/thinking of you” text?   Should I call?

Advice much appreciated!!

Edit: I just want to be clear about the fact that I totally understand he’s going to need time.  I’m just not sure how to be there for him at the moment."|kgre5738|False|https://redd.it/ekx0xy|1|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice
ekx0sk|2020-01-06 17:14:33|She loves me, she loves me not|" 

Hi everyone! I am a nineteen year old dude from Sweden (19M) in my first serious relationship right now. She is seventeen (F17) and we have been together for around 4 months and are both quite new at this thing.

Yesterday when we were in bed she started having an anxiety attack and I asked her what was up. Due to childhood trauma she has a lot of issues talking about her problems and what she feels at times, so I asked her to write a text instead describing what was up.

After a period of time I got the text (which was really courageous of her to write, she has issues with these types of things and it makes me very glad that she feels comfortable enough with me that she could share it).

In it she wrote that she likes me a lot, that she feels comfortable with me and that I make her very happy, but that she is confused about what she wants us to be. She said that lately she has felt uncomfortable having sex with me due to these doubts and her not knowing whether she looks at me in a romantic way or something else, and that she cant ""decide"" which is very hard on her because she then feels that she is lying to me and to herself, and it she tells me she will feel one way or another.

We talked a bit about it, and I told her that doubts in a relationship is something that is totally normal and we both agreed to refrain from sex for a while so that she could work these things out. We have still slept together and been together much of the time since then, and we still kiss and say I love you and such things and nothing much has really changed, except me knowing what she is going through and me telling her that she can always talk to me and that I love her very much.

She also told me that she has had this issue in relationships in the past but hasn't told anyone, which ultimately made the relationships fail, but she told me and that makes me feel like she values me and wants me to know so that we can work on it together.

After she told me this, we started making out and had some of the best sex we have ever had with both me and her coming, even though we said that we would take a paus. I was not the one initiating this and I asked her several times if she really wanted to due to the things she just brought up and what we agreed on, but she said she wanted to.

We talked a bit in the morning about this and she told me that she has issues with sharing stuff like this because of her relationship with her dad who can be very aggressive, and this has lead to her only relying on herself. She told me that she gets very anxious about these thoughts because it makes her feel like she cant trust herself, which is the only person she has been able to trust in the past.

So my question is just, these kinds if feelings are normal in a relationship right? I know both she and me wants to work through this and I know we both love each other, but it's just hard seeing her go through this and it makes me feel a bit bad. Is there anything you guys would recommend me talking with her about or something?

TL;DR

Girlfriend of four months is confused about our relationship, whether she wants it to be romantic or not which is very hard on her and me and I'm wondering whether these feelings are normal and how to talk with her about it, since we are both not so experienced.

eksslj|2020-01-06 11:16:15|I don't know wether or not to break up with my girlfriend ant University who I live a long way from.|Me and this girl are both in 1st year and live in the same flat and about a month into uni we got together. Neither of us had had a relationship before and we didn't want to mess anything up and especially didn't want any awkwardness around the flat if it went wrong so we agreed to take it slowly and just see what would happen. This soon flew out the window tho and it ended up going really fast to the point where a month in we were basically an old married couple staying in our rooms and only spending time with each other. I didn't mind it at the time but now I realized that I never actually solidified a fried group because I left anyone I met to spend all my time with this girl. This means apart from my flatmates who I don't really like that much I don't really know anyone else at uni. Over the Christmas break she went back to her hometown and I went back to mine and we were both sad we wouldn't see each other but assured ourselves nothing would change cause we would call and message all the time. But the calling and messaging has become a lot less frequent and its at the point where it feels like a chore. I feel like how far we are from each other has made us very distant and not even want to talk to each other. I still feel like I love her but I don't know if I like her. She seemed to be struggling with the distance more than I did during the break and suggested multiple times that we break up, even a few days ago actually breaking up with me just to say it was a mistake. At the time I was really sad about it but now idk and I'm really confused. We're both meant to be going back up very soon ( a week earlier than normal just to spend a week together as planned at the begging of the break) but if I break up with her I'll have no one else there as not even my flatmates are coming back for at least a week so I don't know wether I should do it on the phone at home or see how I feel when I see her in person. I don't feel like this relationship would even work out in the long run because we spend 3 mints apart in the summer which would be impossible if 3 weeks had changed my feelings this much. I'm sorry if I'm rambling I just really want some advice on this. Cheers.|ThrowRA478276748|False|https://redd.it/eksslj|3|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice

(TW: Eating Disorder)|"My boyfriend (20sM) and I (20sF) have been together for a few months, but we were close friends first. Our relationship kind-of just happened after I broke up with my ex and we realised we had feelings for one another.

Now, I’ve had an eating disorder (anorexia to be specific) for about 4-5 years. I have a nasty habit of not eating, saying I’m not hungry when I am and generally just avoiding food. It started due to an issues I’ve had with me oesophagus since I was a child, and when I was a teen is came to a head and I stopped eating altogether. I told my boyfriend about this very early on in the relationship and he’s very supportive of helping me. I want to get better, but there’s a lot of mentality behind it that can hinder me. Because of other health issues, quite often I can feel sick after food and struggle to do almost anything because I feel so atrocious. When this happens he always comes to cuddle me and make sure I’m okay.

We’re very big on communication, and I’ve told him that sometimes when he brings up my weight (he always does so positively, by the way), it can make me feel bad, or self-conscious. Since then he’s tried to be more mindful of the way I’m feeling at the time when he mentions it, as it’s very obviously when I’m feeling blue or just not quite myself. 

What I need advice on, is how I can show my appreciation and thank him for all he’s doing to help me? He doesn’t have to do all this, and when I do thank him for looking out for me, he just says ‘Isn’t that what a boyfriends supposed to do?’  with a big , goofy grin on his face. I’d hate to think that me being this way weighs down on his mental health too; so I’d love to show him some proper appreciation for all this and let him know how much I care.

ekwz6v|2020-01-06 17:11:23|Am I (25M) in the wrong for being in a FWB relationship with my Ex-Girlfriend(23F)|"Am I out of order?

&#x200B;

So about 5 years ago me and this girl from college started chatting and we got along great. Needless to say within a few months we were officially bf/gf. It was good to start with but within a month we were arguing constantly. She HATED to see me with anyone else, male or female and we argued about this a lot. I guess the reason we stayed together was that when it was just me and her we always got along great. I always got the impression her family didn't like me but to this day I have no idea why.

&#x200B;

Anyway after about a year we had a messy breakup. It was during exam season, we were both super stressed and arguing literally 24 hours a day for a week or so. So I broke up with her, I loved her but we were both ruining our exams by arguing all day and not sleeping all night. Not to mention that I don't do well with stress. I thought it was the mature thing to do.

&#x200B;

So after this we don't speak for 6 months or so and then for whatever reason we get chatting again. Her family have a go at her for talking to me constantly but she does anyway. Eventually we start being friends again and all the way along im telling her that we should just be friends and nothing more and she always says she agrees. This eventually developed into a FWB situation that we've been in for the past two years or so. 

&#x200B;

I say to her on a weekly basis that it can't become more than that, that she can get a bf whenever she wants, she can do whatever she wants but she always agrees that at the moment she would rather just have what we do at the moment so that's what we do.

&#x200B;

So that brings us to this week, her family have been more intense than usual this week, constantly messaging her whenever she is out of the house to see if shes with me, constantly checking up on us and just being plain horrible behind my back constantly. 

&#x200B;

The reason is always different, here are a few examples:

\- That I'm just living off of her even though I ALWAYS pay my own way and sometimes pay hers.

\- That I'm never going to amount to anything even though I am at university and have always been top of the school at GCSE, A levels and I'm on track for a 1st at uni.

\- That I'm controlling, I have no idea where this came from. I couldn't be more passive. Our meets ups usually involve her texting me, asking to meet up, I drive to hers and pick her up, I ask where she wants to go, we go there, I take her home. I can't be any less controlling than that. She has full freedom to do whatever she wants, the only rule she has is that if she dates another guy she has to tell me, which i think is more than fair that I am atleast told if she starts loving or having sex with another guy.

&#x200B;

So this is my issue. Her family doing and saying these things really makes her upset all the time, and in her families eyes I am the bad guy. After a few years I can't hide that it really really gets to me, being constantly blamed even when her happiest times are when shes with me. I mean we are only friends at this point, at least in their eyes. Am I missing something or are they crazy? How many friends of yours have your parents said all stuff like this about a guy who is a high flyer, doesn't drink, doesn't party and doesn't cause her any unhappiness or anything??

&#x200B;

But of course there's no doubt that I enjoy our FWB relationship at the moment, but we are only here because it is what she wants. 

&#x200B;

Am I wrong to tell her that we can't be in a proper relationship again. I mean there's so many issues related to that that its just a no go. I mean after all this there's no way I could get along with her family again. Secondly I know how she behaves in a relationship and I just can't deal with it, alongside many other issues. I think this might be a sticking point, as much as she will always say she is happy, I know that deep down she wants to date me again. Does that mean I'm being manipulative in what we do? But I always say to her over and over again that this can't be a proper relationship and that she is always free to go off with someone else if she wants to. But she will always say she is happy with this? Maybe you guys would say that this is just trouble and that I should split up with her? But then we are both seemingly happy with the current arrangement and don't have too many other friends, then surely I would be the bad guy for just suddenly ditching her and saying that we can't talk anymore?

&#x200B;

So who is in the wrong? Am I really the bad guy in all this? Am I being selfish by being in a FWB relationship that I have no intention of making into a proper relationship? Even if she always tells me that she is happy with this? After a few years of this I have ran out of solutions and with it flaring up so bad this week I wanted some advice.

She felt attacked when I felt I didnt think she put in as much effort, to which I said that I never said she's putting in no effort, I said that it would be nice if it were more.

So fast forward a couple of days after this little debate, she has started to like a lot of pictures of quotes about being single, and being hurt, and one about should've kept him as a friend.

I met a guy online in game and we started playing together alot. We banter on discord and send memes, we have even video called. this all happened in a little less than a month. We added each other on other social media. Basically made a friend online. I used to play with him only when we first met since my other friends were on christmas holiday vacation . And then i started inviting other online friends (not as close just randos that i sometimes play together with) that i made along the way. I couldn't detect any signs of protest about it. And it wasnt as if we played exclusively with each other, he played with his friends and i could with mine.

We joke a lot about me being an e girl, so id joke an say oof ive found a new daddy or new god. He is literally 3 tiers higher than me in game. Im not sure why he plays with me, but its definitely not romantic dont get it twisted this is a very friend vibe zone. Ive also made if clear in deep convos that i dont date and dont believe in love. I also dont ask to be boosted, i just like playing with him too.like 2 days ago i started playing with another online friend (not as close) alot and id joke that hes my new god.

So anyways im like you wanna join our lobby and he says no. I brush it off like aight ok dont really mind. afterwards we continue the banter and he goes something along the lines of thank goodness youve found someone else to carry you and well see how fast you get dropped and isnt that new guy you new god. I make the joke that its a polytheistic religion and he is irreplaceable. All banter nothing crossed my head as a sign or watever. next thing i know he says listen im gonna answer the question you want to ask. I dont play with ppl i dont like. So i was like ""ok"", keep in mind i was in game so i didnt really have time to write a whole thing. He replies with is this all you have to say, we have nothing further to talk about, night. And then iwaslike ??? Another think to keep in mind is im pretty dense and gullible and slow so im usually extremely clueless, lets not forget to add the fact i have social anxiety so my social skills in level -10. Im confused, i dont understand if he doesnt want to play with me or doesnt want to play with other ppl. This new guy i was playing with i had no qualms with, sure he can be a bit toxic but who isnt in game? and i dont understand why he reacted that way. So i reply with basically im not sure what to say, i dont know if i did anything, you know im really clueless to signs and i apoligise if i did anything. He replies with it really went over your head huh? And I'm like bruh. He then says its fine, if you ever understand it, ill be here, until then goodbye. I reply with like you said i dont understand, im sorry. Goodbye.

im starting to suspect he didnt like it when i started invited other ppl to the lobby but why???. But he never really said anything about it. Me being the dense idiot that can't pick up signs doesnt know jack about anything.

I am SERIOusly confused. Any advice on how i fucked up and how to patch it back together?"|AngelAsLan|False|https://redd.it/ekrsm8|5|1.0|0|9|1|relationship_advice
ektzd0|2020-01-06 13:12:41|Girlfriend actually crazy (claiming suicide if I break up with her)|"So my girlfriend of 7 months is making my life miserable. We started dating and everything was cool at first. The first incident came after about a month, we got into an argument, I don’t even remember what about. But I was gonna leave her house and I started getting dressed and she’s pleading with me not to go and I told her I’m leaving I’ll talk to you tomorrow so she decides to sit in front of her door with her back leaning on the door and refuses to let me leave. I got really freaked out by this and eventually gave in and went to sleep. 

I’ve broken up with her about 4 times and every time she’s threatened to kill herself which makes me reconsider and get scared and stay with her. She lies a lot about her past. Her mom tells me the truth unknowingly that I’m thinking oh your daughter lied about that. The truth is I’m just not happy with her and I don’t like her personality. I don’t ever feel excited to see her and I just don’t want to be with her. So recently I found out from her friend who she was having problems with told me that a few months ago when my girlfriend told me her other friend killed herself..... that it was a big lie and all for attention. To which my gf admitted this. I completely lost it and told her I’m done. She calls me and sends me a hundred messages to which I don’t answer or reply. She starts saying I’m going to kill myself, this time I thought “she’s just threatening, she won’t do it” welp, she ends up swallowing a handful of Benadryl, goes to the emergency room and her mom begs me to come see her when she gets home. I tell her mom about the lies, she confirms their all lies and still begs me to come see her. I go see her and she starts begging and I eventually give in. I don’t want her to die and I think she will do it again. So I’m so fuckn frustrated and don’t know what to do. I do not enjoy her company and I don’t want to be with her."|Djbiiggs|False|https://redd.it/ektzd0|0|0.71|0|30|1|relationship_advice

He’d play songs for me and make cute videos of us. He was my best friend. We would talk everyday for hours until he went on vacation. When he was on vacation, I started having problems with my family and I started to not text as much. I wouldn’t start conversations and my texts would be dry. So, he started called me out on it and questioned if I really loved him because I wasn’t putting as much effort. We fought and fought. He said he’d be there for me through thick and thin but he said I wasn’t as loving as before and that hurt me and I felt I wasn’t enough. So, I broke up with him. After like a day, he texted me saying sorry and how he loves me and that he won’t hurt me again. He wrote a song and made me this cute card but I guess I fell out of love.

ekrqrn|2020-01-06 09:22:51|How can I help my god daughter who's mental condition is spiraling partly I think cuz her mom cant grasp how her reactions hurt her kid.|"My god daughter is having probably the worst year of her life. Between her parent's divorce, hitting puberty, changing schools to the highschool, changing houses multiple times, her being the ""weird kid"" and both her parents having to deal with serious mental issues of their own she has had all sorts of insane stuff to deal with.  
Also she is learning her sexuality and has a girlfriend shes afraid to tell her dad about who's parents dont know cuz they are afraid it won't go well. She has expressed to me a fear that her not being straight will make her grandparents hate her (they are pastors in a very traditional church, bordering on a cult and already make comments about how her mom is living with a guy and not married and they need to get married right away or else)  
Oh also I am unsure if she knows for sure but she does eavesdrop so I assume she knows her dad raped her mom.  
This is a small bit of what I can think of and know.  


She also is wanting to get a job to help her mom support her family and feels guilty for doing things like eating and refuses to stand up for what she wants.

She has started to word for word mimic her mom's actions when she is off her meds, in the past year she has turned from a kid who was out going and loved hanging out with people to a kid who hides in her privacy cube she made around her bed and even doesnt wanna play D&D (her favorite game) cuz ""Just pretending to talk to people I don't know is as scary as doing it for real""   


I am unsure how much of it is her being a teenager or how much is mental illness stemming from this insane stuff if I am honest but there is a lot of the mental stress there and signs of illness. She has panic attacks where she becomes non verbal and curls into a ball. If you touch her she recoils and she has asked many times to not touch her when she is having a panic attack.

She refuses to go to see a therapist or entertain the idea of medicine or even talk to the school counselor. She talks to me and her mom some times but I think we are not enough. Until recently the approach with all the people in her life is to just be supportive and open to help and every now and then we will talk to her about positive things we have accomplished with therapy. We all try to be as open as possible so she has as mush support as possible.  


But recently her mom found out that she also copes by balling her fists to dig her fingers into her hands. That prompted mom to talk to the doctor she has to see tomorrow and tell them shes self harming and she is forcing her to go talk about this with the medical doctor. This all happened earlier this week and the appointment is tomorrow.  
 Having been a person who self harmed in the past I am freaking the hell out about the forcing thing. I know exactly what would have happened if it were me and she is already swearing she is gonna get on the bus (which comes before her mom usually is up) so she doesnt have to go.  


So tonight we are hanging out (they live above us so we are at each other's place all the time) with her on the kitchen floor sitting cuz well it amuses her and her mom's boyfriend started telling her about his experiences being locked in a mental hospital early last year and I am behind him making the cut across the throat signal as I can see her start to clench up and close in.  
I changed the subject a bit to how if you dont work well with the therapist you can get a different one till you feel comfortable and she can be in control to counter act the whole story and she was a lil better but then the boyfriend got talking again and she was getting worse, then her mom came in and was frantic saying how when she sees her daughter balling on the ground it hurts her and she cant deal with it and all this stuff about how horrible it is for mom. At this point the poor girl is in a ball on the ground as small as she can. Mom says she loves her and the boyfriend did something that seriously upsets me but everyone else seems to think is not a big deal (I have not talked to my god daughter so I donno what her thoughts are on it) he said word for word ""I know you dont want to be touched but I am gonna anyways"" and pats her head as she sits there in a ball and flinches and he says ""we are all here for you""  


I walked away to calm down and talked to her mom about it and her mom doesnt seem to get any of it. I guess she did get on her BF about that but I am very worried as that IMO is a red flag for some disturbing issues.  


I tried to explain that when she was freaking out that even though she is doing it cuz she is worried and cares it is making it worse and that it cant be about her cuz you can assume anyone who has self esteem issues will take it as bad as it can be. Her response was that she knew that it was making her feel bad but she had to finish her thought, then she left her alone.  


I feel like I am taking crazy pills today and am really worried as I have been down this road and struggle with mental shit myself and I think everyone around her is making things so much worse.  


Can you guys give me some sort of advice as to how to help my god daughter, how to get through to her mom who really cares but like can not grasp the concept that her reactions are probably a large part of the kid's issues."|ScaredandHelpless13|False|https://redd.it/ekrqrn|3|1.0|0|0|1|relationship_advice
ekwq23|2020-01-06 16:54:04|Very confusing post breakup situation|"Me (M37) and my ex gf (F32) broke up before Christmas efter 3 years together (2 years LDR). I've been in many relationships, short and long, hooked up with a lot of girls but this girl is by far the most unique and perfect one in my eyes. She is different from my previous gfs in many way and we complement each other. Family is very important for both of us and that was a perfect match as well in both directions.

&#x200B;

**Short background:**

Cultural differences, communication issues, trust issues partly valid but mostly because of misunderstandings led us from being a super great couple to me becoming insecure, needy and she pulling away. We broke up and things changed in a drastical way.  


**Long background:**

When she moved here from her home country I had been working too much, leading to occupational fatique. I got on sick leave for months which led me to become depressed and negative. I've suffered from depressive episodes earlier in my life and have been working a lot with this. My ex had never experienced depression and didn't understand how I could be like this. This guy who previously was so adventerous, funny, outgoing, half crazy was now a boring person who wasn't willing to take fun initiatives anymore, join parties and mostly wanted to stay home.

The doctors found out that I suffered from ADD which was the reason for most of my issues. Got medication and turned 360 in no time. Got a new job and felt better than in a long, long time. But before this I found out she had been thinking about leaving me, and I found a letter indicating she had a crush at someone. I got desperate and checked her computer finding out she had a crush on a workmate and also tried to get in contact with him on WhatsApp. Me and my ex had planned a camping trip and she had asked him to join ""her camping trip"". I approached her and she admitted, but said it meant nothing and was only some silly crush. Here is where the trust issues started.

Thing went good again but this seed on insecurity was planted in me and showed it's ugly face from time to time. But again, we were in a good place again and I got more social than ever (she is super social). However, we started this silly arguing about something and it got worse. Our sex life was affected and she was more and more on her phone while being home. I should have joined a party with her friends but didn't, and after this I realized she was different. She wasn't irritated that I didn't join but more happy in herself. She wouldn't tell me why and this doubt in me grew and I checked her phone this time (stupid I know). Found out she had met some guy and was almost cheating on me, dancing all night, hugging him and more stuff before telling she had a bf.

This of course made everything even worse. Her spending time on her phone, started to buy new clothes and going to gym all of sudden AND asked me if I could think about trying out an open relationship. Neither of us are (believe it or not) jealous persons we had talked about bringing in other people in our sex life before. For me I have no problem with her having sex with others and because I have a huge libido and our sex life had got worse I was thinking about having sex with others too - of course not by cheating but again talking about open relationship. But this thing with the guy was something else because she expressed having these feelings of almost a crush with this guy on the club. Sex is one thing but feelings involved is a big no no. We talked about cheating in general and I asked if she could cheat on me, and she replied ""well, I don't think so but you never know which situation will occur"".

This of course led to more suspiousness and she was not at all willing to communicate. I got more needy and she pulled back, and it was a slippery slope. She said this won't work because I was not trusting her and annoyed by her on the phone all the time. We tried again, but because we never discussed the problem we kept falling back in the same situation again until we finally broke up. This time it was mutual and she finally discussed everything and it was all misunderstandings. She had not talked with any guy on her phone, only friends. She had not planning to find someone else but wanted to really be with me. We had an emotional night and finally she expressed true emotions and that she really loves me. She wanted us to stay together but because of all this we couldn't now.

&#x200B;

**Today:**

Three weeks post breakup. We were away from each other for one week after breakup and I drastically changed. Instead of dwelling, begging and showing insecurities I have been doing the opposite from how I've felt. I have starting hanging out with a lot of new cool people, got quite popular and several girls have shown interest. My self esteem is better than ever and me knowing I could handle this situation this good has just boosted me into being more confident than ever.

We will live together for a month from now, then I will get out travel solo for a month to have fun, work on myself and get perspective. After I come back we will stay together for 3-4 more weeks til she'll move into her new flat (where we were supposed to move together). We sleep in the same bed and cuddle like we were a couple which is of course really strange  but okey from both sides. We have sex sometimes too. Both has started to use Tinder and I plan to go on my first date quite soon, just for some casual thing. Neither of us plan to get involved in some other relationships. She has been on a date but told me she realized she don't want to do dating serious because she loves me too much still.

She has change the way she looks at me alot lately. Because I've become so confident, taking this so good and not letting this affect me in the way she thought it should. She has become more and more cuddly and we are doing more and more fun stuff together, laughing and having fun. No fights, no jealousy at all anymore, no trust issues, no problems at all. I have no trouble with her chatting with other guys or dating them for that matter. I don't expect us to get back together and have realized my value because being so successful while being out and on these dating sites. But we love each other still and she said the other day that maybe we could see what happens later on after my trip and after we've been dating others for awhile. If we get together again we should do everything right, get married instantly and buy a new flat and so on.

I know you guys will say to move on and just forget about us coming back together, but this is a special situation. That seed of insecurity that grew into a plant eventually died. We have solved our issues, finally understanding each other. Both need time apart but giving we have this deep love and this unique match and all neither of us want to throw that possibility away completely. I know it sound crazy and all but again... we are not the Average Joe people anyway.

ekwolk|2020-01-06 16:51:04|I (20M) am going crazy over my best friend (20F)|"This is hardly an original situation and I probably already know what my choices are but I haven’t been able to share this with anyone and want at least an outside perspective. This is also a throwaway because she knows my account.

We knew each other for 13 years at this point, and have been friends for most of that time. Over the course of my life I’ve constantly had many small crushes on many different people, but due to being an extremely introverted person on top of being a teenager I didn’t pursue them because I was afraid or just thought they would go over quickly. And they always did, so I tried to do the same around 4 years ago when I developed a crush on her. It was okay for the first 2 years because I was focused on studying and other things, and honestly didn’t think about it that much, but over the last 2 years we’ve gotten much closer to the point of becoming not just best friends but most trusted people in our lives. Obviously due to this the crush has now become full blown feelings which I realized sometime a year ago, and despite my best efforts to ignore it like I did in the past this has just become unbearable which is why I’m here. I know I’m probably too young to determine this kind of thing but I have a hard time imagining me being comfortable pursuing a serious relationship with anyone else for the upcoming decade if it won’t work out with her, because I build relationships very slowly.

While it may seem like a no brainer to confess, I’m afraid of scaring her away because both of us have never been in a relationship, despite her saying that unless I want to cut ties with her myself she will never be too angry at me for anything because she knows who I am and I would never mean to offend her. I’m also afraid of her feeling bad because she knows something is deeply troubling me, she is my best friend after all, but admitting she was the reason might make her feel like she did something wrong, I know her and this is a possibility. I’ve never been put in any friendzone of sorts by her, nor has any of us disproved a possibility of a relationship in the past (although we never talked about it from what I remember, maybe a long time ago) and I know in a lot of ways she shows way more affection for me than anyone else but my brain just can’t read if it’s because she likes me or this is just her being comfortable with me. Another thing that fuels my fears is that she shows me much less attention than I do, and while I realistically know this is because she is a much busier person with a much bigger amount of people she keeps in touch with, it doesn’t help me feel better or any less jealous about her spending time with someone else which I try to suppress as much as possible. She still does talk with me more than anyone but I can’t help how I feel.

There is another concern I have however. Call it a hunch but I suspect her possibly  being a lesbian. Due to her being in a mostly Christian family and us not living in America (this is much less accepted here although not absent) I can easily imagine why she haven’t told me but it also makes it impossible to ask her under a normal circumstances, and if she will admit to being one if I confess I fear I may hurt her about her secret if I myself will not take the rejection well. Honestly I have just as many reasons if not more to believe she isn’t one or possibly even a bisexual, but I can’t make myself not fear the worst.


I feel like I have more chances than ever did or will to do this, but I can’t help but feel like I can’t avoid failing nonetheless. I don’t think at this point I can avoid confessing, at least because keeping a person like her in the dark is just unfair to her on the basis of how close we are. Maybe I should share this with other mutual close friends or some professional, I have people I trust, but I'm not sure how comfortable I am with that. I would take any possible advice, and possible instructions on how to approach this when talking with her. If there is any progress in the near future I might make an update post.

TL;DR: have feelings for an old friend who i've gotten extremely close over the last years, have reasons to believe confessing is both a good and a bad idea despite her saying that she won't hold a grudge at me for anything no matter what."|ThrowRA-BurnedBread|False|https://redd.it/ekwolk|1|1.0|0|1|1|relationship_advice

ekwmfr|2020-01-06 16:47:04|My parents (60f&m) never include me (24m) in family matters until its too late|"So as the title says, my parents are both 60. I feel, neglected for lack of better words in family matters. I still live at home but that's because I stuck to a crappy part time job for too long and it will hopefully change this year as moving out is my 2020 goal and have a new full time job, I just need to wait until its official 'open for business'.

Not going to lie, a lot of my frustration about this happened recently when we sent a group package to my brother (30m) out of state for his Christmas gifts. It got lost in the mail and my mom filed for insurance but ONLY her gifts. So essentially I lost $75 dollars as I bought him Red Dead Redemption 2 and a Xbox one game pass for 1 month and my mom won't pay me back. To be fair I never asked but money is a big hush hush thing in my family and asking for money, even if you deserve too, is frowned upon. She never asked me how much my gifts cost until well after it was way to late to ask the post office for a refund and at the same time was when she told me that the package went missing.   


This situation reminds me of something my mom does to me often where on, say, a Thursday night she asks me what my work is for the weekend and says ""Oh thats too bad because we were going to x and y etc. We'll bring you dinner"" when I told her time and time again that I need a 2 week notice to request the night off. One time even planning a entire vacation out of state to Chicago with my dad and not telling me until literally 3 days before they were leaving. 

My mom is not a spur of the moment type of woman. She likes to plan and she is also a introvert like me. Its mostly my neighbors that make these plans with her.

I worry this will effect my new job as she is helping the factory I will be working at to open with the boss. I ask her what date it will be open and she actually gets mad at me and tells me a vague date (ie. ""I don't know. Maybe mid January""). I told her I only want to know so I can give a 2 week more notice to my current job. I worry if I don't ask for updates she won't tell me until its too late to put in a notice and be forced to quit without one, essentially messing up my career credit. 

How do I convince my mom she NEEDS to include me in activities that will specifically include me or events I'm invited too? Especially when it should be easy too as I live at home.

Edit: some people were not understanding. I did not mean EVERY event. Trust me, I don't want to go to every thing with my parents. I specifically meant they don't tell me anything about the ones they do intend to invite me too.

Also I was applying for other jobs before I got the opportunity at this factory and still look for better offers. I ask my mom anything about our boss and she cuts me off. ""I'm handling it. I don't know anything be patient""

I ask to get in contact with him and she cuts me off again ""he's not ready yet, I'll tell you when I know""

She never gives me any information more than ""I don't know"""|frodofox|False|https://redd.it/ekwmfr|0|0.5|0|6|1|relationship_advice
ekturk|2020-01-06 13:00:44|Getting out of rut withor without my husband|"My husband has always had an anger issue, misdirected no less, very sensitive and egotistical. He also denies all those things vehemently which is laughable. His father is a totally messed up guy who has try helped him achieve the dysfunction he is capable of today. 

My husbands mom was the one beacon of light in his life outside me and she was the nicest person. She died suddenly at 62 in april. My husband and his dad got in a huge fight morning of the visitation bc his crazy father snapped at him for leaving a corkscrew out and polishing his dress shoe with a nice washcloth, and the guy kicked us out (we were staying with him in his town. so we got a hotel room). Its sad that the grandparents house we used to go visit and stay with and granny had little beds set up for the boys and everything suddenly was this cold place where the control freak asshole was willing to berate his son and scare the grandkids and told to get the hell out or hes calling the cops.

anyway my hisband lost his job shortly thereafter. It was a failing company and he was misled on the amount of opportunity. and he left a really really good and stable job to do tha one. so here he is with fresh woulds from his dad, a mom that just died no job and he was very fixated on the idea that he was stupid to “throw away” the job before it for something so risky. he turned into an enormous jerk. not just someone who has bad days but hateful to me through and through. and of course the sex dropped off to pretty much nothing bc how can i be intimate with someone so nasty to me? and so then he blamed the lack of sex among everything else.

i had also been dealing with my dad being diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer in february and by the time we came back from MILs funeral and my husband was unemployed, my dads clinical trial meds kind of made this go haywire and for a month he was in an assisted care home unaware of who i even was. it was like ivernight i lost my stability, my marriage, my dad my mother in law (who i admittedly loved eveb more than my own mother) and my FIL who i always got along ok with but now kinda hated. I was def depressed too and 2019 was the first year i didnt workout once when i used to be very active and a dancer and also cheered/danced for a professional sports team in my 20s. Now i walked around with an elephant on my chest.i also had a super stressful year at work but i did well (how i dont know) and got a big bonus at christmas. that was the one good thing.

We managed a precarious relationship with my FIL. my dads meds were stabilized and luckily for now, the 10% chance he had of the cancer respndin to the treatment at all, worked, so hes been doing well. day after christmas i got into a bug argument w my FIL. ive literally bever called him in his shit in ten years but id had enough and it didbt go well. my husband said he understod completely and is on ny side byt the renewed conflict sent him ibto a depression. he laid in bed and did nothing from the 27th to the 29th. Then he got iut of bed but was completely mean and nasty and depressive as hell and just verbaly abusive af and everything 30th to 1st. i think even though he is on my side w the figt w his dad i thibk his dad is toxic and can bring him into a depression. my BIL and i talked abd he said he wouldnt blame me if i decided to cut off the FIL for the sake of anyone. The only people my FIL is really ok with now is my grandsons vut hed f that up eventually im sure

So now im trying to decide what to do for the sale of myself, my husband and our family. I have staryed working out again and eating better again (i gained ten pounds on accou t of last year(and trying to feel a renewed sense of hope. I told my husband after our one fight that im probably taking a trip to europe with my brother in the summer. kids are too young to travel and i cant wait on him. so ill go with my brother. 

i dont want to be estranged from my FIL but im thibking qe may at least need to take another long break from the guy. He affects my husband too much. and me. 

I am just hoping i can crawl out of my own depression and maybe my husband will get better. i almost had this weird sense of uneasiness in the air when i woke up early the past two mornings and workwd out in our basement - like he seemed quiet on the topic. I dont want to leave my husband behind but emotionally i need to help myself. my husband does nothing to help himself. he stares at his phone and drinks a little too often and never exercises and is cynical and negative and quick to temper and denies everything about himself that isnt perfect. he started a new job in october so hopefully that goes well and gives him a renewed sense of purpose. i am going to keep going to therapy and help my dad when i can, work hard at work abd maybe get back in shape for myself. ill go to europe with my brother. i just have to figure out what to do with my husband and his family dynamic. i hope we are better this year ifnot next year at least. walking around worrying if your marriage is sustainable, on top of everything else, is no way to live.

ekwkgj|2020-01-06 16:43:09|Long distance relationship with ex, is it possible?|I was dating my boyfriend for about 3 years. He broke up with me in September because he needed to figure out what he was doing with his life and he didn’t want to pull me down with him any longer. When we were together he failed out of college and he struggled with trying to find out what he was going to do in the future. When he broke up with me, I was heart broken but I distanced myself and we didn’t talk. In December he moved down to Georgia to be with family. I have been dating other people in the meantime but, honestly no one has made me feel the way he did. Now, he has been reaching out to me and telling me how much he feels like he made a mistake. He’s been telling me how he thinks about me in everything he does and how he is getting his life together. He recently started his new career. He said he wants to come back up to Wisconsin soon, and he wants to see me face to face so that he can explain everything. He said he wants me to seriously think about what I want from my future because he wants to try to fix things. I still love him very much, but I still have a year left of college and I don’t know if making a long distance relationship work after he broke my heart is possible. I have conflicting feelings about the whole situation because at the end of the day, I do feel like he’s the person I want to spend the rest of my life with but I don’t know if it would be wise to move to another state with him after graduation since he just broke my heart. How can I be smart and make wise decisions about this current situation?|sweettooth9828|False|https://redd.it/ekwkgj|0|0.5|0|2|1|relationship_advice
ekqytb|2020-01-06 07:58:23|Emotionally abusive bf... what to do?|"Here’s some backstory: So I have been with my bf for about 2 years, but only one officially. Right when we first started talking, he messed around w someone else and it made me have trust issues. But about 3 months in, he started getting abusive. Saying that he didn’t like my friends or whenever I drank (never in excess). He did like that I liked going out with my friends and going to get-togethers, which ultimately resulted in him forcing me to cut them off (he now gaslights me and says he never did this). The whole reason I put off becoming official was because I stupidly thought he would change. In December of last year, I asked him to my bf not because I necessarily wanted to, but because I thought if I did his behavior towards me would change now that I was his. It did not and hasn’t.

He berates me for being bi, saying that anyone I’m with other than him must be my other bf/gf. He accuses me of cheating on him every chance he gets, and again gaslights me when I attempt to defend myself (you wouldn’t need to defend yourself if you weren’t cheating). I find this ironic bc I have messaged his ex gf, and he cheated on her as well as the girl before her (all he fold me was that he “messed things up (gf #1) and “she randomly decided she didn’t want me anymore”(gf #2). He says that I am stupid when I don’t understand something and how annoying I am because of my past trauma. When I try to communicate how I am feeling or things that I feel hurt that he is doing, he never recognizes it - just questions it “are you sure you’re not blowing that out of context?” He blames me for people not wanting to be his friend, when I am not the only one he treats like shit. He even knows that he is abusive but continues to do it. 

I want to leave this relationship but he is the type to get revenge and the thought of that is terrifying to me. He has stalked past girlfriends and friends, I can’t handle that happening to me. I cut off toxic family members last year and they’re still stalking me, I can’t handle another person doing it. Recently he told me “I know so much about you that if you ever tried anything? I could surely ruin your life.” 

Does anyone have any advice? Thanks for reading...."|gentillefemme|False|https://redd.it/ekqytb|4|0.84|0|7|1|relationship_advice
ekqek9|2020-01-06 06:58:35|Why do I need constant love? Toxic relationship pattern and I don’t know if I can truly love. What does this mean?|"I’m 18(F) and I seem to keep falling in patterns. Whenever I feel I love someone, I love them when I’m with them, but the second I’m not with them for a little while I need the attention. I usually get a good amount, and it becomes impossible for me not to accept it. I get confused and don’t know who I like more because I will usually have two people crazy about me at once. This has happened multiple times. I’m usually happy with the new person (I’ll date the one then after a few months leave them for the other person) and I tend to be happy with my decision. However, this KEEPS happening and I’m scared that I’ll never be happy because I’m always accepting attention. Now I finally have someone who gives me tons of attention and I feel like I can be honest about my issues with and he still accepts me. He is weary of it and will question me in a very respectful way if I seem sketchy. Especially being in college, the distance is hard. We will be meeting every month but I still worry I’ll start doubting his love for me and will not trust. 
Do I love the person, or do I just love being loved? I’ve never been picky and I love anyone who gives me attention and I fall for them quickly. I will develop an emotional and physical attraction that seems so real that I don’t know what else it could be. Usually they will also be a crush, but it develops insanely fast once they give me attention. 
Please help me understand what this means and what I can do."|areukittenme_|False|https://redd.it/ekqek9|5|0.68|0|5|1|relationship_advice
ekshg5|2020-01-06 10:44:03|I (M20) can't stop being jealous and getting mad at my girlfriend (F18)|"So about 6 months ago my girlfriend went on a trip and on that trip she, well, became a little intimate with some people. She flashed herself infront of 2 boys and then later on kissed on of them. She fooled around with her best girlfriend (which I am normally not against) infront of some guys at the club. Also I believe she is hiding something else since she keep changing her story on what happened there. 

Anyways, I got super sad and it felt like a train had hit my chest. I decided to try continuing our relationship because she seemed pretty regretting about what she had done and I thought that she at least didn't have sex with someone. But as time passes, the feeling of inadequacy doesn't seem to go away and especially as she keeps telling me about her having romantic dreams about other guys. I feel so broken and whenever I get mad or jealous of her I just disappear from the world for a while until I calm down. I have always seen my girlfriend as very innocent and the nicest person in the world, but sometimes I feel like she is playing with my emotions. 

Is my reaction to her actions normal? I really don't want to be over-controlling and so but maybe I am overreacting here. What do you guys think?

I would be more than happy for any advice you give:)"|throwRAlalada|False|https://redd.it/ekshg5|3|0.81|0|4|1|relationship_advice

I’ve pretty much tried doing it in every relationship that looked like it wasn’t going to work and nothing bad happened but have never remotely even come close to trying it. Practically it seems like the thing to do if you’re still attracted to each other but realized you don’t work well in a relationship."|tivosss|False|https://redd.it/ekwgdj|0|0.4|0|2|1|relationship_advice
