“The jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn’t getting any younger and I wanted to settle down.

I uncovered some incredible dealings there and was awarded a batch of medals. Had a wife, a mess of puppies, and now I’m just retired.”

ekvdjl|2020-01-06 15:13:05|Fancy Chicago lawyer goes duck hunting in LA (Lower Alabama) (very long)|"This lawyer had  heard about the exceptional duck hunting in lower Alabama so he made plans to go one year. He left his hotel early and found a good spot by sun-up. He had the most expensive equipment money could buy.

He missed a few ducks, but then shot one. It flapped a couple times and landed across a fence in a field. He started to cross the fence to get it when a farmer pulled up on his tractor.

""Whoa there, buddy. You can't come onto my land.""

The lawyer said, ""Of course I can. That duck belongs to me and I have every right to retrieve it.""

Farmer Brown said, ""Nope, it's on my property, that makes it *mine*.""

The lawyer immediately got pissed and told him, ""I'll have you know that I'm one of the best lawyers, not only in Chicago, but in the entire state of Illinois. If you do not allow me to get my property I'll sue you and end up owning everything you have to your name!""

The farmer said, ""Slow down, buddy, it's just a duck. We usually settle petty arguments like this around here with the 'three kick rule,' if you wanna try that.""

Lawyer said, ""What's the three kick rule?""

Farmer said, ""That's where we take turns kicking each other three times, then the other person gets three kicks. The one who gives up first loses.""

The lawyer looked at farmer Brown. He thought to himself, ""I go to the gym three times a week, I jog nearly every day, I keep in shape. There's no way this fat old Alabama bastard can beat me at anything physical.""

The lawyer said, ""That sounds fine to me, I'll do it.""

Farmer said, ""Ok. Since it's on my property, I get to kick first.""

The lawyer braced himself.

That farmer reared back his size 12 steel-toed work boot and planted it directly in that lawyer's nuts, giving his family jewels a shock he'd never thought possible. The lawyer dropped to his knees in immediate agony.

The farmer's second kick went right to the lawyer's stomach, and everything inside him came up in a surging stream of regurgitation.

Then the farmer strolled around behind him and kicked him in his ass so hard the lawyer fell face-first into the puddle of his own vomitus, spittle and tears.

That lawyer lay, gasping for breath, for several minutes before he could move. He shakily managed to get to his feet. He wiped the slobber off his face with his sleeve and glared at that farmer until he finally struggled to speak, almost in a whisper:

""Now it's *my* turn.""

The farmer looked him in the eye and smiled as he got on his tractor. ""Nah, I give up. You can have the duck."""|filmcup|False|https://redd.it/ekvdjl|5|0.86|0|0|1|jokes

Harry, probably already three sheets to the wind, replies, ""You know officer, I would give you that, but this is a stolen car."" The cop is a bit taken aback and asks if there's anything else Caray needs to tell him. ""As a matter of fact, I've got an unlicensed weapon in the glove compartment."" The cop is starting to get worried and asks Caray to step out of the vehicle. Harry does and tells him ""By the way, there's a dead body in the trunk, too."" The cop is frazzled and tells him he has to call in backup to help search the car.

As they're doing so, the backup officer turns to him and says, ""Mr. Caray, my partner said you told him this car is stolen, you've got a weapon in the glove compartment and a dead body in the trunk, and none of that is true.""

Caray then says: ""And I bet that son-of-a-bitch is going to say I was speeding, too!""

Smoke began to swirl from the end of the lamp, and coalesced into a muscular man in old Arabian attire.

""I am a jinn who has been trapped inside this lamp!"" the being bellowed, ""For freeing me, I will grant you three wishes.""

The jinn pondered for a moment, then spoke.

""Fine, I witnessed the theft from inside the lamp, but the rules tend to favor the one who actually rubs the lamp. But, seeing as how it was a real dick move,  I have decided on a solution that may be equitable.""

""I will grant the one who found the lamp the three wishes, and the one who stole the lamp will be given the exact same wishes that are requested...but the effects or amounts will be doubled, since he actually rubbed the lamp and freed me.""

""I want 100 tons of diamonds and gold!!!""

eknj6u|2020-01-06 02:44:07|My favorite Finnish joke|"Pekka is at a party in a tall building in the great city of Helsinki, which is quite different from the small timber cabin in the forest he is used to as a lumberjack. Pekka is enjoying the party, but after a few bottles of the moonshine he brought, Pekka finds himself in the need of a toilet. He asks the hostess where the toilet might be located. She notices he’s a bit drunk, so she points and explains very carefully:

“Go out in the hall there, take the second door on your right, and be careful, there are three steps down, and there you’ll find the toilet.”

Pekka thanks the lady as politely as he can, and wanders off in the opposite direction. He finds a door, slams it open, and walks straight in without a care in the world, and finds himself tumbling down 17 meters in an empty elevator shaft. A bit confused after the fall, he stands up, brushes some dust off his shirt, and exclaims:

“Pärkälä! I’ll pee here! I can’t be bothered with two more steps like that!”

The devil says that there are 3 other people here that have done less bad than Trump, so Trump gets to decide which one goes to heaven so he can take their place.

The devil opens 3 doors, the first door has Richard Nixon in it. Nixon is swimming around a big pool nonstop.

The devil asked Trump if he would like to take Nixon's place.

Trump declined, and said that he was not a very good swimmer, and would get tired way to quickly.

The devil moves on, and opens the second door. Inside this room is Andrew Jackson. Andrew Jackson was running on the treadmill for eternity. The devil once again asked Trump if he would like to take his place.

""NO WAY""!, said Trump. ""I get very dehydrated and my ankles swell up when I run, even if I run for 1 minute"".

So, the devil led Trump to the last room. Inside this room was Bill Clinton, sitting on a chair, arms over his head, legs spread eagle. Also in the room was Melania Trump, sucking Bill Clinton real good.

The devil asked Trump one more time which room he choses, and who he would like to take the place of.

Trump, without hesitation, choses room #3.

A short time later, a dog trotted up to the window, saw the sign, and went inside.
After going inside, the dog looked at the receptionist and wagged his tail, then he walked over to the sign, looked at it, and whined. The receptionist got the idea and told the office manager. The office manager looked at the dog and was surprised, to say the least. However, the dog looked determined, so the manager led the dog into his office. 

Inside, the dog jumped up onto a chair and started patiently staring at the manager. The manager said, “I can’t hire you. The sign says that you have to be able to type.”  The dog jumped down, walked over to a computer and typed out a perfect letter and then signed his name. The manager was stunned but then told the dog, “I still can’t hire you. The sign says that you have to be good with computers too.” The dog then went over to the computer and typed up a program that ran perfectly on the first test.
By now, the manager was totally dumbfounded and said to the dog, “I realize that you are a very intelligent dog and you have some interesting skills. However, I still can’t give you the job.” 
The dog jumped down and walked over to the sign and put his paw on the part where it said ‘equal opportunity employer’.

The manager said, “Yes, but the sign also says that you have to be bilingual.”

Old mate was on a plane, pleased with himself because he was in First Class, when he noticed a bit of a kerfuffle near the doorway. The plane had been delayed a little which added to the curiosity so he is rubber necking a bit when he sees a big hat makes it’s way through the portal. He is astounded to see that attached to the hat is His Holiness, The Pope. 

Not being at all religious old mate is a bit shocked at how much he is Fan-Boying inside, but he resolves to keep it in and be on his best behaviour. 

His Holiness sits down beside the man and they politely greet each other while the plane taxies. After it takes off the pope opens up a crosswords book and starts working through one. It causes him much frowning and muttering under his breath and eventually he asks old mate “*Excuse me my son but perhaps you can help me, pertaining to the female, four letters ending in unt*.”

Now old mate is normally a bit coarse but he’s on his best behavior so instead of providing The Pope with an answer he politely declines. 

About an hour later out of nowhere he starts and says “*Oh, your Holiness. Aunt*!”

His Holiness looks down at his crossword, sucks in air between his teeth and says “*oh. Right. Do you have an eraser?”*"|tiranamisu|False|https://redd.it/ekri0s|3|0.81|0|1|1|jokes

ekno9g|2020-01-06 02:55:05|A new twist on The Monk Joke|"A man is driving down the road one day when his car breaks down in front of a monastery. He goes up to the monastery and before he can even ask for help, the monks invite him in, they feed him a delicious dinner, they let him sleep the night, and in the morning, before breakfast, they inform him that they fixed his car overnight. 

But during the night, the man had heard a strange noise coming from deep within the monastery. The noise was beautiful and yet haunting— once he had heard it, he knew he wouldn’t be able to get it out of his head. And the man could not begin to identify in his mind what was making the noise. So in the morning, over breakfast, the man asks the monks:

“Hey, what was making that sound from within the monastery?”

“We’re very sorry,” they reply, “we cannot tell you, because you’re not a monk.”

After a moment of pause the man accepts this. “Well, fair enough, I guess. Thank you so much for everything you’ve done for me.” And, after the monks refuse to accept any form of payment for their hospitality, the man leaves. 

One year later, to the day, the same man, driving the same car, at the same time of night, breaks down in front of the same monastery.

Everything happens as it had the year before. The monks invite him in, feed him, let him spend the night, fix the car, and overnight, the man hears the same sound coming from within the monastery. Hearing it again after all this time, the man now lays awake all night. It’s as if the sound is calling out to him. By the time morning comes, one thing is clear: the man will never be satisfied until he knows what the source of the sound was. 

So in the morning he asks again. And again, the monks tell him that since he is not a monk, they cannot tell him. 

“Alright,” he says, “you’ve interested me. What do I have to do to become a monk?”

“You have to go around the world,” they reply, “without using any type of vehicle that has an engine. And in your travels, you have to count the number of people you see. You do not have to count the number of people in the world— but you need to count the number of people you see, while you go around the world.”

The man sets off. He begins traveling immediately after finishing breakfast. Since he cannot use a vehicle with an engine, he figures that his best bet is to use a bicycle to travel the land distances, but the bulk of his journey would happen using a sail boat. 

He plots his course, and then navigates it. And with every person he saw, he added to his count. Every person he passed while traveling on the road. Every person in every car that passed him. All the people in the port before he set sail. All the people in the port where he landed. And so on. 

Finally, after a great deal of time spent traveling and counting people, he arrives back at the monastery. His car is still parked there. He walks right past it without casting it a second glance, and he knocks on the door of the monastery. 

“Welcome home,” a monk greets him.

“I made the journey,” the man says, “I saw Four hundred and seventy nine thousand, seven hundred and sixty two people, including you.” 

“Excellent,” says the monk, as he embraces the man and leads him into the monastery, “then you are home. You are a monk now. And as such...” the man pulls out a key which he carries on a necklace around his neck, “you can find what you sought.”

The monk hands the man the key and leads him to a wooden door. The door’s surface is worn, but strong. It has been the guardian of the source of the sound for a very long time. The man unlocks the door, and behind the door is a long hallway. Hundreds of yards long, so that it must go deep into the mountain that the monastery sits at the foot of. He begins to walk down it, then he starts to run. He’s almost there. He can hear the sound growing louder. 

At the end of the hallway is a large, steel door. The kind of door that would secure a bank vault. The monk— who the man had not heard running behind him— tells the man the combination. Turn right five times and lan in ninety one. Turn left four times, land on sixty eight. Right three times to eleven. Finally, left twice, landing on zero. 

The locking mechanism clicks and the vault door unlocks. The man turns the handle and pulls back, revealing another, darker hallway. Halfway down this hallway, it opens up into a cavern. But through the cavern, there is a well lit and well worn path— worn by the feet of all those who have seen the source of the sound. The sound, which was growing louder with ever step. He was so close. 

The man arrives at the end of the path. There was a round stone door— similar to the type of door that sealed Jesus’ tomb. The man goes to one side of the door and pushes with all the strength he has left just to make the door budge, but once he has it rolls the rest of the way to the side. 

Exhausted, the man now staggers into yet another, much shorter hallway which is only about fifteen yards in length. At the end of this hallway is a curtain. The man peels the curtain to the side, and is amazed. He’s done it. He’s seen the source of the sound. 

It was a man, with red hair. He wore a suit jacket over a striped shirt. And he was singing:

Young Jean-Luc is in his newly crafted home when suddenly his friend Jean-Pierre bursts through his front door. 'Jean Luc!' he exclaims. 'You weel nevar believe! I 'ave 'eard word of a bacon tree!'. Jean-Luc looks confused and scoffs 'Imposseeble! You cannot grow BaycON on a tree!'. 'Come! And I weel show you ze bacon tree!'.

Somehow the topic of conversation wandered to the effects of cocaine and other substances on the nostrils. The attention seeker of the group, James, adamantly responded there's no way the actual activity of snorting could possibly harm your nose, and the destruction of the schnauzer was the fault of whatever substance was snorted.

Several members of the group challenged this, and back and forth ensued, until an agreement was reached. James would try it himself, without the substance part.

Issue was, the only consumable we had handy was fruit punch. The group began boiling down a small batch to be placed into a snortable less liquidy form. Credit cards were unsheathed, ready to swipe and manipulate the gooey substance into a snortable line. The scene was set and the challenge was nearing.

ekc4wt|2020-01-05 11:57:19|Let me introduce the little known tale of Curtis Remond.|"Curtis was born in the small town of New York, the only child of a rich and famous banking family. Curtis’ father was a banker. Curtis’ grandfather was a banker. The banking linage runs as far back in the family as time can remember, ever since Gerald Redmond had emigrated from Killarney back in the 1840’s to escape the potato famine ravaging the emerald isle at the time.

As such, Curtis was brought up in the so called proper way. He was sent to the prestigious Browning School for his studies, and his every need and whim was catered for by a small army of household staff, there to dress him in the morning, wash him at night and even be on hand with a tissue if he even as much as sneezed.

While young Curtis appreciated the life that his parents were trying to make for him, he slowly began to resent the pampered existence he grew up in. His father was never around, always working late in the office, while his mother was more focused on her burgeoning cosmetic business than caring for her developing offspring. While he was a bright kid, as he grew into his, his rebellious streak came to the fore. He started skipping school, instead hanging around the streets of the Big Apple with some of the more undesirable types that his parents had tried to shelter him from. He learnt about different types of upbringing, and that people can make it on their own way, and not follow the set path that their parents wanted but still be happy and successful. However, Curtis felt a little alienated by this environment, due to his upper-class upbringing, and started using the nickname “Red” in an attempt to fit in with his new social circle.

Obviously, his father was not happy with this situation. He had hoped Curtis would follow in the family tradition, and it all came to a head one Christmas Eve, which happened to be Curtis’ 16th birthday. They had a blazing row, and Curtis was thrown out of the family home. Left with nowhere to go, but he just wanted at that time to be as far away from his parents as possible, so using a credit card stolen from his father, he booked the next available flight to Anchorage, Alaska.

However, as previously mentioned, Red was a clever and personable guy. Once in Alaska, he quickly found work and lodging with the Hamilton’s, a loving family of sheep herders on the outskirts of the city. He adored this new lifestyle and the freedom he’d never before encountered in his life. He swiftly grew attached to his new venture and vowed never to return to the city from where he’d been raised.

Red also found love. Alice was the beautiful daughter of the farming family, and Alice and Red married at 18, in a small ceremony on the Hamilton’s farm. Red did invite his parents, but they didn’t even give him the courtesy of responding. The newlywed couple started their own smallholding, and Alice gave birth to their first child, who they named Kai. The new family kindled close friendships within the sheep herding community, and before long young Kai was accompany Red on his farming duties. These often extending into the twilight hours, especially in winter where daylight in Alaska is at a premium, so the majority of the time they and the other farmers were working using flashlights and head-lamps.

However, after a while Red noticed an odd phenomenon. Whenever he brought Kai out to help round up the sheep at the end of the night, the all the light sources flickered and eventually went out. They changed bulbs, put in brand new batteries, but this kept happening. No-one had known such a strange occurrence before, and there seemed to be no explanation. Obviously, this was effecting their work, and bereft of any other ideas, they turned to Fred, the oldest and longest serving farmer in the village.

After explaining the situation, Fred let out a sigh. “There is a simple reason for this”, Fred explained, “It is an old farmers adage”
