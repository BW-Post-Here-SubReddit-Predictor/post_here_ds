I'm looking to buy a USB-C hub for my new notebook.

I don't want it for stationary use, instead I'll carry it around with me and the notebook. That means it shouldn't be more than about 0.5kg (1lb) and it shouldn't need it's own charger, unless it's already included in the hub.

I've recently been looking for a decent pair of LED glasses so that I could take it apart and incorporate its parts into a DIY project, the jist being inserting the LED matrix into a ski mask to make a fancy wearable mask with cool custom LED effects. 

  
While searching for the right product to use [CHEMION LED glasses](https://www.amazon.ca/CHEMION-Customizable-Bluetooth-Festivals-Animation/dp/B01B41PHJM/ref=pd_rhf_sc_p_img_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=FKZ3EJFTPCNGX447BMAV) stood out as the clear favourite the only problem being its price at 87$ Canadian. The tipping factor is the glasses app which allows users to   
 create custom animations, a feature that I have been unable to find within cheaper alternatives.

  
Now, before I shell out 87$ for something I'm just gonna take apart, I thought to put the question out there to perhaps catch anything I may have missed."|NewguyS79|False|https://redd.it/ejpkp4|0|0.5|0|0|1|gadgets

Recently, I figured it would be nice if I could show my grandparents some pictures instead of just calling them from time to time. Unfortunately they are not tech savvy whatsoever, so a smartphone is out of the question. I found some digital photo frames online, where I could add pictures via app as soon as its set up. What I couldn't figure out yet is, if there is a frame out there that supports showing only specific pictures when I want to show them (so I could reference specific pictures while I'm on a call with them, by showing them in real time). Does anyone of you know of any such frame?  


Ideally other characteristics would be:  
\- no maintenance after setup  
\- adding and deleting of photos by multiple users via app  
\- maybe a ""sleep"" mode so it doesn't shine during night

I want a smart watch, my first one. And I am torn between the Fitbit Versa 2 or Apple Watch 3. They are both in my budget range.

I need something that I can track sleep with, monitoring heart rate is useful, see notifications from Insta, Twitter and WhatsApp, and be able to use Apple or Fitbit Pay.

Which of the two is better in your opinion? The fact I have an iPhone, will that make a difference?

I use Spotify, so I assume I can skip and replay tracks from the watch?

I lean towards the Fitbit as it has a much longer battery. But worry about the compatibility. Would the watch be able to show emojis I receive from text messages as well? As this doesn’t work with some watches.

My buddy already tried this in the past but gave up on it. I have a Raspberry Pi that I would like to use and do not have an available open slot for an HDMI on my existing monitor. I have an old Dell Inspiron 5421 that is around 7 years old and it has damage to the board. Would it be possible, and what would I need to do to turn the screen (which still works fine) into a monitor for my Raspberry Pi?

Thanks for any advice,

ehf2hd|2019-12-30 01:36:53|Windows Explorer stops responding when an old hard drive is plugged in|"Hey guys,

Alright, so the hard drive from the laptop in my previous post was taken out of the old laptop. It ran Windows 8.1 at the time. I plugged the old hard drive into a SATA cable and plugged the other end into a USB port on my new laptop that runs Windows 10. The drive will show up in Windows Explorer as ""D: Local Disk"". The drive says it has no files and when I right click and try to format it, Windows Explorer stops responding and I have to restart it from the task manager. Am I doing something wrong? Is the Windows 8.1 hard drive trying to run Windows 8 boot files while Windows 10 is running on my current PC? I am not sure what is causing the hard drive to stop Windows Explorer from accessing it. The hard drive has no obvious damage and doesn't click or make noises either. Any help would be appreciated!

I have a Dell Inspiron 7573 that came with a 256 GB SSD. There is an open hard drive slot inside the computer and I recently got a brand new HDD from my grandmother. I wanted to have both drives in so I can have extra storage. Maybe a good idea would be to put the Windows OS on the SSD and all of my other files on the HDD. Putting it in would be the easy part. However, I am not sure what I would have to do to get it running. I am green as grass when it comes to PCs and electronics so any advice for a beginner would be greatly appreciated!

ef74h0|2019-12-24 21:08:06|A Christmas present Powerbank-conundrum|"Hi r/gadgets. As the title suggests, I've got a bit of a gift-conundrum.

For Christmas this year, I got two 20.000 mAh Powerbanks for my mobile phone, as two separate members of the family had the same great idea, to expand my mobile (which I am - as they put it - glued to) 's battery life. So now, I' m trying to figure out which to keep, and which to exchange for another gadget. 

Now, the first one is a Goobay 20.0 Powerbank, which boasts three output ports, of 2.0 Amps and 5 V
A 3.7 V Lithium-Polymer Akku battery of max. 20.000 mAh

While the other is a hoco. Model: B31B
Also 20.000 mAh
Two 2.1 A, 5V USB outputs,
As well as ""ABS + PC Flame Retardent Material""
It doesn't say on the box, (and this specifik one doesn't appear on their website either) but judging from the other Powerbanks that they sell, the battery is a Lithium-ion 18650

Neither of them are brands that I'm familiar with, and apparently to me, the only difference is the battery type, but I cant really tell which is better. Are there some obvious details I'm missing? Are anyone familiar with the brands, maybe and could give some insight?

eezf58|2019-12-24 09:57:40|Question about battery life and my new phone|"Hey, 

I bought myself LG G7 from ""Allegro"", polish site with mostly(but not only) used stuff, smartphone is supposed to be new and I'm told it comes with manufacturer's guarantee. I'm mentioning all of this because my phone came 100% charged which I found quite unusual, very occasionally, mostly during unlocking, it seems to have a 0,5-1sec lag which I also find strange for a brand new phone, a plasticy packaging it was in right out of the box was also unsealed I think now that I recall to that moment(though I'm not sure so we'll never know I guess) and it had no things to peel off on it, basically, did I get scammed?

I also checked IMEI code and site said this phone is:  Device age 1 year(s) 5 month(s) 8 day(s), but I don't know if it actually means anything useful, my guess would be that it doesn't but better mention it than not

With that out of the way, I started looking for some guides how to treat a new battery, assuming that the one I have is really new, I only found tips like never discharge fully, don't charge over 80%, start charging when it drops down to 10-15%. LG's official UK site had little guide what to do and not. At the end they wrote this:

""**CALIBRATION OF THE BATTERY** 

It is recommended to calibrate the battery once every 3 months (if you often use the device). This procedure involves a fully dishcharged battery.

Use the gadget until the battery is fully discharged.

Then wait six hours and fully recharge the battery.

When the battery reaches 100%, leave the device connected to the power supply for 2 hours.

At this point the battery has been properly calibrated and the device is ready for normal use.""

ecdxuv|2019-12-18 15:19:06|Can you make the Galaxy Fold sound like a Shiekah Slate?|"It's too early for a Shiekah Slate phone cover, but ever since I saw the Fold, I wanted it to have one feature more than anything in the world. When you open it, I want it to play the sound of the [Shiekah Slate opening](https://youtu.be/2mEx18kFt5o?t=154). So how can I do this?  
Short answer: You can't right now.  
Real answer: I've called the Galaxy Fold hotline they have for new users 1800-970-3653 (1800-970-FOLD haha), and asked if they had a feature for a customizable sound that plays when you open the Fold. The guy I talked to said he couldn't find an option like that anywhere, but there was hope.   
He said that the development team is listening in on these calls for feedback on the Fold, and that he'd send over my suggestion to have a sound play when you open it. My hope is, that I'm not the only one that would want this feature, and that if enough people ask for this It'll actually be implemented.  
I'm not really one for the whole 'personal army' kinda thing, but if anyone here agrees with me, and would like to pass the suggestion as well, that would be incredibly rad.
