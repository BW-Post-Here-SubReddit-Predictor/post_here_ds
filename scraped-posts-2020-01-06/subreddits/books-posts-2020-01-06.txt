eik4bu|2020-01-01 16:27:00|The /r/books Book Club Selection for January is The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth and Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine by Thomas Morris|"From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38095085-the-mystery-of-the-exploding-teeth-and-other-curiosities-from-the-histor): 

>A mysterious epidemic of dental explosions,  
A teenage boy who got his wick stuck in a candlestick  
A remarkable woman who, like a human fountain, spurted urine from virtually every orifice  
  
>  
>These are just a few of the anecdotal gems that have until now lain undiscovered in medical journals for centuries. This fascinating collection of historical curiosities explores some of the strangest cases that have perplexed doctors across the world.  
  
>  
>From seventeenth-century Holland to Tsarist Russia, from rural Canada to a whaler in the Pacific, many are monuments to human stupidity – such as the sailor who swallowed dozens of penknives to amuse his shipmates, or the chemistry student who in 1850 arrived at a hospital in New York with his penis trapped inside a bottle, having unwisely decided to relieve himself into a vessel containing highly reactive potassium. Others demonstrate exceptional surgical ingenuity long before the advent of anaesthesia – such as a daring nineteenth-century operation to remove a metal fragment from beneath a conscious patient’s heart. We also hear of the weird, often hilarious remedies employed by physicians of yore – from crow’s vomit to port-wine enemas – the hazards of such everyday objects as cucumbers and false teeth, and miraculous recovery from apparently terminal injuries. 

After a month long hiatus we are back this month with *The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth and Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine* by Thomas Morris. Thomas will be joining us on F**riday January 31, 2020** for an AMA.

ekuwdb|2020-01-06 14:34:46|I illustrated more tiny book covers for each book I read in 2019|"In January last year, I [shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/acztox/i_illustrated_a_tiny_new_cover_for_every_book_i/) all the books I had created mini cover illustrations for every book I read for as part of a personal illustration/reading challenge, and wanted to share my books and illustrations for 2019.

For every book I read, I create a little blank book cut-out which I use as a bookmark and then, once I finish, complete a small, black and white illustration which aims to capture the essence of the story. Sometimes it's a scene, other times it's a key piece of imagery or symbolism, other times it's an unrelated image that attempts to encapsulate the ideas. Regardless of the illustration, the process has really helped me focus more while reading, allowing me to consider what the key elements were and what I got out of the narrative. It also allowed me to pause after I finished a book and not just jump into the next without letting the ideas sink in. I managed to read 34 books, the most I think i've read since I was 13 years old. Don't get me wrong, not all were good, but I took risks and discovered some absolutely incredible authors out there, including Catherynne M. Valente and Fernando A. Flores.

You can see all my new illustrations [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/XTxFUo5) and I really encourage you to attempt your own illustrations or something similar, as I've found that moment of introspection to be so valuable in understanding and appreciating a novel.

ekptkp|2020-01-06 06:01:52|For the first time in at least a decade, I read an entire book for fun!|"I know it's probably not that big of a deal, but for the first time since middle school I have actually read a book, front to back and not skipping any pages, just because I wanted to!

As a student majoring in History, I read a fairly good amount, but always because I have a report to write, or an exam to pass. Just like in elementary, middle, and high school, I never had any interest in reading since assigning texts instantly turned me off from enjoying them, regardless of whether or not they were actually good books. Just about every one that I had to read I'd end up skipping a page here and there or speedrunning the last few chapters to get it over with and complete the assignment. The last book I actually read for fun was Stephen Crane's ""The Red Badge of Courage"" four times back in 2008. This past relationship with reading still rests in the back of my mind, which is why I haven't tried reading for fun until now. I mean, I've even worked in a small book/record store for quite a while and I just couldn't get past the idea that reading is only for grades!

That was until last semester where my history professor, the man that has changed how I look at my future in so many ways already, recommended ""The Guns of The South"" by Harry Turtledove. I'll admit that it did take some time to start, but once I got going, there was no turning back. I was truly invested in a story that didn't require me to hold a controller or watch a screen. I was amazed! I set a goal that I would finish the book before my next semester started and I did it!

When I finally turned the last page and closed the book, I cried. Not only have I completed my goal, but I feel like I've reopened a lost world of knowledge and storytelling to myself."|RobotOfSociety|False|https://redd.it/ekptkp|90|0.8|1|10|1|books

I’ve also seen a film adaptation of Norwegian Wood. I was discussing him with a friend earlier, and we both agreed that he had a pretty distinct style, one that I really enjoyed, but I couldn’t quite put his way of writing into words. The way I’d personally describe his writing is it’s dreamlike, surreal, confusing and yet really emotionally charged, like those dreams that affect you deeply when you wake up. Like, you don’t remember the dream, what occurred, or what it meant, but you just know that it struck a feeling within you that you can’t quite explain.|Sans_Revel|False|https://redd.it/ekvmat|12|0.84|0|17|1|books

ekebs9|2020-01-05 15:26:11|Struggling to read? Here's 6 helpful tips!|"Backstory: I've been diagnosed with ADHD. I used to struggle a lot with books so my love affair with them has been complicated to say the least. Thankfully, with the following tips, I've been able to read a lot more. I'll try to keep this concise and I hope this helps! 

1. Struggling to pick that book up?
Are you struggling to begin a book or even to pick a book back up? Think about when you tend to read. Do you have a routine location?
If you read in bed and it's not working out then read elsewhere. If you read on the train and you just can't seem to pick that book up then think about the reason why. Is it the fact that it's too crowded on the train and it's too awkward to pick your book up? Is it that you're procrastinating on your phone?
If so, consider reading through other means.

----------------

2. Get a Kindle
Not only will cashing out for a Kindle force you to justify the purchase by reading, but it's genuinely more convenient. Instead of lugging around a huge novel, you can just pull your Kindle out from your pocket. You can read in the dark. The battery lasts for ages and you can customise the text to make it easier for you to read and the books are cheaper. 

----------------

3. Make a GoodReads account
Keep track of what you're reading and keep a record of what you've read. It's motivating to see how much you've read and to set yourself a goal for the year. Leaving reviews of the books can help the site give you recommendations of books you may like. It's also very satisfying when you change a 'Want to read' to a 'Reading' and finally to 'Read'.

----------------

4. Read wherever you can, whenever you can
Don't be afraid to read a bit if you're waiting for your cooking to finish or if your kid is watching their show. A chapter at a time is great, but it's completely fine to put a book down mid-chapter. If you want to read for hours on end, find a way to do it and don't be ashamed to do so

----------------

5. Increase your vocabulary
When using a Kindle, you can highlight words if you don't know its definition. This will give you the word's definition and it will add it to a list of flashcards. You can review the words whenever you like and try to memorise the meaning. When it becomes part of your day-to-day vocabulary, you can move it to a 'mastered' list. If you don't have a Kindle, you can simply write the words down in little books for words that you're learning and mastered words respectively.

----------------

6. Are you enjoying the book?
Think to yourself if you're enjoying the process of reading this particular book. Maybe you like the story and but you just cannot stand the prose. In that case, maybe look into audiobooks. If you simply are not enjoying the book, there's no shame in putting it down for good. Pass it onto someone else who may want to read it or give it to a charity shop. If you don't enjoy the book, your time is better spent reading something you will genuinely enjoy.

Any questions are welcome! I hope this helps! I've been reading the Wheel of Time series and these processes have really helped!

It seems like Pynchon just had a checklist of gross out fetishes and wanted to include them all (copraphilia, pedophilia, beastiality, maybe even all the gay sex was controversial in its time).

While the book is quite nebulous with its meaning/message (if it has any), I can still understand the overarching themes at play. But the abundance of sex scenes just seemed random and tacked on.

What's your opinion on his lack of speech marks and has he ever said why he writes without them?|"So my Mom bought me The Road and Blood Meridian for Christmas. I loved them so much that after devouring them in days I bought a few more of his books and currently am working through them. There is a massive list of positives and thoughts about his writing I could compile but what has caught me the most is his lack of speech marks. 

I've never seen anything quite like it. It was hard to get used to at first, now on his third book in like 2 weeks I'm used to it. The problem is I just can't quite work out WHY he does it. I don't see it really adding or taking anything away from his works nor can I think of any reason not to just add them. I can imagine his first editor probably thought the same.

But then I thought ""I don't have time for that, there are so many other books that I want to read!""

And I freaked out for a bit about not having enough time to read all the stories I want to read. And a general sense of being overwhelmed by the amount of information I want to take in set in. Then of course the physical, human limitations I have hit me in the balls.

ekf37u|2020-01-05 16:23:41|1Q84 killed me though I love Murakami. Did you like it? Hated it?|"I am a huge Murakami fan. Despite being a rather picky reader, some of my favorites are his (""Kafka on the Shore,"" ""Norwegian Wood,"" ""Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the World"").

So, it was almost a personal offense when **around page 850 out of 928 I finally gave up**, and I came here to see if anyone else had the same disappointing experience (no spoilers, I promise).

First off, I loved Aomame's character, and if I kept reading as far as I did was because I wanted to see what would happen to her. I still do, but not enough to force myself through the last 100 painful pages, when the world is full of books that deserve a chance.

What I hated:

1-**The endless repetitions**, unlike any other Murakami book. Every few hundred pages or so, he takes something that happened already and retells the whole thing in endless info dumps to other characters, or maybe a character will think about what happened in detail. This happens a number of times. Often the same event is narrated four of five times.

2-**Entire chapters that go nowhere**: Tengo wakes up and drinks coffee, then goes for a walk and thinks about the last chapter and then goes home.

3-The **irony** of the fact that no other Murakami novel I've read had pacing issues and the one that does (1Q84) has **entire chapters about how to edit a novel to ensure no extra words slow the pace down. Like, really?**

4-Like many, I love a good thriller where the reader strings clues together to come to a possible solution. Unfortunately that is not the case with 1Q84 where Ushikawa intuits his way to a resolution. Every single steps of the way he ""feels"" that this very unlikely situation is in fact what happened, and for the life of me, **I cannot read chapter over chapter of someone running through all possible scenarios to intuit their way through them, more so when the reader already knows exactly what has happened. It just felt like reading a grocery list.**

**Conclusion**: I am not sure if Murakami experimented with something I'm too daft to understand, but humbly it looks like he's either lost his spark or thought he did not need an editor this time around.

Ironically, I felt like Tengo with ""Air Chrysalis""; I see the potential and want to re-write it in 300 pages. Lol, how arrogant of me! Maybe that's what he intended?

I most definitely would not recommend this book to anyone.

ekqurx|2020-01-06 07:45:58|Which book should you read according to your mood?|"Books when you feel angry at the world and all you wish for is an apocalypse: Things we lost in the Fire by Mariana Enriquez- Well, this is not a feeling we accept to others, but sometimes when the rage becomes uncontrollable, Things we lost in the Fire is perfect to read while indulging in your revenge fantasy. This short story collection is diabolically dark and has such an unsettling magic that you will be afraid to continue with the next story, yet you'll not be able to put it down.


When you are melancholy and confused at the same time: Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami- There is a lingering sadness in each page of the book like a needle pricking your skin which you cannot locate. This novel is especially best if you read it during winter wearing gloves and your breath rising as a silvery wisp.

When you've had enough of other people's BS: Circe by Madeline Miller: Nothing speaks empowerment than an overlooked witch in classical Greek tragedies who's made a heroine of her own right by the delightful pen of Madeline Miller. It has such an engaging plot and a strong but vulnerable character who we can't help but root for.

When you are melancholy but introspective: The Gift of Rain by Tan Twan Eng- The Gift of Rain is a hauntingly beautiful tale set in the backdrop of Japanese invasion of Malaya. The imagery is gorgeous and the characters are beautifully complex. The plot has multiple layers of survival, mysticism, family and love. If you can read just one book from this list, this is the one. 

When you've lost faith in humanity:
1. Tiny Beautiful Things by Cheryl Strayed- This is a gem of a book which will restore your faith in the beauty of being human. Extracted from the column Dear Sugar on Rumpus, each letter and its answer will make you cry, laugh or sometimes both.

2. This Modern Love by Will Darbyshire- There is just one word for it- Heartwarming.

3. Chicken Soup for the Soul: Women to Women

4. Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom: Book that will never fail to make you cry.

When you're stuck in your sweltering small town and it makes you claustrophobic: Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn- Diabolically, wicked women who'll make your skin crawl whom you can't help but secretly wish to be like them.

When you want to get lost in a good story during midsummer- The Lake House by Kate Morton- Reading Kate Morton's novels is going back to the old days gone with the wind. The Lake House is a delightful novel to read with an engaging plot which surprises you.

When you are more than interested in the forbidden secrets of your town: Into The Water by Paula Hawkins- It has an autumnal feel with all its mystery and secrets. Add to it, all those witchy references!

When you just want to escape your real life: Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern- The descriptions are enchanting and the book makes a great autumnal read if you want the taste of a fairytale of grown ups."|dreamerimagine1|False|https://redd.it/ekqurx|1|0.5|0|0|1|books
ekga62|2020-01-05 17:48:17|Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami|"I finished Norwegian Wood today. It was first my Murakami book, and reading it was a strange experience for me. 

Before this book, I’d been reading at a very fast pace, going through hundreds of pages per day (most days), but when it came to this novel I slowed down a lot. 

I got on well with Murakami’s writing style from the start, and I appreciated that the Toru was an extremely well-crafted character. However I just wasn’t enjoying the book that much.

At the halfway point, I left it for a few months. I came back to it on a plane 2 days ago, and found myself actually enjoying it a lot, but in a weird kind of way. 

I found Midori’s character to be phenomenal, and possibly my favourite part of the book overall. How she was both so strong and broken simultaneously really hit me in a way that not many characters ever do.

For me, the best scene of the book was when Toru was left alone with Midori’s dying father. It was so well-written that I can see myself coming back to re-read it regularly.

Regarding the ending, I was as confused as you’d expect. I’ve quickly read some interpretations from other people, and found some that I like. I think it’ll take some time for me to really understand what I think it meant, though."|cheeseballsandjam|False|https://redd.it/ekga62|11|0.93|0|5|1|books

So much so that I'll pick it up and get engrossed in it and then I'll stop myself and put it back down. This is the first book I'm no ruahing to finish.

ekcx07|2020-01-05 13:19:48|Would you continue reading a book to the end if you decide halfway that you don't like it?|"Every year I set a goal of reading a certain number of books. Last year was 50, and this year I'm aiming for 65. I prepare a list of books to read and hope to complete before the end of the year. These consist of interesting titles or book recommendations from friends and Reddit. 

However, I've noticed a recurring dilemma that pops up: there's often a number of books that, midway upon reading, I decide I do not like for one reason or another. It could be that I dislike the author's construction of words, or that I found the plot to be slow-paced and dragging, or that it just wasn't the quality that I expected it to be.

By 1/3 of the book, I can generally determine whether or not I'll enjoy reading the rest of it.
I'm not the fastest reader out there, and managing my time becomes harder each year as my schedule grows tighter due to college demands. I can't decide for myself whether I should move on to my next book without completing the current one, or to suck it up and finish what I started, but potentially lose time to get to the books I could be enjoying instead.

I read it for the first time about a year ago and even though most part of the book just went over me (as I haven't read much at that point), I could perfectly see there was something special and deep in that book.

A few minutes ago I just finished my second read and I feel like I have finally understood the most part of it. The apparently ""empty"" main character (which in my opinion is not empty at all), the absence of regret after the crime, the trial...
But the last phrase is still almost as mysterious and mind-blowing as it was a year ago.

In case somebody does not remember it clearly or just want to read it again, I will quote it (SPOILER ALERT)

>!""For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.""!<

ekaw4l|2020-01-05 09:29:14|Becky Chambers|"Last year I read *The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet* and *A Closed And Common Orbit.* Part of what impressed me about the first one was that Chambers managed to break a lot of the traditional rules of storytelling and still write a very engaging book - there is very little conflict and really only minimal suspense. Everything is really just about family and friends and care. She builds her universe with great love and it was a very warm escapist read that was perfect for someone who is feeling down or lonely. I couldn’t believe a publisher had picked it up, since it so obviously doesn’t do the things publishers seem to believe every book should do - it lacks an antagonist, it lacks an emphatic narrative arc. So it was no surprise to discover that it was originally self-published via kickstarter. I wish publishers would learn to take a chance again. 

*A Closed And Common Orbit* was quite a development in my view. The themes of family and friendship were expanded to consider loneliness, and there was some clearer social commentary on poverty and capitalsim / imperialism. I thought it was a very beautiful book. A great example of how Sci-fi can show an idealistic view of human potential while also dealing with some of the darker sides of life. 

Both of these books have almost a YA feel to the way they are written, and are easy but rewarding reads for an open-minded reader. I also really appreciate finding a female, LGBTQ* version of sci-fi that just seems to take these things for granted in the text. 

I’m now reading *Record of a Spaceborn Few.* I’ve been really looking forward to it, but so far it is not grabbing me like the others. I really hope it turns around. 

What do you think about Becky Chambers? I assumed she was very well-liked because I always see her books in the bookshop, but I haven’t seen her discussed much here.

ekbpi5|2020-01-05 11:07:32|Looking for a science fiction subgenre|"I recently looked at a couple of lists of science fiction subgenres. What seems to be missing is a subgenre that describes science fiction works placed in primitive environments or the distant past. Some short story and novelette examples might include Ted Chiang's ""Tower of Babylon"" or James Blish's ""Surface Tension."" Another example would be stories which take place on another planet where the local beings have primitive technology, or stories on earth about our hominid ancestors. The distinctive quality of such fiction is that it looks to the past rather than the future, but the emphasis is still on science and technology in that context.

I'm curious. Is there a name for this subgenre of science fiction? Thanks for any ideas. (Cross-posted to r/sciencefiction)"|Marcassin|False|https://redd.it/ekbpi5|16|0.88|0|6|1|books

And the one I was most interested in was *The Bachman Books*

Stephen King has always been one of my favorite authors, and I wish my mom would've told me she secretly read his books as well. Like mother, like son I guess.

It happened to me quite often reading authors of the Latin American Boom that I just kept reading books non-stop and I hated how 70% of them turned out to have a boring ending. Nevertheless, I kept reading, I was just interested to see how the story turned out. 

All this time I said I disliked that genre, since I found it boring.

Now, reflecting on that after 15 years, I cannot say I disliked it. I read through 300-pages books which somehow I found entraining because I wanted to get to the end and know what was the outcome of it.

Bottom-line: if you read a whole book without any kind of obligation, then it entratined you because you finished it, and you cannot say you disliked it.

ekgppm|2020-01-05 18:18:34|My experience reading the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri|"This past Christmas, my friends and I did a Secret Santa between us. My secret santa gave two books: a collection of short stories by Edgar Allan Poe, and the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. I thought that it was great! I always wanted to read the Divine Comedy, but it wasn't in my to-read list. 

I didn't quite like it. At the beginning I thought the way it was written made it hard for me to follow, altho I found some things that I thought were very cool. But other than that it was it for me, hard to follow. When I was a bit more then half way thru I realized that I was just reading to finish it (because it was a present from a dear friend), not because I was enjoying it. 

I read a post recently that said that you should read books that you enjoy, not the ones you think you should read. So I decided to leave the Divine Comedy where I left it and start reading the Allan Poe one, maybe I have better luck with that one. I'm still planning on returning to finish the Divine Comedy. 

Anyone else has a similar story with a book?"|HoldingDoor|False|https://redd.it/ekgppm|2|0.6|0|4|1|books

eke4hi|2020-01-05 15:09:36|People often ask about books that should be movies, but what movies or TV shows would you want to see turn into a book series?|"Ok, I'm a bit weird. Let me explain, before I watch a movie, I read the synopses online most of the time. I go into it expecting something, and it more often than not doesn't live up to my expectations or the imagery that I've built up in my head.  

Even things like fight scenes (which look awesome), somehow feel more visceral in books and I find myself often wishing that such and such movie or tv series would become a book. 

The Bourne Series is an example of one that held my attention as a book series, but didn't grip me as a movie. Harry Potter (wow, I know, so basic), is another one. 

Netflix's The Invisible Guest works like all the mystery books I read so much that I'd love to see a writer's take on it and the multiple perspectives. etc.

ek8cou|2020-01-05 04:57:28|The Suppression of the Executrix: Male Backlash to Feminine Autonomy in The Crying of Lot 49|"\[ I just posted a more-detailed [version](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThomasPynchon/comments/ek84qt/the_suppression_of_the_executrix_male_backlash_to/) of this discussion (based on a paper I wrote) over on r/ThomasPynchon if anyone is interested in reading the full thing. \]  


A lot of people seem to consider Thomas Pynchon's depiction of female characters to be a blind spot of his. I've read all his books more than once, and *The Crying of Lot 49* probably more so than the rest, and although I felt that way after my initial reading of the book, every time  I reread the book over the years, the more I come to see Pynchon really seemed to craft the tale very deliberately to depict the misogyny Oedipa Maas faced in her investigations of the Tristero. 

>Oedipa Maas is a stereotypical 1960’s housewife living on the margins of her life and completely defined by her role as a wife and a woman. When she is unexpectedly made the executrix of her ex-lover’s will, she is compelled to take her first steps into the world on her own and subsequently thrust into the discovery of an ancient and secret society of nefarious mail couriers called the ‘Tristero’. As she sheds the figurative shackles of her former existence, she is met with resistance by virtually every male force she encounters through the novella; the sustained assaults, seductions, and outright dismissals of Oedipa act as an extended metaphor for the heroine’s journey for meaning against a hostile universe.

When contrasted with the contemporaneous rise of second-wave feminism in the 1960s, this little novella appears to be Thomas Pynchon's way of acknowledging the struggles women were facing in everyday life as they tried to break free from the patriarchal forces of Western society that had kept them suppressed for centuries. Every step Oedipa Maas tries to take toward getting more information for her investigation, the more the men around her would lash out at her in some way, shape or form. 

It comes to a head in the fifth and penultimate chapter when she meets a member of the ""Inamorati Anonymous"", a fictional group that seems like a rather prescient 60s-era forefather to modern-day misogynist groups like ""MGTOW"" or ""Incels"". While most people who have read the book think this is an unusual addition to the story so late in the narrative, it seems like a natural endpoint when viewing the story from a feminist lens.

People who have read *The Crying of Lot 49*; am I alone in thinking this work is a pro-feminist text; am I stretching? I'd love to hear some other opinions."|CruelLeoBloom|False|https://redd.it/ek8cou|10|0.81|0|4|1|books

eka3v8|2020-01-05 07:56:45|My thoughts on Gillian Flynn's 'Gone Girl'|"After reading a handful of mystery fiction, I came across this book. *Gone Girl*. As everyone previously before me stated, the unreliability of both Nick and Amy was a fascinating and distinct characteristic of the novel. I thought the book was neat overall and definitely a little superior than the books that I had previously read. I loved how it focused very heavily on the relationships of the characters and not just on the crime. Throughout the book, I noticed that I genuinely hated both Amy and Nick. This has never happened to me. I have never in the past **hated** a character. Both of them had their own facades and it sometimes made it very difficult to understand their point of views. But I then realized that the author was most likely doing her job if she could entice such an emotion from her readers. The overall structure of the book was pretty great. This is not the first time I have read a book that featured alternating perspectives. However, the use of diaries, symbols of intimate thoughts, to manipulate the reader was a genius tool utilized by Flynn. For a significant chunk of the book, I was trusting everything that Nick and Amy were writing just because they were **writing in a diary**. I also loved how the book displayed that we as people not only lie to others, but also ourselves. It also depicted how we are all wrong and right according to different perspectives. Nick and Amy can both be seen as wrong or right if judged through different lenses. 

The only criticism that I have of the book was its lack of 'shock value.' I think because the book began to display the 'back-end mechanism' of how Amy carried out her plan in the **middle** of the plot as well as the heavy emphasis on the relationships of the characters, the effect of the overall 'shock' lessened. But it was an interesting move regardless. Most books shower the reader with bits and pieces of the mystery and then reveal the entire thing in the end; *Gone Girl* does not. The end surprise is very pleasing and significant to me when I read mysteries, so I was expecting the same in this novel. However, the focus on complex relationships as well as symbolism made things work for the most part."|Commissioner_dr|False|https://redd.it/eka3v8|6|0.67|0|1|1|books
ek74ns|2020-01-05 03:10:12|The goldfinch by Donna tartt: just read.|"Its the first Time I’ve read a book for leisure in a really long time. It’s safe to say it had quite an impact on me as I basically started it on Friday and finished it on Monday!

The biggest thing that drew me in was the relationship between Theo and Boris. The domestic routine they get into, their almost complete reliance on each other in the face of completely checked out parental figures and of course the slightly ambiguous sexual relationship they have. 

To be honest I would have appreciated a more definitive conclusion to the romantic side of their relationship as in my view it is made pretty explicit that Theo is attracted/in love with Boris, both during their time in Vegas and when the reconnect as adults, although I did find Boris’s feelings around this to be far less apparent. It seems at times that he is entirely ambivalent about their sexual relationship although I did feel that may of just been an attempt to project onto Theo example: “Not that. Although I will say, you are the only boy I have ever been in bed with!” My laugh spluttered out angrily, as if I’d coughed or choked on something. ”With that—” Boris leaned back disdainfully in his chair, pinched his nostrils shut—”pfah. I think it happens at that age sometimes. We were young, and needed girls. I think maybe you thought it was something else”.

The problem is that fantasy novels tend to be a lot longer; the ones I read at least and with the limited time I get to read they take a while to get through and I get impatient about wanting to start other books.

I was curious if I would love them again and if I would find some more than just fun in them now.
In short yes and yes, and below is a more detailed account of my thoughts. 
I would love to get others' perspective, especially since this is currently the most popular reading material on Amazon (wow). So please share!

- As before, the short stories (first two books) really seem much better than the novels (the following 5 books) with the exception of the one with Regis and Milva
- This is the kind of wry, vulgar humor that I adore. I love the exorcism joke in The Last Wish.
- I'm reading in English this time, translated by Danusia Stok, and it does lose a lot of language humor and depth. Who translated your versions? How do you like it?
- there is definitely a domme vibe to Yennefer that went absolutely above my head the last time. I like her even more now:)
- I never noticed before but this IS definitely a dying world there and the parallels to our times are astounding, environmental context, war, discrimination, it's all there and not superficially either. All this bears a lot of meaning for both the heroes and the plot. At the same time it's all shown through dialogue and plot, not described in a straightforward way. A lot of things you have to guess and imagine and I think this is awesome
- while I used to identify with Ciri, I'm now more focused on Geralt and Yennefer and their quarrels and discussions struck a true chord, this is well done
- I like the raw masculinity of Geralt and how he tries to surpress it with literature and philosophy but it mostly doesn't work; what does though is fatherhood. This is super interesting to me
- likewise, parenthood is a major theme throughout the series. Starting with the striga, who was the king's daughter, with Nenneke, who is a mother figure, Calanthe, there are a lot of parents there and Yennefers dream of being a mother fits this theme

I could go on and on about impossible choices, choosing sides, realism, companionship etc but I'd rather read what other people have to say:)"|ujezdzamkraby|False|https://redd.it/ejxbbo|48|0.86|0|17|1|books

As a member of r/ayearofwarandpeace (which by the way, just started reading it for 2020! 1 chapter a day for 365 days!) I think a year of Finnegan’s Wake would make this beast more manageable.

On the Something Beyond Ourselves chapter, the author made a reference on the denial of death by Becker about a person having two selves, the first one being physical and the second being conceptual and that people focus on doing what he called ""immortality projects"" which allow the conceptual self to live way past the point of our physical death. All of human civilization is a result of these projects: cities, governments, authority figures like Jesus, religion, politics; Becker considers these as a problem and encourages questioning of conceptual self and be more comfortable with the reality of their own death where we are able to liberated from illogical quest for immortality.

Then onto the next chapter, The Sunny Side of Death, the author talked about confronting the reality of our own mortality and with death confronting us all of the most important question: ""What is your legacy?"" - how will the world be any different and better when you're gone? 

This is where I find it confusing. Isn't this legacy the result of this quest for immortality that Becker talked about, regardless of the underlying value or intention of the person? I think the author wants to make a point in making a difference through our values, then consequently our actions because our time is limited here on earth. To me, these chapters just seemed contradictory, but I'm not sure if I'm understanding it right, hence this post.

>**""He considered settling onto the stairway to sleep until daylight, and finishing what he had come to do in the clean light of morning.""**

OK, so what's wrong with that?

Here's the scenario: A cop has tracked a serial killer to a small tropical island. He sets up a trap for the killer and stays up until 3am waiting for him to show, but no luck. 

The cop deduces that the killer may be staying in an abandoned, decaying hotel on the other side of the island, which is mostly jungle. So he treks through the jungle in the dark, following a path, getting scared by the local wildlife. He finds the hotel. It's falling apart, covered in moss and vines. 

He sees a window, with flickering candlelight, and the silhouette of a man. This could be the killer.

So he enters cautiously, and quietly sneaks upstairs. Everything is old and rotting. He comes to a big hole. He jumps across, teeters for a second, making a little noise. His stomach drops. He's scared, his heart is beating fast. 

Then...
HE CONSIDERS SLEEPING ON THE STAIRS?
IN THE CREEPY ABANDONED HOTEL WITH THE SERIAL KILLER, WHO KNOWS THIS COP IS AFTER HIM?

This makes no fucking sense. None. I'm trying to imagine how it might make sense, and I just can't. 

After 3,000 miles, he's just a short walk away from this psycho. But he's in the middle of nowhere, it's terrifying and dark, he has no backup, nobody knows where he is. He's jacked up and scared. NOBODY is going think ""maybe I should go to sleep now""... and if they do, they sure as shit don't decide to do it right in the stairway, with no alarm clock, no light. Where the guy who *cuts off eyelids and burns people to death* might come across them while they're passed out and helpless. 

I got through 95% of the book thinking ""wow, this is pretty good considering it's his first novel"" but that one line has damn near ruined it, it's just so nonsensical."|CreeDorofl|False|https://redd.it/ejl72t|37|0.85|0|34|1|books
ejplqs|2020-01-04 01:46:21|Thoughts on True Grit by Charles Portis|"\-This was my first read of True Grit, and my first exposure to Portis. I have never seen the films, so I was able to dive into this short novel pretty much blind. I was rewarded with a quick, yet enthralling read. Mattie Ross is a youthful heroine out to avenge the murder of her father by the snake Tom Chaney.  What ensues is a classic western adventure most readers would enjoy.

\-This novel had a charm and a wit to it that I was not expecting. The banter between Mattie and the likes of Rooster, Col. Stonewall, LeBoeuf, and even Lucky Ned Pepper is quirky and brave. Mattie is an easy protagonist to get behind, and her journey was a fun follow. Language was really well used here by Portis to give a southern flavor to it's scenery and flesh out its characters. Each main character had a strong build from Mattie's stubborn steadfast piousness to Rooster's drunkard, bravado. Bits of history gave background to a strong setting, such as mentions of President Rutherford B. Hayes, and the dynamic the American Civil War still had on the North and South. I would say it's a smart, quick-paced, action-packed Western with a strong female lead. Really well-done.

\- I really liked the dynamic between the pious and conservative youth in Mattie, and the old, drunk, crude marshall Cogburn. It's an ""opposites attract"" scenario, and by the end of the story their relationship becomes a powerful one. 

\- I have heard the book suffers a bit in reputation because of the films, both which I have not seen. That's really unfortunate. True Grit's strength rests on poetic language and wit, in a setting many of us modern adventure seekers can only fantasize about. My one criticism of the book would be it's climax was a tad underwhelming, but the build was immense. The shootouts are well done, and the relationship between Rooster and Mattie is unique. I recommend this book to anyone, ESPECIALLY people who want to get into reading after a long hiatus. It's not long (about 150 pages), and full of grand quotable characters. It's got a little something for everyone, be it a wild Arkansas frontier, gun-toting bandits, a hardened female avenger, or a one-eyed man of ""true grit"".

After some research, I noticed that most people is using it just as a tracker of what they read and want to read.

And in that space, I would expect - and love - to find a functional and good looking social network which bases content in users' interactions with books. 

I think most of us are just conforming with Goodreads, while we would prefer something completely different. If this is true, we are missing the opportunity to create a proper space online where book lovers can socialize and share their love for books in a fulfilling way.

Anyway. 

I just wanted to tell you all that it's fine to read whatever you want to read. You don't have to read the classics just because they're there. If you want to read something else - something that interests you more, then go for it! 

I used to say 'I want to read X number of books this year/month' etc and usually I'd end up picking almost entirely from the classics. But I've got news for you - just because they're universally acknowledged as 'classics' doesn't mean they have universal appeal. Frequently, I'd end up abandoning the goal. 

You might find them slow or dull or you don't connect with the characters because you're a 30-year-old man who works as an engineer in Manchester and you struggle to relate to the woes of 19th-century socialites, soldiers and vagabonds. ^(That's not a description of me btw)

I used to find it difficult to read if I was reading something I didn't wholeheartedly enjoy. These days I pick a few books I believe I'll like and then follow it up with a classic I'm unsure of. 

But ultimately my message is that you shouldn't feel pressured to read certain things - read because you enjoy it not because it's something to check off. 

For me - this means my next 5 list looks like this: 

*Ayoade on Top* - Richard Ayoade

*Lanny* - Max Porter

*The Wall* - John Lanchester

Sharp enough kid, but I am sure a lot of nuance was lost on me. I always meant to revisit the series but after my mother's passing in 2009 it became one of those painful nostalgias. You know how it is. She was a huge Anne Rice fan, and she really loved the Neil Jordan movie as well. I would get to watch it all the time as a kid. She was super cool about letting me delve into adult content. Eventually I read the series and I believe I made it as far as Blood Canticle. Or perhaps Blood and Gold. One of those. My memory stops around Memnoch though. I've really fallen out of reading but for some reason I woke up on the first day of 2020 with a burning desire to revisit the Vampire Chronicles. I am just curious what the general consensus is about the latter books, supplemental stuff, the ""new tales"" series and so on. What to skip, if anything, what to avoid, etc. Seeing a book title about Lestat and Atlantis seems a bit odd but then again she handled stranger subjects pretty well so who knows? I kind of remember there being split opinions on the later books so I was wondering what you guys think. For me personally, twisting of lore or taking stories in stupid directions can often taint the older stories or make them ring more hollow.

ejmh15|2020-01-03 21:56:43|Book Club?|"Hi all-

Apologies if this is the wrong sub to post this in, but I think it's relevant enough.

I'm trying to start a book club to read through Stephen King's Dark Tower series. I'll be made up of people I know in the real world and people online, so I'm probably looking at something online. 

I've never been a part of a book club though. How do you go about managing how much people read? I don't even know how I'd do that with one book, much less a whole long series like that. As anyone who has read the series can tell you, it's very easy to spoil things for people who aren't that far behind you (things can turn upside down in 20 pages). 

I was thinking of possibly segregating it into different message boards for each book, then maybe having sub-posts in each for different headings, then people can post in the spot where they are in their reading? 

I still don't know how I'm going to organize this. I was looking around online but it seems like most of the tools that are available are for setting up actual meet-up book clubs, even for ones that are online. I'm trying to get it so that we can get discussions going about the book. There's a dark tower subreddit that has discussions, but I want mine to be just a limited group of people. 

Plus I have a running bet with all my friends that I'll give the first person to tell me my Reddit handle in person gets $10 and I don't intend to lose that easily! 

Anybody ever do something like this before? 

If what I'm looking for doesn't exist, would this sort of thing be of interest to anyone? If there's enough interest, I might develop it myself! I'm a programmer and I've got programmer friends, one of whom is going to be reading The Dark Tower with me for the first time within the next month or so :D"|YouGoThatWayIllGoHom|False|https://redd.it/ejmh15|1|0.6|0|0|1|books

eiom8r|2020-01-01 22:08:45|PSA: You don’t have to have an ambitious reading goal|"PSA: You don’t have to have an ‘ambitious’ reading goal for 2020

Well, New Year’s is here, and of course, people have started setting resolutions—some to read 12, 25, or even 52 books.

I think it bears repeating, though: it’s totally okay to *not* beat yourself up trying to polish off your 18th book for the year. Slow your Audible down to 0.5X speed or even 0.25X and savor. Mmm. Really enjoy those books, you voracious reader, you.

One year I opted to just re-read Fahrenheit 451 each month. I read about Guy Montag, line-by-line, 12 straight times. It was so soothing, and I loved the release of not having to feel like I was constrained to read a lot of new books.

(Side note; Guy Montag is the main character in a book about *burning* books. Is this where Guy Fieri [read:fire] got his name? Very likely. Just one of the interesting tidbits I picked up from my year of 451.)

Our society seems to prioritize competition, ambition, etc. so much, often to the detriment of sitting back and enjoying reading with no objective other than enjoying a hobby. Seems kinda like a different society that a certain Orwell wrote about, know what I mean? But DAE think it wasn’t supposed to be an *instruction* *manual?*

So in case no one has told you today:
It’s okay to slow down. 
Feel free to savor your books and read them at your own pace. 
It’s alright to only finish a few. 
It’s okay to not read for several years.
It’s okay to never read again.

It’ll even be okay if you don’t count your books at all.

For instance, my goal this year is simple: read only books I enjoy. This will likely include only five books: The Stand by Stephen King, Harry Potter reread (sixth time,) the Way of Kings by the illustrious Brandon Sanderson, 1984, and the Very Hungry Caterpillar (will probably read it to my son.) 

Also—audiobooks count as books. Light novels count. Graphic novels count. Novellas count. Short stories count. Anything counts if you read it or listened to it and it’s a book to you. Even the backs of cereal boxes.

My point is this: you don’t have to challenge yourself at all. It’s okay to set your goals so low that you have virtually no ambition to show for it."|BaudelaireHeHoo|False|https://redd.it/eiom8r|6908|0.93|2|717|1|books

Thank you, /r/books for the rec.|"I went into *Ella Minnow Pea: A Novel in Letters* expecting a quick, light read that was put reccommended as a book that was written in an experimental style that added an extra layer to the enjoyment and value of it all.


That experimental style was definitely there and did not disappoint in any way. But what I found, in addition to the stylistic techniques, were an abundance of themes and settings that ABSOLUTELY hit hom with current state of things in life/the world.


Without even trying, I began to see so many modern-day paralells. Themes, characters, arguments, quotes, attitudes....everything. 



Suddenly the book led my thinking from a meely entertainment standpoint to a more philosophical one. I really was thinking so deeply into the problems posed in this book...because I wanted to help provide a solution--a feeling I have encountered often in real life lately.



For those who haven't heard of or read this book, I would reccomend it. It began an internal discussion for me that touched upon a myriad of subjects. These subjects certainly are hot topics in modern times and will be relevant to many conversations I will have in the future, I am sure.

I've read the short story It's a Good Day by J. Bixby.

Is there any cultural association attached to purple that I'm not aware of? I know that **purple prose** is complicated writing in an effort to sound sophisticated but which may sound artificial, and that you can be **purple with rage** meaning that you're very angry.

I feel like she’s mostly just jealous of Zélie and all the attention she’s getting and Zélie is really just trying to do what she needs to do and has a strong foundation with her people. 

She’s always been accepted and the minute she’s not, she wants to gain attention and power by challenging Ramaya to be elder of the connectors? Bull fucking shit. And has the *nerve* to say she’s been fighting for them as long as Zélie AND! AND! AND! Mentions, I don’t know how many times, that “no one understands that I’m fighting for aalllllll of Orïsha.” K great, Amari, but the magi have been oppressed almost as long as you’ve been alive and they’ve had to fight for themselves. 

Just had to rant because, man, is she pissing me off. I understand her point about making peace but she’s being very “why isn’t anyone paying attention to ME.” Bugs the shit out of me that she has no idea of their ways and just wants to barge in.

That being said, Tomi does a wonderful job of painting a picture of social issues regarding, well, anyone who is not white.

P.S. also...did the end feel like a betrayal to anyone else?After the words said in that car, directed at her. It seems like a pointless, senseless,just for the sake of it ""slap in the face""? Why ?

I've never had such visceral reactions to a book in my life. I found myself getting physically agitated by Edith. She is so hateful and at the same time so real that at points I had to stop and take a break. I think many of us have known someone with that passive aggressive cruelty that she embodies so well. At the same time it's hard to see her without sympathy because of her ostensibly cold upbringing. 

Lomax and Walker got my blood pressure up as well. This book just keeps denying you good things though, after Stoner's immensely satisfying destruction of Walker during the exam, it all comes to nothing thanks to politics in the end. 

I felt sympathy for Stoner throughout, I think his stoicism was admirable in some situations but his relationship with his daughter was devastating and infuriating to me. I have a young daughter so perhaps this colored my perception but I wanted to scream at the book for him to DO something. The way his sweet child is just ground down by Edith absolutely gutted me. 

This was the first book I've ever read where my wife actually asked me what was wrong as I was reading it, and I had to tell her I was legitimately stressed out. It was a departure from my usual fantasy or science fiction but affected me on a much deeper level. I can't say I had fun reading it, but it was very moving and I highly recommend it."|Sir_Grumpy_Buster|False|https://redd.it/eiz7qy|35|0.94|0|8|1|books

I thought the book was really good. It was well-written with generally convincing characters. The men were not as well drawn as the women, but I liked how it told three stories that were all compelling, and it was still entertaining even though I knew how it would end from the TV show. 

I also thought it was interesting to realize that the book is set in Australia, and that the transition to America for the HBO series was so easy to do. They only changed one character meaningfully in my opinion - Bonnie was less of a cliché and more of a whole person on the show. 

I just wanted to share my reflections on the book and chat with anyone who liked it. It’s not a typical novel for me to read so other perspectives would be interesting.

ej3qvb|2020-01-02 20:29:04|Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Can we have discussion please?|"I finished reading Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. And for a while I was conflicted whether this really was dystopia or utopia. When I was reading 1984, the story had a gloomy atmosphere and I also felt that gloom. But while reading The Brave New World, for the most part I was unmoved. But it really got me thinking. And after much thinking, I think I loved BNW.

A world, where there is no ambition. No wishes unfulfilled for all they wish for is soma. All of them think they are living in privilege and almost everyone is happy with their position. I wouldn't call this world a happy world, but rather a content one. And even those who are not content get a choice to live their life on their own terms with people like them on an island.

The major conflict in this story according to me was the struggle of individuality that we first see through Bernard and later John. There is liberty to move around freely and to be with anyone. But there is no personal liberty nor personal space. Solidarity is frowned upon. Admiring nature is queer. There is no thought process of their own and nothing to think or talk about. No artistic freedom for there is no such thing as art. No scientific thinking because science is limited. There is no philosophy. No literature. No other hobbies. No affection for each other. No progress, no growth. This civilization is stunted. So much that the humans feel like robots.

All of it feels like dystopia but only for those who are aware of what they are lacking in life. But BNW citizens are not aware of it. And when there is no awareness, how would they know if they are lacking something? 

If you are content , would you want to be happy? Would you risk being happy at the cost of contentedness and stability?

I loved the whole bit about class distinction. How they engineered humans and conditioned them was very interesting. My heart broke for john. In his past life and even in present, he was never accepted in either world. Not able to fit in anywhere. It was interesting how his mother was conflicted too. She had motherly feelings but was ashamed of it. When she was in the reservation she couldn't forget her past civilization. And when John was in the new world, he couldn't forget his past civilization. Linda embraced the old ways when she came back. Forgetting her son. And the son embraced his old ways in the new place, always remembering his mother.

And  I absolutely loved the conversation between Controller Mond and Savage John. It made many things clear. Also I liked how Mond was not evil and  unaware of things. He was empathetic and intelligent.

Also the bit about emotional engineering. I think our society engineers our emotions in some way too. Aren't we all expected to be social and do the things society think is normal? Society demands us to do certain things by certain age. And when someone is different or thinks differently, then that person is frowned upon. How are we different than BNW? Because we still have rationality and thinking power. And the choice to be ourselves. We have awareness about our identity and personality. And maybe that is what makes us more human.

eitqa2|2020-01-02 05:07:49|The four books that have spoken to me the most|"  

I'm bad at being concise so I won't blame you for heading straight to the TL;DR. This is a long, rambling post about my life so that might not be of interest to a lot of you. I do talk about books for most of it, though!

My passion for reading sometimes wanes when I go through low periods in my life. This morning though, I got up early, felt good and started reflecting on some of the ways that my favourite books have helped me at different points in my life. 'Spoken' is a weird word when discussing books, but it's accurate, I think. All great novels contain some message or other, I think, that can be informative, inspiring, or reassuring, and this, to me, is like a friend or loved one speaking to you and offering advice about where to go or what to do next. Here are the four books that have helped, or 'spoken' to me the most, in order of when I read them. 

Infinite Jest – David Foster Wallace

I was 21 when I read this book, and it was a pretty happy time in my life. I was in my third year of uni, and I'd enjoyed my degree and felt passionate about where I wanted to go in life and all that (I wanted to be a writer of some sort but had no direction or idea other than that). I felt pretty confident and good about myself, but lacked any solid social circle (due to some fairly severe social anxiety) and so I felt lonely a lot of the time. I was passionate about reading and writing, however, and was keen to challenge myself and read a big complex book. Almost immediately I was drawn to Wallace's prose, and even though I had no idea what was going on plot-wise for basically the whole first half of the book I was completely immersed in the world and the characters. 

To anyone who is turned off by this book I would say this: get past the first chapter and see if the second one about the marijuana addict hooks you. If yes, keep reading. If no, you probably won't enjoy the rest of the book. The way Wallace describes in this second chapter the addict's obsessive overthinking about when/if his weed dealer is going to arrive made me feel like I was reading a chapter about myself and the ways I would (and still do) over-analyse many interactions and relationships to the point of near madness. As I keep reading I found more and more characters who I could relate to in similar ways, and was consistently moved by how accurately Wallace was able to articulate the ways his character’s minds worked and how their anxieties and addictions ruled their lives and resulted in loneliness. 

I keenly felt my own lack of connection while reading Infinite Jest, and it was towards the end of the novel when I, along with the characters, started realising a few things. What the book taught me is that sincerity and love are how you connect with people—being ironic and trying to be cool gets you nowhere and only leads to more isolation and loneliness. IJ is of course a mammoth read and what I got out of it could be completely different to what someone else did, but the point of this post is that depending on where you’re at in your life great novels will speak to you in different ways. Anyway, moving on.

&amp;#x200B;

The Catcher in the Rye - J.D Salinger **(Spoiler warning)**

I was 22 when I read this, and it was a time when I could really relate to Holden and his cynicism about the world and about adult life. I’d just finished my degree and was unsure of where to go next and whether the whole writing thing was even for me/if I would ever get a job I enjoyed/if the world was even an interesting enough place to warrant living in. Keep in mind that at this point I was still bereft of any consistent social life, but was fortunate enough to have a very loving family. The social/generalised anxiety was still holding me back a lot, way more than I realised at the time, (I hadn’t come to terms with the fact that I had a mental illness at this point), so I was unable to see the joys of life and was spiralling, unknowingly, into a pit of bitterness and cynicism. 

Holden Caulfield’s story starts with him hospitalised after a mental breakdown. Unlike me, Holden is an outgoing person, but he too is unknowingly beaten down by his own distorted view of the world throughout the novel, which eventually leads to him becoming depressed and bored of the world and particularly of the people around him. Holden’s one of the most divisive characters in literature—there are those who dismiss him as whiny and entitled, and those who empathise with his frustration with the undeniable ‘phoniness’ of modern life (even though this is an old book I believe it’s even more relevant today with the advent of social media). 

Holden’s unwillingness to grow as a person, however, and move into adulthood, was what spoke to me in this book. It’s heavily implied that Holden suffered some kind of abuse as a child, which is likely to blame for his tendency towards cynicism and distancing himself from others. I was fortunate to have an upbringing free from any major trauma, but just happened to be predisposed to an anxiety disorder that worsened as I got older. Holden’s desire to be the catcher in the rye, someone who protects children playing in a field of rye from falling from the cliffs that surround it, or in other words, from growing up, made me see my own reluctance to enter the real world. I was still unemployed and had only had a few odd jobs here and there. The novel’s end, however, shows Holden experiencing something joyful—his sister enjoying herself on a merry go round. After all he’d gone through, and having endured a constant negative monologue in his mind (something I can easily relate to) he finds simple but profound joy in seeing a loved one enjoy themselves, and realises that there is a plenty of joy to be had in life if you stay present. This realisation brought back a lot of the passion I had lost after completing my degree and had a huge impact on my writing and view towards life.

&amp;#x200B;

The Road – Cormac McCarthy

McCarthy’s writing has an otherworldly quality to it, and reading his work feels like listening to some sort of all-knowing ancient sage. I was two years into another uni degree when I read it, and I was in a pretty bad place. I had hoped to make new friends, but still found myself struggling. I also wasn’t enjoying this degree as much, and found myself feeling out of place and ineffective. My sense of isolation was growing, and if I hadn’t had my family to rely on, I may have struggled to ever escape from the pits of depression I routinely fell into. 

I was 23 and beginning to think that being a writer was not going to be a particularly secure career path, especially for someone of my fluctuating temperament and lack of networking skills. Simply put, I was very lonely, and was beginning to forget what close friendship felt like. I begun to believe I was boring. The people in my course were nice enough, but I found myself unable to muster the courage to forge more than a few sporadic friendships. The worst part of it was that I was forgetting the feeling of warmth that comes with having a close friend there for you. Even though I had my family I yearned for more friends of my own age and to meet people with whom I had more in common.

Ben, an extremely quiet, muscular, tall dude (one of my few mates who I spoke with occasionally) recommended I read *The Road* after I told him how much I had loved *Blood Meridian*. I read it in a few days, and was left with a few things lingering in my mind. One of those things was the idea of ‘carrying the fire’. The father’s assurance to his son, even under the most dire circumstances, that both of them had a fire inside them that they had to keep alight reminded me of all the times I had been helped in my life by the good people close to me, and (this is going to sound corny) that as long as I kept my own fire alight I would find the direction and companionship I desired. 

East of Eden – John Steinbeck **(Spoiler warning)**

Fair warning: there’s lots of rambling ahead but I promise I’ll get to the book eventually. I’ve been browsing this subreddit for a while, and honestly got kind of sick of hearing about this book. There are hundreds of posts about it, so one day I decided to bite the bullet and read it. This was after I finished my second degree, and I was directionless. My passion for writing was gone, and I felt like I had wasted the last few years of my life. I lost contact with the few friends I had made at uni. My anxiety disorder was growing, but I denied it still. I refused to leave my comfort zone or to try antidepressants. I exercised religiously and stuck to a rigid meditation routine, but my lack of direction and passion was becoming a real problem, and my unwillingness to face my issues was leading to depression. 2018 was coming to an end, and I was 23. Then things changed. Rapidly.  

I was sitting at home one night when an old friend asked if I wanted to play PlayStation online with him and two of his mates I hadn’t met. By this point I was so desperate for friends that I jumped at the chance. I had been doing some good work with my therapist on my social anxiety and felt more confident in meeting new people. One of the new people was a woman who I developed an instant rapport with. She liked all the same games, shows, we had the same sense of humour, everything. My old friend’s other mate I also got along with amazingly well. The next few months were some of the best of my life. As I began hanging out with this new group, my social circle broadened, I reforged some old friendships, and started doing some of the things I’d always dreamed of doing. I finally belonged somewhere, and we were all very close. But there was still the lingering issue of my unresolved mental issues.

I found myself becoming more and more attached to the group, especially the woman, who I predictably developed a huge crush on. After a couple more months of me becoming more and more into her, I realised I had to just tell her or go insane. We’d become very close at this point and I was worried I would ruin the friendship or forever make it weird but I knew I had to take the risk. So I did, and was rejected, which obviously crushed me but we stayed friends and she assured me that nothing about our friendship had changed. It was around this time that I discovered the joys of drinking. I developed a problematic habit of pouring a couple of glasses of wine each night while gaming online with this woman and my other mates, to loosen my anxiety and bring out the funnier side of me. After a while this turned into a couple more glasses each night, then a couple more, then I was downing a bottle of red almost every night of the week. My mental health went down the shitter. I finally had great friends, sure, but I was still avoiding the whole getting a life thing. I’d done nothing with my degrees and the retail and hospitality jobs I’d had didn’t last. I started to become (I’m ashamed to say) jealous of my friends’ happiness, and I dwelled more and more on having been rejected by this woman who I was now obsessed with. Instead of getting out there and trying to meet some new people, I allowed myself to continue down this spiral, drank more and more and more, and had several public alcohol-induced breakdowns in front of my friends. I didn’t give a shit about writing or reading anymore, all I wanted was to drink or to be around people to distract me. I didn’t enjoy things anymore. I would go on aimless drives just so I could scream and cry without anyone hearing. I kept thinking that I was so privileged to have the life I had and yet my own mind was so defective that I was destroying myself. I was choosing self-destruction and was beginning to be fine with the idea of it.

During this whole period I slowly slogged my way through *East of Eden*, and began to see why Reddit kept going on about it. The characters in the book are flawed. They doubt themselves. They are unkind to each other. They make mistakes. They dwell on upsetting things. Adam Trask’s heartbreak almost kills him, but his children and his own force of will bring him back from oblivion. He eventually chooses happiness, with the help of others, of course. My favourite character in the book, however, is Cal, Adam’s son. Cal feels the darkness of his mother inside him, and he loathes it, but he can’t stop it from occasionally rising up. But the difference between Cal and his mother, Cathy, one of literature’s most evil characters, is that Cal *wants* to be good. 

A week ago I found myself in the hospital after a complete mental breakdown. I was told by a gruff mental-health worker to stop drinking, and initially I resented her harsh manner but now I realise it was what I needed. I dumped all the alcohol from the house and got on some antidepressants. I got back to exercising and meditation. I apologised to the friends I had been so dramatic towards so many times. I thanked my family for sticking by me. For the first time in my life I told my dad how much I loved him. In *East of Eden*, Adam Trask’s last word is ‘timshel’—the Hebrew word for ‘Thou mayest’ as opposed to ‘though shalt’. What I realised is that if ‘thou shalt’ then we’re all fucked. Because we all have bad sides and do shitty things. ‘Thou mayest’ puts the onus on us to be good and to make the right choices. It also lets us make mistakes and lets us be forgiven. ‘Do you take pride in your hurt?’ asks one of the book’s characters during a pivotal moment. ‘Does it make you feel large and important?’ I’ve got a long way to go but I don’t want to choose pain anymore.

I'd love to know what books have influenced your lives the most/taught you valuable lessons at a time when you needed them.

TL;DR:

Infinite Jest – Be sincere. 

The Catcher in the Rye – Recognise if your view of the world is distorted and redirect your attention to the joys of life.

The Road – Believe that people are largely good.

East of Eden – It’s up to you to choose to be good."|Kneebs|False|https://redd.it/eitqa2|47|0.92|0|21|1|books

The middle part (relating to Ryoji and the Mario plot) was too prolonged. I thought the ending would somehow tie it up due to how long it was.

Regarding Ryoji’s subplots, from a prostitution ring to ATM fraud, the police did not get a whiff of what’s going on - am I suppose to believe that the Japanese police is that incompetent? And the fact the PI was killed off, even though he was aware that someone was after him...

So, I've been a fan of Asian horror since I saw The Ring back in high school.

I'm about 40 pages into it and I'm noticing the prose feels...off? A lot of it feels clunky, too much verbiage going on, and it just feels wrong somehow. Sometimes it feels like the translator plugged the original Japanese text into an online translator and just went with it. 

I've read other books that were originally not in English and had good translations. I've read stacks of Haruki Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto, who are also Japanese writers. I've read *The Vegetarian* which was originally in Korean. And of course, I blasted through all three of Larsson's *Millennium* books which came from Sweden. Those all felt natural and were good reads. This version of *The Ring* feels like a task to read.

ej04ic|2020-01-02 16:10:09|Are there too many spoilers in book reviews? (sort of ranty)|"I've recently gotten back into reading fiction and also got into writing/reading reviews. I like reviews so I'm often drawn to reading a few reviews of books I'm interested in.

I've rapidly found that a TON of reviews contain spoilers without warning, especially in horror, thriller or classic fiction. For example, on the official plot synopsis of horror books, the 'hook' comes from being told only the basics of the premise and only hinting at the source of the horror. Yet many reviews explain exactly what the horror is, robbing you of the chance to discover along with the characters. I had The Ruins ruined for me, for example.

For classics (and this REALLY irritates me), there's an assumption that everyone knows how they end, so mentioning the end as part of the review seems like no big deal. I got really interested in reading Moby Dick. I read a review and within the first few lines, and without warning, it flippantly gave the ending away. Same thing happened when I read a review for 1984.

Obviously the solution is to stop reading reviews until I've read the book. I just think it's a shame, because I like reviews and feel that reading them after you've finished the book kind of defeats their purpose. Many reviewers seem to either not know where the line is between plot synopsis and spoiler, or presume everyone knows the ending to famous books because they're just as well-read as the reviewer. 
Okay, end rant.

eipr1w|2020-01-01 23:38:55|The Colour Out of Space (Spoilers)|"So I've started making my way through Lovecraft's bibliography, and after going through a few mediocre throwaways from early on in his career, I decided I should go straight for the big ones and read Lovecraft's personal favorite from his own work, The Colour Out of Space. 

The first two acts are absolutely fantastic. The slow build-up of things being ever so slightly *wrong* in a way nobody can quite describe is genuinely unnerving, and when things finally start going majorly south for the Gardners it manages to ramp up the stakes in a way that still keeps the true nature of whatever came down in the asteroid a mystery. The paragraph where Ammi is implied to kill Nabby is phenomonal at implying *just enough* to make you shiver. 

And then comes the climax. 

And...it's shit. 

It consists of seven characters, six of which are completely unnamed, walking around the Gardner household in broad daylight making general remarks about the strangeness. Nothing happens for most of it; Zenas and Merwin Gardner's remains are found relatively easily, when them remaining missing would have been far scarier. The uncomprehensive forces at play here are then comprehended quite easily under minimal scrutiny; it came from the water in the well. It's dangerously close to reducing a Lovecraftian abomination to a cholera outbreak, and ruins the implication that whatever was in the asteroid simply exudes *wrongness*. 

Then the Colour Out of Space...just kinda goes back to space. It just leaves. No confrontation, no heightening of the horror, no further terrifying implications. It just buggers off. The end. 

Oh, I suppose  there is the thing about a small piece remaining and Arkham city planners thinking about putting a reservoir up there. So the only implication of further threat is from people acting like complete idiots. You could defeat this thing with proper planning permission and outsourced water. 

I still enjoyed the story for its fantastic build-up, but if this is the best Lovecraft ever gets? I have to say I'm disappointed."|Bennings463|False|https://redd.it/eipr1w|2|0.71|0|4|1|books

eii58v|2020-01-01 13:04:39|Erebos 2 by Ursula Poznanski (review)|"So, the second part of Erebos was released a few months ago. Personally, I was fascinated by the first part when I read it one year ago. The story is unique and the idea of AI always interested me, anyway. 

So what about the second part? 
I don't think the book needed a sequel and the way it was put together is kind of poor. Erebos 2 as an alone standing book would have been amazing, but it seems like a joke as a sequel.
I am not going to spoil anything and I think for a fan of Erebos you can read the sequel, although you wouldn't miss out on a lot.
If you want to know what happened to the players after the first tragedy they went through, this book is definitely a go-to.

eiulxs|2020-01-02 06:31:02|Manufacturing consent, a critique|"Hello. I recently read the titular book. I did it try to get some understanding of libertarianism. My friend seems to put great stock in both the book and the political philosophy. I'm not convinced. This book was recommended to me as one of the ""classic"" books that discuss this philosophy. I didn't much care for it. However, I'm reading it in isolation. I have my own work to do, so it's hard to track down critiques and responses. Would one of you be so kind as to respond to my review? I apparently had a lot to say. Thank you.

Review:

> Wow what a crap book.
> 
> It's a conspiracy theory. The thesis is that the ""mainstream media"" coordinates to try to control people's lives. Then they try to support this wild assertion with case studies. Case studies are the worst sort of evidence for this! They detail special cases. It does not follow that special cases can imply a framework to explain anything like this conspiracy.
> 
> The authors seem to have done little if any relevant research. They make no mention of political science research. They do not discuss game theory. They, do not touch on the Prisoner's Dilemma, which dismantles their entire thesis. This dilemma discusses how multiple parties that want the same thing, act under uncertainty. Something relevant to a book discussing multiple media outlets coordinating in some moustache twirling plot to ""get"" the American people.
> 
> It provides few if any arguments to supports its thesis. As in, the reason they believe that these entities would conspire is that they ought to. This little gem is buried in a paragraph around the 200th page. There is no mention of it again. No supporting facts or research. No argument as to why one of the pillars of this conspiracy is true. Nothing. It's a bit like they're ashamed of how shabby the argument is and so make an effort to hide it. Indeed, they do this several times throughout the book.
> 
> The book seems to make a special effort to inflame the emotions of the reader. There are chapters full of analysis of why something is newsworthy or not. Distracting from the main issue that these chapters do little to support the thesis. I believe they may be there to distract from the lack of substance. These chapters are book-ended by silly assertions that they follow their propaganda model. As if a simple ""and so it is"" is a sufficient argument for anyone! These chapters are armchair reporting rather than any coherent critique.
> 
> These authors are not journalists and do not offer a fair critique of journalism. They take media outlets to task for failing to report ""newsworthy"" items. They make no mention of a definition of ""newsworthy"", whatever that is. They instead pour through the minutiae of a story they have chosen to make an example of. Citing reports and analysis of the situation. This neglects the fact that the people doing the reporting would not have access to the materials the authors do. That is, from their comfortable position after the fact, the authors critique journalists for their failure of not knowing the future. They tacitly assume that journalism is easy. A simple explanation for the neglect they complain about, is that the journalists just didn't know they information that the authors do. It's likely very difficult to know stories will be ""important"", except in retrospect. The authors are not journalists and make no effort to get their side of the story. They simply complain and critique, while ignoring their thesis.
> 
> The book in fact highlights an alternate reason for the behaviour they complain about that requires no conspiracy. Journalists may just do what is easy, like any person would. They cannot investigate every story. For example, right now a murder is being committed. A murder seems newsworthy. But so many journalists will miss it. Why? Because they don't know about it. They are not omniscient. Even if in the future the murder was important, there's no reasonable way to know now. The authors would penalize you or I for doing this. Just because in the future it was known it was important.
> 
> Another alternative to the conspiracy is just racism. Many Boomers are racist and so may not care about brown people. Many of the examples cited in this book about media outlet not reporting newsworthy items are related to people of colour. For instance, the book makes a comparison between news items in two countries. One in Europe and one in Central America. The European story gets attention, while the Central American one does not. A simple explanation is racism. If the Boomers who buy the media don't like to read about people of colour, then the reporting will tend to skew away from it. The authors make no mention of this pressure of ""what sells"". They deride the media for not paying attention to what they think is important, with no mention of economic factors. They do not consider simpler reasons for the behaviour they dislike. They focus on how the media must be evil.
> 
> This sort of argument that is bound up in emotion, hides its silly arguments, and complains without basis is the hallmark of propaganda. Ironically enough, this book reads like Fox News or some other propaganda outlet. Just as Fox News reports lies and half-truths for money, I'm left to wonder if this book does too. Did you see what that sentence did? It pointedly did not say what it was intended to. It implied. It left it to the imagination of the reader. It requires no argument, because it's meant to plant the seed of doubt in your mind. This book does that in spades. It implies when it should state. It guesses when it should be factual. It does not say much, because it cannot. It has no factual basis for these statement, and so it must imply them to the reader. The hate is palpable.
> 
> The authors come across as racist towards the United States government and the media. The circular logic, the rage, and the hatred in this book. It seeks to establish evil in its targets whatever the cost. Damn logic or evidence, they know what the answer is and they'll go through any lengths to prove.
> 
> Also, a simple question that completely dismantle the thesis: How is this book published if the evil overlords of media won't allow the truth to get out? The author provides no argument as to why the mainstream media would conspire this way, except that they're evil. If we believe the argument of the book, then the book would not have been published. It is only if the argument does not hold that the book can be published.
> 
> The chapters are long diatribes against some the crappier special cases in modern American history. Each ended with sentences of the kind: ""...and I saw this all along because of my model which I will not explain or support in any way."" These silly little things give the appearance of having said something, when nothing has.

eiey6j|2020-01-01 06:09:28|Just finished Eye of The World by Robert Jordan! (Review)|"So i kind of went overboard and this became a review, sorry for the length but I appreciate anyone who reads!


So after 10 or so years without reading a real, physical book I have finally come back and read this book in full! Over my life I have owned the book 3 times since childhood. Finally, as my first real book in 10, hell maybe more years, it is done.

I have to admit early here that it took some extra effort on my part, some forced continuation and truthfully I had wanted to give up, the story seemed to DRAG so heavily. It took I believe near 200 pages for things to really even start. 

What kept me going, other than some insistence from my mother, was the characters themselves. But three in particular.

Perrin, who goes on to be flat out one of the coolest characters by the end.

Lan, the stoic guardian and guide of the troupe.

And my favorite, Thom, the gleeman. I have always loved bards, and Thom is one of the best and coolest bard archetypes I've ever seen.

Rand as well was very interesting, the mystery surrounding him from very early on in the book kept me wanting to find out the truth, as little by little, details were revealed. Though, he did have a bit of a ""stereotype"" to him, I feel. That being the typical FATED HERO, even from very early on I kind of knew something big would happen with him.

The supporting characters were all quite good and interesting as well. From The Wandering People to the Green Man, everyone had their fitted place in the world. From legend to humble innkeeper, all had a spirit of life sewn into them by Jordan that was both believable and admirable.

The story itself is, in a way, very typical fantasy. The clash of good versus evil, light against dark. However, what saves it from being that typical fantasy, I feel, is again, all of the characters. In the main cast, aside from maybe Lan and Moiraine, the characters are truly human. Among a steady purpose, fear drives them on, there is no glory bound hero among the three boys, they do not seek an epic adventure to fight dragons and become kings. No. They RUN. Human emotions take over, not a sense of grandeur. This makes them more relatable, more set in reality than the actual genre you will find them under at your local book store.

The ending was satisfying, the big reveal, though kind of obvious from the start, held impact in how it was handled, I can tell you I was grinning the whole time reading the last few chapters.

I recommend it fully, with the warning that the beginning is quite slow, but the middle to end is amazing.

ei6luc|2019-12-31 18:19:38|Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes (Review/Notes) - A great fucking read|"No spoilers.
You know those books that seem like they’re one of the best you’ve read after you finish them? The books that have you thinking about them for days afterward? This one definitely checks those boxes. So much so that I needed to write this afterward.

Readability:

Not very long. About 300 pages, finished in 4-5 hours. Extremely gripping and definitely rereadable. Once I started this book, I could not put it down.

Writing Style:

Narrated as journal entries, chronological order. Usually in first person. A quirk in the narration is when the protagonist recalls himself as a child, it abrubtly switches to third person and the protagonist refers to himself by his full name (almost as another person with their own separate attributes, experience and personality.)

The language, however is simple and easy to read. It is not overly embellished, or as my dad says, 'flowery'. Unlike other classic books, not too many words are spent on description or setting (except for one or two instances that I can recall, such as a sex scene towards the end- this is a contrast to the books I typically read).

Not much incorporation of scientific explanation in the book. Although a major aspect of the plot had to do with the scientific method, experiments, research, IQ, publications, etc., it was brushed off and not given any explanation at all. For instance, when a discovery was being talked about, they were just explained like,""This was a new discovery involving whatever that would change humanity forever."" It was very surface level. I however, did not mind at all. Although scientific explanations and lingo are thoroughly enjoyed by me, it was not neccessary to the book, and would serve as an 'extra' rather than increasing the value/depth of the book itself.

Depth:
A very interesting aspect about description of events in this book is that they indicate the state of mind of the narrator. In this case, the clarity of thoughts and ability to comprehend and understand the depth behind events. Description of events goes from shallow and surface-level to deep and emotional (at which point truths about life and the human condition are talked about by the narrator). So this doubles as a character development technique, by playing with the way the character sees things.


Characters/Plot:

Like all good books,no matter how many negative qualities a character posessed, they were relatable, multi dimensional, and realistic, if not likeable.

The story itself was deceptively simple, but extremely well written. It was less of a story, and more of an experience/ inner workings of our protagonist’s mind, which is where it gets it's richness from.

Closure:

The ending was heartbreakingly realistic, which made it very satisfying. It was an ending well deserved by this book. 

Nothing was revealed as 'aftermath' or explanation for the ending. The ending was abrupt and jarring, making the book chronologically asymmetrical. However (surprisingly), this was welcome, as any good book demands some analysis, extrapolation and contemplation about the nature of human existence.

eiazke|2019-12-31 23:59:13|"It's taken me all year, but I finally finished ""Erebus: The Story of a Ship"" by Michael Palin"|"And it's not because I'm a slow reader - quite the contrary. But this was a book worth taking my time over.

I think it's mostly to do with the fact that I knew beforehand how the story of this remarkable ship ends, and I was putting off reading about the details.

Couple this with the wonderful and charming way in which Palin (of Monty Python fame) relayed the history of this ship (and its sister ship, *Terror*) from its birth in Pembroke Dock, to its expeditions at both ends of the world in the Royal Navy's golden age of polar exploration, and finally to its end (the details of which I'll leave out). I just didn't want the book to end. 

I highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in books about exploration and old ships. I'm glad it's my last read of 2019.

ei17oa|2019-12-31 10:29:07|Just read The Outsider (The Stranger) by Albert Camus|"**TLDR I'm just listing things I found interesting about this book and Mersault. I don't have a proper conclusion to this post. Still reading about the book. Hopefully someone can explain what this book is about. Or just comment anything!**

I feel quite indifferent about this book. I don't *like* it but I don't dislike it either.

Certain parts that were outstanding though: 
1. The fight scene got me pumped up. 
2. I expected a fight to get him in trouble, so when he killed, I was shocked. (Back of the book called it a ""random act of violence)
3. The announcement of his sentence hit really hard. I got the chills. Firstly, I love The Idiot, and there's a scene in which he explains a person's last few minutes before the guillotine. Secondly, my lecturer once said, ""No matter how many times you've heard it (in court), you will always get the chills when someone is sentenced to the gallows."" 
4. His outburst against the chaplain was so good. I read Meursault's lines so enraged, shouting throughout. That was an awesome scene. 
5. The particular line where he says, sometimes you wish that a person you love was dead. I know what that's like. It's not out of hate, but out of pain.

Now, for the philosophical part. Correct me if I am wrong. I think Mersault is meant to be the embodiment here of some philosophy. He didn't care much for his mother's death, not that he found it meaningless, but that he accepted it very easily. I think that's why he didn't cry. He was just too stoic about it. They say not to cry over spilled milk. Here's a guy who didn't but he was condemned for it. I mean, he did think of his mum, didn't he? I think he didn't stop loving her. 

Next, I admit that the 'absurdity' went over my head while reading the trial scenes. Only later I realised while reading about the book that the prosecutor and jury were harping way too much on his lack of apparent emotions towards his mother's death in comparison to the murder itself. The jury did not like that he did not display grief for his mother's death, and that made him a criminal. The trial was flawed. They were distracted by something apart from the ""unfortunate event"". It is as if I was one of the jury while still in the perspective of Mersault.

As for his lack of remorse towards killing the Arab man. I don't know guys. Maybe Mersault didn't care much for someone who followed them with a knife and tried to beat them up. Maybe he really just doesn't feel sorry for the man because there's nothing he knows about the man that he should be sorry for. But nobody asked him to explain this. Even his lawyer didn't ask him about this. This is no justification for a killing a person but it is a valid question here: how remorseful should he feel here about killing someone he knows as an adversary?? 

Alright, maybe some of you may not like a reference to Joker but it's recent, those who watched it surely remember it - he killed the 3 boys and didn't feel remorseful about it. He later said he found it funny. Reading between the lines, I think we can see that Joker/Arthur felt that his killing them was justified because they were the aggressors, and not just aggressors in that incident but potential aggressors just about anywhere (because they're 'the rich'). 

So... Mersault didn't show much remorse, he wasn't sorry for it and he didn't pretend that he was remorseful about it. He is... honest! He was honest to Marie when she asked if he loved her and whether he would marry her. He didn't pretend that he was remorseful. He just let the trial carry on. 

I'm sorry that I don't have a proper conclusion. I'm still reading about the book and about absurdism. Hopefully someone can shed some light and make this book clearer. I'm not sure what to take away from this."|DrNature96|False|https://redd.it/ei17oa|41|0.88|0|25|1|books

I know this was one of the highest rated books of the year and that is really making me question my opinions on it. 

Some of the reasons I didn't like the book were that I felt the two main characters, especially Theo were weak and allowed people in their lives to trample all over them, not especially a great quality for a psychotherapist. They both created these god like figures for their spouses and seemed to not be interested in anything but them.  I feel like the author put in a lot of things in the story that didn't seem to come to fruition or seemed they were just were put in to try and throw you off.  

There were a few other things that bothered me in the story and since I took notes while reading (I like to incase I need to recall something) I can see the progression of my dissppointment.

(Though the entries from the period where he was banned from seeing the Liddell family have mysteriously disappeared) I feel I can’t continue to read these books and will never feel the same way about them again. I loved the Disney movie as a child and have redacted versions that I’ve read my own daughter. I’m disgusted. How is this not more widely known. You can’t separate the art from the artist in this instance as the book is about Alice!

eibgs7|2020-01-01 00:36:33|Randomizer Reviews: Herzog by Saul Bellow|"Greetings, adventurers, and welcome to The Randomizer. This is the first time I have posted a review on r/books, so I suspect there will be some new readers here. The Randomizer is a book reading/reviewing project I started in order to help decide what to read next, and to increase my breadth of reading. A program I wrote parses my to-be-read list, selects something at random, and it is then my task to read it and share my thoughts. As an avid fantasy fan, this has been the domain of r/fantasy thus far. However, this most recent book is a piece of realistic fiction, and the moderators said they preferred I not dilute the focus of their sub when I asked and so requested I do not post my review there. And so, I have migrated! From now on I will most likely crosspost to both subreddits assuming it is applicable to both.

&#x200B;

Now, with the introduction out of the way, let us waste no more time. The book I have read is Herzog, by Saul Bellow.

&#x200B;

Moses Elkanah Herzog is a man who has made some mistakes. Forty-seven years and two divorces into his life, he finds himself unsure how to proceed. Frantically writing unsent letters to deal with his neuroses, Moses navigates his confusing world, his friends, his enemies, and his past, trying to find his way in life.

&#x200B;

You may notice that that summary is very short and didn't really say much of anything. To be honest, I'm at something of a loss to try and say what the book is actually about, beyond ""It's about Moses Herzog"". The plot, such as it is, is told in a non-linear order reminiscent of Pulp Fiction (though predating the movie by quite some time), scenes fading in and out as the titular character becomes lost in thought thinking about the past, flitting from month to month and going all the way back to Moses' childhood at points. The book opens with him sitting on a couch thinking about his life, and I spent over half the book erroneously thinking that the entire story was framed around him reminiscing while on that couch. None of the real events of the story matter that much in the end. It's about the character, and exploring his mind - the mind of a real jerk, as it turns out. Moses Herzog is not a very good person. An unfaithful husband, a narcissist with anger management issues... He had self awareness of his character, but I didn't feel he took any steps to actually try and improve himself throughout.

&#x200B;

I remember reading about ten pages in, and being struck with a premonition - I'm not going to understand this book, am I? I will close the book on the final page and think to myself, ""Okay, so what was the actual point of that?"", and have no answer. The book will be an eternal classic - I know it is - but it will all be lost on me in the end, deemed as meaningless and having no point.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, I was mostly correct. Not completely, but if there was something deeper to this book I barely grasped it. Bellow is a recommendation from my father, whose favorite books are steeped in east coast Judaism (Philip Roth, Chaim Potok, and Michael Chabon are all authors he enjoys). This book is no exception, extraordinarily intertwined with 1960s reform Judaism down to the character's name (though not his practice for the most part - as a Jew myself I remember blinking twice when Moses ate shrimp). Characters occasionally converse in Yiddish, Hebrew prayers are referenced numerous times, and the locations and philosophies of east coast Jews are on full display. Herzog is very much a book of its place and time. So much so, in fact, that it loses a lot of its meaning if you aren't already familiar with its context. There were countless references to people, places, and ideas that were utterly lost on me and likely would be on anyone else who grew up in the new millennium. I had to repeatedly stop and ask my father to help me understand a theme or a person that Bellow clearly assumed his readers would already be familiar with.

&#x200B;

I suppose it is no surprise, then, that when the book dropped much of this in favor of a more linear narrative for the last quarter or so, I felt it a great improvement. I joked that the book would somehow have an exciting and satisfying climax, just before reaching the point where it actually kind of did. With the backstory more or less complete, it shifted to Moses in the present, with little in medias res to be found, and continued that way for most of the remaining book. I found this to be much better than the preceding portions, in part because the actual events were more interesting and in part because I could actually tell what happened when at last. I caught a glimpse of actual meaning here, even, though actually describing it eludes me at the moment.

&#x200B;

There is one issue that occurred in that portion, however. Spoilers follow, but also a NSFW content warning.

&#x200B;

>!Near the end of the book, it is revealed that Moses was raped as a child by some pedophile who caught him on a street corner. This comes out of absolutely nowhere. It has one piece of foreshadowing in the entire book that I can recall, and even that was quite possibly just the book's dated values coming through. It is discussed for about three paragraphs and is never brought up again. It tells us nothing about the character, does not inform any decisions made at any point throughout any of the book, and ultimately is absolutely and utterly pointless.!<

&#x200B;

It's hard to tell what is bad writing in this book, and what is simply foreign writing to me. Much of the prose was unusual to my eyes but it wasn't bad, just a different style than what I am used to. The same goes for the non-linear narrative structure and the unfamiliar setting. In the case spoilered above, however, I stand firm. That is simply awful storytelling.

&#x200B;

On the other side of the 371 pages, then, what are my final thoughts? I don't really know, to be honest. Herzog is Herzog. It's an excellent book, at least I'm pretty sure it is. I learned some about the culture of 1961, a full 59 years ago by the time this review is posted and around three lifetimes ago for me. I don't regret reading it. I don't want my time back. I enjoyed it, more or less. But I also wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Its time is past, sadly, and I think it lacks the timeless nature of a true classic. In another 59 years I wonder if it will even be comprehensible. If you are determined to read Herzog having read my review, I certainly encourage it. However, if you're on the fence, even a little bit, I wouldn't bother. Saul Bellow is henceforth removed from the list, as I feel no desire to read any of his other books past this one. That's a real shame.

&#x200B;

(Quick note - the list online does not get updated for a few days or longer - what is used and updated in real time is my personal offline copy, which I periodically use to update the online one.)

&#x200B;

Speaking of the list, however, it is time to see what next I shall read. Let us see here...

&#x200B;

(several rerolls due to unavailability at the library later...)

&#x200B;

*Your choice has been made. You have been granted...City of Saints and Madmen*

&#x200B;

Well, this one is actually not available either - but other books by the author, Jeff VanderMeer, are. I will update the list to replace this entry with the author rather than the book, and I will next read Area X - the full Southern Reach Trilogy released throughout 2014. I know nothing of this, and haven't the faintest what it might be.

&#x200B;

Whatever the case, I hope to see you all there when that review is complete, for the next entry of The Randomizer!

I’ve recently finished this book. I found it to be awful. Setting aside all the scientology discussion that usually comes any mention of L. Ron Hubbard, can anyone point out some redeeming qualities to this book? Did I miss something? It took me nearly two years to read it, because I had to put it down many, many times to read something better. It just seemed that of the myriad of situations the main character faced, he always had the perfect solution to his conflicts. The protagonist manages to save the day time and again through either luck or help from his compatriots because they knew that’s what Johnny Goodboy Tyler would want.  In addition, the characters were so mundane and generalized. The Scots did this... The Russians did this.... The Chinese did this... Weirder  yet the Chinese were so completely anachronistic. They were based on the Qing Dynasty that ended in 1911. The whole plot was based on banking and mining. Each of these was rather poorly explained but had some sort of overarching governance. But the various races / aliens had to follow the rules just because. Sadly, I fail to see the significance of this work. Other than the fact that it was written by the leader of a “Religion,” I don’t feel like it’s very good at all.

Likewise Agnes is treated like a mistake Tom thinks he made despite him claiming he loves her.

ei9ptr|2019-12-31 22:16:36|"Should I finish reading Jane Eyre? Do you read for ""self-betterment?"""|"I set a personal goal to read a series of books from a college course I never got to take (the professor's sabbatical unfortunately coincided with my senior year). I just finished *Middlemarch*, and loved it, but I am HATING *Jane Eyre*. The world building is so gratingly adolescent, everything from the characterization of the Reeds to her perspective of Mr. Rochester. (OK: we can argue that ""that's the point because Jane is young and it's from her POV""--but that doesn't make it a pleasant read for me).  

In general, I put down a boring book. When it's a ""classic,"" it becomes more complicated for me. It reminded me of this thread, where someone asked if [they should read the classics](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5pvmwv/should_i_read_classics_even_if_i_dont_enjoy_them/) even if they don't enjoy them. One user suggested that you might read for ""self-betterment,"" or well-roundedness, if you really take reading seriously as a practice. 

I've been thinking a lot about this concept because although it's a standard I unconsciously abide by, when we discipline ourselves to read for self-betterment, it implies there is something inherently bettering about ""classics"" in a canon curated along lines of both privilege and chance. It's not that I won't read something challenging or dull (I have), but *Jane Eyre* is really stumping me as falling into the ""self-betterment"" category because a lot of the ideas encapsulated in the storyline are actually [really racist](https://lithub.com/reading-jane-eyre-while-black/), and frankly, I find the overall feminist moral arch of the story outdated. So it's hard for me to categorize this pleasureless read as ""self-betterment"" in any moral, philosophical, or spiritual way. 

One book won't make or break me as a reader or a person. But I'm interested in other people's take on what it means to read for self-betterment. Is that moral betterment? Cultural betterment?

Chapters that I felt were slogs at a teenager that took me days to read are things I now read with vigor. It took weeks to get through Tom Bombadil's chapter in 2000, only for me to blaze through it in one sitting in 2019.

ehomrf|2019-12-30 17:02:01|Looking for a New Year's Resolution? Join us in reading Middlemarch at A Year of Middlemarch!|"Hello All!

There are a handful of people interested in reading Middlemarch by George Eliot so I decided to make the subreddit!  The book is just shy of 800 pages and made up of 80 chapters.  We'll be reading about 2 chapters a week with a break in the summer to catch up.  The exact schedule is posted on the sidebar of r/ayearofmiddlemarch.

A little bit about Middlemarch:

>**Middlemarch, A Study of Provincial Life** is a novel by the English author George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans), appearing in eight installment in 1871 and 1872. Set in a fictitious Midlands town from 1829 to 1832, it follows distinct, intersecting stories with many characters. Issues include the status of women, the nature of marriage, idealism, self-interest, religion, hypocrisy, political reform, and education. Despite comic elements, Middlemarch uses realism to encompass historical events: the 1832 Reform Act, early railways, and the accession of King William IV. It views contemporary medicine and examines reactionary views in a settled community facing unwelcome change. Eliot began writing the two pieces that would form the novel in 1869–1870 and completed it in 1871. Initial reviews were mixed, but it is now seen widely as her best work and one of the great novels in English. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlemarch)

It's supposed to be very funny!  And I love that a woman wrote it under a male pseudonym.  It's so rare to find a female written classic novel with such acclaim that has little to do with romance.  The book has been collecting dust on my shelf for over 10 years and it's time to rectify that.  So please join me in reading Middlemarch!

The ceilings are high and not only are there sleek computers and a lab full of laptops, but a 3-D printer. There's an entire room dedicated to young adult books. The first thing I saw was a sign encouraging me to check out a telescope. Not only do they have two community rooms, but a ""creativity room"" too, with sewing machines and looms and screen printing tools.

I sat in a comfortable chair which was free of stains and rips. It was next to a self-checkout machine, which was easier to use than the ones at any grocery store. 

I got kind of emotional this morning, thinking about how libraries are the kindest human invention. The library is a safe haven, a place so full of resources I can't name them all off the top of my head. A team of people built this library and filled it with things for my community, just like a different team of people built this library's predecessor."|carawins|False|https://redd.it/eh8vgl|4691|0.96|5|137|1|books

ehpaki|2019-12-30 17:48:16|Haunted by the children's book The House Across the Street by Jules Feiffer|"This weekend, I took my young kids to the library and picked up a big stack of books. There was one, ""The House Across the Street,"" that is going to stick with me, even though I'm not sure if I could recommend it.

The narrator is a little boy who is envious of the imagined wonderful life of the boy across the street who lives in a big, beautiful house ""where it's better than here."" It's a combination of elements that are at least somewhat realistic (he's a little older, he has four dogs), little kids' fantasies (he's got a pet shark in a swimming pool in his room, he doesn't have to go to school if it's raining), and the frankly material (his family goes on vacation every year, his parents ""love him so much!"" and show it by ordering all the stuff he wants).  And some of it plainly reveals the unhappiness and loneliness of the narrator: their family laughs a lot and never yells, and the boys has a huge group of friends, and is all of his friend's best friend. 

Most of this has a familiar rhythm to those who read a lot of children's books. I expected it to end with some kind of lesson. Maybe there would be the revelation that the boy across the street doesn't actually have all these things; maybe he had similar fantasies about the narrator.  Instead, it ends as follows:

>We don't go away, except for a week, or when we're invited, but when we're not, which is most of the time...  
>  
>I go across the street.  
>  
>I walk back and forth in front of the house. I'm not hurting anything.  
>  
>Sometimes I knock on the door. I know he's not there.  
>  
>I just pretend he is.  
>  
>I pretend he invites me in. We become friends.  
>  
>Some nights I sleep over.

And the last page is an overhead shot of the boys smiling and watching TV in an absurdly large mansion that is wildly out of place in a dense neighborhood. No lesson, no resolution, just a wistful fantasy.

Amazon and Goodreads hate this book. I don't know if I've ever seen a 1 1/2 star average for a book on Amazon. They say it's teaching kids to be materialistic, to be stalkers, or just that it's boring.

But I dunno. While my kids (3 and 4) can take it or leave it, I wonder if it would be helpful for a kid in a house with a lot of shouting, who envies the lives of their wealthier classmates. It might be nice for them to hear that they're not crazy and their feelings are valid. I don't know that it's really a book for kids at all; it's more a book about childhood, for adults, disguised as a kids book.

ehru6k|2019-12-30 20:45:09|Frustrations In Fiction|"Hey All,

For Christmas Break, my AP English Lang teacher was kind enough to give us only a short novella to read, *The Heart of Darkness* by Joseph Conrad. He only wanted us to read one of the sections of it and answer whatever 5 questions we wanted in a doc he gave us. Today I had some time to sit up in my bed, turn on insight timer, and just relax. There was a problem, however.

As soon as I read a sentence and went on to the next one, I find myself failing to try to remember stuff I just read a second ago(typically the reason that gets me away from reading books in the first place). It took me a solid 15 minutes to get through the first few pages, and I had trouble remembering what I just read. 

If it helps, also, I do a lot more with technology than reading books, whether it's playing games, doing music production or video editing, or hardware tinkering. I rarely read unless it's a school assignment. 

Is my lack of reading at fault here, or am I just a poor reader by nature?

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated

ehe9jr|2019-12-30 00:33:17|After a couple of years of not reading, I’ve read a book a day since Christmas|"I used to read more than any other kid I’d ever met, but I gradually stopped reading for fun— I had a bunch of books that looked interesting, but ended up putting me to sleep when I tried to read them. I would read maybe 5 books a year for fun (not counting re-reads).

 But now I’ve read 5 books in the past 5 days. I know it doesn’t mean I’ll be able to keep this habit up, but I’ve proved to myself that I can do it. Once I start a book, I can’t stop it. My New Year’s resolution is to read more, and I think this is a good start :)


edit: I’ve read The Handmaid’s Tale, The Night Circus, and then 3 fast easy books (that were all probably 300-400 pages). I just wanted to read a couple of books that looked like entertaining, light reads to help me build up a habit of reading more before I tackle the ones that have been sitting on my bookshelf for years (Demons, i’m looking at you).

I’m also a really REALLY fast reader, I’m on winter break, and no I’m not skimming. I guess I can’t prove that on the internet, but I wouldn’t just spend hours skimming a book instead of actually reading it, just to brag on reddit. because 1) nobody would care and 2) that would be a waste of my own time.

ehjov7|2019-12-30 08:56:49|Just finished The Testaments by Margaret Atwood and I was wondering what everyone thought of it. (Because I have a pretty strong opinion)|"I LOVED The Handmaid’s Tale, especially the ambiguity of the story (especially as her writing style is “speculative fiction” that could happen anywhere if we’re not careful). I believe that it’s a cautionary tale and it’s so powerful because it’s a timeless classic, and it doesn’t rely on specific time or place. I also love how Handmaids evoked such a discomfort while reading it, because I believe that is what the story is meant to do. However, Testaments left me feeling kinda empty.

I was really interested in seeing how Gilead came about from the perspectives of Aunt Lydia, a young girl born into that society, as well as an outsider who is not assimilated into that culture. I found the exposition side of the story, as well as the depth into the “world building” of Gilead really intriguing, however I found that the plot and the characters felt too obvious, and almost forced. Because of that, it fell flat in my opinion and I don’t think the book did the Handmaids Tale justice. Life doesn’t get wrapped up in a nice fairy tale happy ending bow. There are loose ends. There’s ambiguity. And that’s part of why Handmaids was so unbelievably powerful because there are still questions that are left unanswered, just like life.

ehlh8u|2019-12-30 12:27:37|Anyone find The Witcher series overrated? (Spoilers)|"Edit: I write all that just to be downvoted, I'm guessing because people disagree?

I've finished the first 5 (Last Wish, Sword of Destiny, Blood of Elves, Times of Contempt and Baptism of Fire)

They have their moments, I particularly like the episodic nature of the first two books / short story collections, but they weren't perfect.

I find the whole destiny / child surprise narrative to be incredibly force. I guess Destiny is something people in this world truly believe (and is perhaps real), but that doesn't mean I like it. It just feels like a cheap way to set up the Geralt / Ciri relationship. They hardly know each other but behave like they have a deep bond so quickly. It's the main thing driving Geralt's actions and it's so hard to accept.

The same goes for Geralt and Yen. Their relationship seems incredibly immature and toxic. Reminds me of a teenagers idea of love. Geralt turns into an embarrassing and moody schoolboy around Yen. I guess the wish is the reason for this, they're not meant to or would have had a relationship if not for it, but it's a painfully embarrassing and, frankly, boring relationship to read.

Some of the dialogue is quite bad too. This is mostly in the first to books. Characters would have these awkwardly worded conversations, or monologue at another character. I might be less lazy and edit this with a few examples down the track. 

The story has its moments where it grips me, but then just managed to be immensely boring for the most part. The beats are fine, but it just somehow seems to unravel so slowly. At the end of Times of Contempt I was shocked how little has happened in 600+ pages between the first two of the pentology.

Geralt has borderline anti-plot armour. For our super powered mutant he sure gets his ass kicked a lot. This wouldn't be a problem, except we see him pull of some absurd feats at other times. It'd be like watching Muhammad Ali lose every 3rd fight to a hobo.

I guess a minor complaint given how frequently this occurs in fantasy, but magic is so OP yet the characters underutilize it like crazy. They use spell Y when spell X could have worked ten times better. Teleporting seems to be forgotten from time to time. A really simply example of conjuring food. They do it so effortlessly. They could just conjure a ham sandwich to appear in anyones throat to kill them, instead they used slow ranged spells that can be dodged. A mage blinds Geralt effortlessly. Why didn't any other mage just blind any other non magic attacker in combat. Should be your go to opener. It's like in Star Trek where they solve a problem with some new tech, then it never comes up again.

Lastly, the best part of the first two books, Geralt HUNTING MONSTERS is pretty much removed from the pentology (so far). I guess it would hurt the pacing, but it's a shame, it was kind of like Sherlock Holmes short stories but with monsters instead. Fun to read.

ehfhm1|2019-12-30 02:11:17|Thoughts on Rubicon:The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic by Tom Holland|"\-First, I would be remiss if I failed to recommend Hardcore History, a podcast by Dan Carlin. This is where I first heard of Tom Holland with his texts constantly being referenced. I cannot advocate enough for Hardcore History, it's absolutely fantastic.

\- As far as snapshots into history go, Rubicon was phenomenal. Rome in the 100's-60's B.C. was a breeding ground for giants. Larger than life figures in the Senate, and the battlefield loomed and defended, or jeopardized, a sacred Republic really only glimpsed previously in Greece. Holland does an admirable job remaining unbiased, but I could not help but feel aligned with certain characters for either their courage, or their wit. Caesar is undeniably the lead, but the names of Cicero, Cato, Pompey, Sulla, Crassus, Caesar Augustus, Clodius, Gaius goddamn Marius, Mark Antony, the Sibyl, Cleopatra, Mithridates...and on and on.. so many fantastic figures and events to be analyzed and remembered. I encourage all lovers of stories to seek out ancient Rome, and read about these legends.

\-The Rubicon itself was a creek north of Rome, where it was said, generals had to relinquish their legions before crossing, as a symbol they would not march on Rome herself, ""the Mistress of the World"". I imagine what it was like for Sulla, but even more so Caesar, when that moment came in which each decided in their hearts to march on the Republic, and cross that river. I picture Caesar's gaze on the flowing waters, as the moonlight shone off its surface, reflecting on all that was at stake. Democracy vs. Dictatorship, Freedom vs. Power. For it was Caesar's march and subsequent tyranny that proved the death knell of the Republic, and a civil war that began to topple Rome. I can't imagine the magnitude of that moment on even a giant like Julius Caesar, and the perilousness of such a minor maneuver. Such a small moment with ramifications felt throughout the rest of world history. Awesome.

\-I often wonder the benefits of authoritarianism vs democracy as it relates to Rome. With the Republic, power was shared through dual consuls, a tribunate, praetors, questors, the Senate, priests and so on. A glory-thirsty people vied for power, and contentions, and rivalries were constant. Speeches and trials at the Senate House were public spectacles, as were elections. Rome had a very real class system, and the poor were still inferior in the Republic. But, every man had the opportunity to make a name for himself, and gain honors for his household. Yet, it was usually dictators who subdued a people into peace, such as the rule of Caesar Augustus. I guess, in the end, a contentious band of free men trump that of the peaceful slave. 

\- In reading Rubicon, I often desired just to be a face in the Roman crowd during some of these legendary times. To feel the fears upon defeats to Mithridates and Hannibal, to the jubilations of the triumphs of Pomey and Caesar. To see Gaius Marius deflect the Germans and steal consulship and command from Sulla. To see the horror of Sulla's march on Rome. To listen to the great Cicero orate in the Forum, or the steadfast Cato condemn the triumverate. To jeer with the prejudiced Romans as Cleopatra, the Queen of Macedonia and Egypt, and mistress to Caesar (and later Mark Antony), enters the sacred Republic. So many unbelievable moments. I'd love to have a taste of the emotions of the common, everyday Roman during these times.

\-Caesar was without peer in the end. His accomplishments were many, and all enormous. He pacified all of Gaul in a gallic holocaust. He was captured by pirates, released, and returned to hang them all. He sailed to England, previously a land of myth. He marched on Rome. He defeated the great Pompey. He subdued the east, specifically Alexandria. He ruined the Republic and became pretty much a god-like figure. The descendant of Venus amazes throughout Roman history, and it's honestly a tall task to find historical figures that match his life. The great Cato was his rival, yet I felt in the end, the fact that Cato could never wrestle power from Caesar, made him the loser in the feud over the Republic. I'd love to hear others thoughts on this.

\-Ultimately, if you are a fan of history at all as I am, Rubicon is excellent. Tom Holland writes in an easy to read manner, and the spirits of the figures from italy speak for themselves. I never felt a dull moment in this read, and he does a great job of giving you the flavors of the masses in these times. I'll be reading his texts on Persia soon, but for now it has been a great experience and honor delving into the Republic.

""Confident that he was among friends, Caesar dropped his guard. 'What is the sweetest kind of death?' he was asked. Back shot Caesar's response: 'The kind that comes without warning.' To be warned was to be fearful; to be fearful was to be emasculated. That night, when Caesar's wife suffered nightmares and begged him not to attend the Senate the next day, he laughed. In the morning, borne in his litter, he caught sight of the soothsayer who had told him to beware the Ides of March. 'The day of which you warned me against is here,' Caesar said smiling, 'and I am still alive.' 'Yes,' came the answer, swift and and inevitable. 'It is here- but it is not yet past.'

ehg64v|2019-12-30 03:08:57|just finished 11/22/63|"okay so i just finished up 11/22/63 and wow i have a lot of thoughts that i would be interested to see if anyone can relate to.

first off i loved it. the only parts of the book that didnt have me completely engulfed in the story where the parts on Oswald. i understand that a huge part of this book is about Jake/George spying on Oswald and saving JFK but i found my eyes just scanning over the paragraphs were he is spying on his family and the stuff about the attempted Walker assassination.

i did however LOVE all the stuff about Jake's life in Jodie, and not just the stuff with Sadie. i loved the play and how he changed Mike Coslaw and Bobbi-Jill and his relationship with Deke and Ellen and Mimi. how he got Jim DaLue to stop drinking. just all the little stuff was so great. but here's what kinda sucks about this, it was all for nothing. so when Jake goes back to 2011 after saving Kennedy the world is a shit hole, so literally none of it mattered. i also hated how rushed the future part was. we spend the entire book building up to changing the future then get to spend no time in it. just a couple of pages of some random facts from Harry? i was so sad about this i wanted to know more about what happened to the future. and i wish he looked up his old friends and found out what happened to them. i wanted to know what became of Ellen Dockerty and Deke and his old student Mike. i also wanted to know more about how Sadie was viewed as a public hero throughout the years and the conspiracy theories about Jake. idk i just felt like there should have been sooo much more at the end. 

lastly i liked the final scene, people say it's heartbreaking and sad but you have to think, Sadie is alive and is surrounded by so many people that she loves and is loved by. and Jake and Sadie get to have that dance together. the saddest part about it is he's not just leaving behind the women he loves but he's leaving behind a life he loves. all of his students and best friends are now gone with the past. i liked this ending however there is another ending that King was going to use. the premise of it is Jake looks Sadie up in the future and finds out that she married a wealthy guy and has many kids and grandchildren of her own. which ending do you think is better? i really like how old Sadie and Jake get to meet up in the future but i think the original ending is happier for Sadie."|badv1besonly|False|https://redd.it/ehg64v|10|0.67|0|10|1|books

ehbdje|2019-12-29 20:55:27|Not understanding the hype around Blood Meridian|"I just finished Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy, and it left me feeling greatly underwhelmed. None of the characters felt fleshed out, and the plot seemed aimless. Perhaps the later was intentional, so I’d be willing to give it a pass, but nothing else about the story hooked me. The prose was good, but prose is one of the things I care least about in literature (at least compared to character and plot). 

I’ve read The Road and didn’t feel this same level of ambivalence; in fact, I quite liked that one. And while I’ve only seen the film version of No Country for Old Men, it showed me that McCarthy can create interesting storylines and characters. Yet I’ve heard from many people on this subreddit and in real life that Blood Meridian is one of McCarthy’s best books, but it didn’t manage to make me feel anything.

eh86oz|2019-12-29 16:55:02|my take on the disturbing book unintended consequences by John Ross|This book is a disturbing piece of libertarian pro terrorism propaganda. I’ll start with saying it’s unusually well written. The author is extremely good at helping the reader visualize what’s going on and taking you through the entire life of the main characters, even though it’s his first book.*spoilers* Basically this book is about a army brat kid who has lived in a way higher standard of living than almost all Americans. He seems to be completely unaware his life is completely different than most people, and is socially isolated into his little disenfranchised bubble of gun culture. He has an obsession with shooting hundreds of thousands of rounds though expensive guns, on his ridiculously huge amount of private land that almost no one else has. He flies a private plane he owns for his own fun. He goes to Africa and shoots an elephant and other large animals. Yet he thinks somehow most Americans are living his life. He becomes more and more upset about gun laws that occur over the years , and eventually becomes a domestic terrorist murdering  police and public officials. The book seems to imply this is a good thing, and something all gun owners in his “gun culture” should do.  Honestly I don’t see why the government hasn’t banned it, because it’s literally designed to tip gun nuts over the edge to the point of committing mass murder.|Shrocklover|False|https://redd.it/eh86oz|6|1.0|0|8|1|books
egucn4|2019-12-28 18:39:39|Today I read ‘Voices of Chernobyl’.....|"I have always been fascinated with disasters. Chernobyl was one of the disasters that I, as a child, spent hours reading on Encarta and on the internet whenever I got the chance. A badly-made, low-budget horror movie that I watched, which took place at Chernobyl, made me curious about the incident even further. The movie was bad and had nothing to do with the actual Chernobyl disaster, but the scenery of Chernobyl portrayed in the movie intrigued me.

Fast forward to 2019, HBO’s Chernobyl TV shoe rekindled my curiosity, answered a lot of questions I had since I was a child and introduced new questions. I went on an online quest; reading anything and everything that I could find about the disaster and diving deeper into finding out how a catastrophe of this magnitude could’ve occurred. But, all of those articles, documentaries, and books I read failed to capture one thing; the feelings of those who affected by the disaster.

Today I read ‘Voices of Chernobyl’ by Svetlana Alexievich. This book does what any other book, movie or documentary about Chernobyl disaster couldn’t do. This book captures those feelings and emotions; pain, grief, fear, and most of all love.

It’s heartbreaking to see how all of these people were affected by a disaster that could’ve been avoided and at the very least been controlled post-incident. The negligence of the government, the ineptitude of the bureaucrats and the ignorance of all of those who were responsible meant that everything that could’ve been done to minimize damage, wasn’t done effectively or wasn’t done at all. It’s amazing to hear about all those who volunteered to stay in the exclusion zone or go there to help the efforts, knowing that their lives wouldn’t be the same afterward.

I’m looking to set some reading goals for 2020. I’m new to reading and don’t want to be too overwhelmed with reading. Any sort of tips will be helpful! 
I also have two very specific questions when it comes to reading.

Firstly, do you set goals such as “I will read 20 pages a day, so I will finish the book on (enter date)” ? 

Secondly, do you use an app to track the progress of the book you are reading and previous books you have read? I’m looking for an app where I can know how close I am to finishing/how many pages to go and also see what books I’ve read in the past.

ehit8g|2019-12-30 07:14:12|"Am I reading ""real"" literature?"|"I'll try my best to make this post brief. I recently picked up a few Stephen King books and I'm halfway through one of them, and I'm enjoying it.

This literary fiction versus genre fiction debate is all very new to me, since I'm a beginner. Apparently, according to critics like the late Harold Bloom, there's nothing that young people like myself can really get out of books like Harry Potter, which he notoriously went into, and out of authors like Stephen King, who he also went into back in 2003.

I have to say, especially as an amateur, it's discouraging to hear that from someone who most definitely is not an amateur. Of course, this isn't mathematics or physics and Bloom's opinion is just that - an opinion. But it's also not nothing. I'm entertained by these books (especially mystery and thriller ones) and that should be enough. At the same time, I'd like to ask you guys if you could at least help me understand Bloom's (and many others like him) point. Do authors such as King not employ sophisticated enough prose? Do their books not comment sufficiently on some important aspect of society? And for these reasons, they're not ""serious""?

I know the line is blurred and that literary and genre fiction often cross paths, but I'm assuming there's some important difference between them that these critics see."|HorrorMode|False|https://redd.it/ehit8g|0|0.42|0|20|1|books

I keep examining horror books I've read this year, alongside thrillers, and realize that they rely on the same themes and concepts.

A sense of suspense all the way through. A fear of the antagonist, whether it's the evil clown in a horror or the serial killer in a thriller. And the fear that is eventually overcome and put away.

I don't mean to sound like some ""macho man"" but it's hard for books to scare me, period. I keep reading recommendation after recommendation of books that allegedly give nightmares but have not met any nightmares as of yet. 

Horror books aren't horrifying to me, they are THRILLING. Because the techniques and narrative the author uses that is intended to incite fear just ends up gripping me and pulling me in. As such, I find horror authors more better at thrilling me than James Patterson or Lee Child ever will. 

I read horror novels because to me, they are thrillers. The writing designed to scare a human preys on primal fears and allows the novel to be more immersive, the writing to be sharper.

I've never been able to answer, definitively, what period of literature I enjoy most. But, I realized, today, that Victorian literature (mainly British at the moment), really hooks me in a way other periods simply do not. Particularly writing style. I might be an anomaly amongst readers in that I am most curious about the technical aspects of writing: arrangement, sentence structure, paragraph structure, and the like. I am secondarily concerned with plot, and *then*...characters. Yikes! I'm sure I've blasphemed the gospel of many here though this isn't my intent. I've never felt the connection to characters the same way most readers I know, do. That being said, the long flowing sentences of Victorian authors/literature is a dream to me (eg Dickens -- finally finished *Great Expectations* a couple of months ago). I adore it. And, I adore the slowness of Victorian novels (and earlier Western novels in general). In a culture where everything (including novels) seems to move quickly and more quickly, the slowness is refreshing. Moreover, they house such interesting words that I have not often found in contemporary literature. Though, I'll admit, I'm not well-versed in much passed the 60s EXCEPT Harry Potter...of course. Anyway, just wanted drop a line with a few thoughts. I'll close with a comment intentionally pointed at character and connection: Tess is a mere sixteen years old (if I've calculated correctly) and I'm struck by her level-headedness. I find that I very much resonate with her as the solitary head of reason in her family. LOL|EJ87|False|https://redd.it/egvvgu|39|0.84|0|24|1|books

Tessa had no real motive. Lucinda has more motive than her for goodness sake.

egut8x|2019-12-28 19:15:33|Lets talk about one of those other Dumas novels, in this case: The Black Tulip|"The Black Tulip set in 1672-1673 in the Netherlands right before Johan the Witt, the Dutch Grand Pensionary, and his brother Cornelius de Witt are lynched by an angry mob (which takes place in the first couple chapters) for supposedly committing treason. This is an actual event from Dutch history, although decidedly not a celebrated event. The novel focuses on Cornelius de Witt's godson, Cornelius van Baerle, a tulip grower from Dordrecht. Van Baerle stays out of politics and focuses on creating a black tulip, the person who creates a black tulip will receive a reward of 100,000 florins (the equivalent of over $1 million today). Unfortunately, after his godfather's death van Baerle finds himself caught up in politics, just as he is extremely close to completing his quest of creating the elusive black tulip.

As opposed to some of his more well-known works, The Black Tulip is a relatively short novel by Dumas. Which causes the pace to be a bit higher and the story to be more streamlined, there are no side-plots to distract you from the main storyline. The story does very much focus on the concept of envy, revenge and cowardice and how crazy it can make some people act. That said, with the exception of one, all the characters in the book are either good and honorable or wicked and deceitful. There is very little moral ambiguity in the characters, which makes I think limits the reader's ability to connect with the characters. Overall though I thought it was a pretty entertaining book. If you have read it, what did you think of it?

If you want to read some Dumas, but don't want to commit to one of his longer works right away, I suggest checking this one out. You can find [a copy](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965) of it on [gutenburg.org](https://gutenburg.org).

1.) When Johnnie agrees with Zim that one man is more dangerous than a group (unless the group is coordinated). This is punctuated by Zim winning a 2 on 1 fight. This is also WILDLY outside the realm of reality and literally sounds like a teenage boy's uebermensch like idea of how humans actually fight. I can't seem to explain this away with it just being a statement of the characters' views, because as professional soldiers, they would understand how ridiculous such a statement is.

2.) When Hendricks rightly points out to Zim that crawling in the grass and throwing knives while your enemy has a massive technological advantage is stupid, and Heinlein basically has Zim dodge the question and start talking about the purpose of war. Coupled with the fact that Zim says that there are no dangerous weapons, only dangerous men. Hendricks refutes this by saying a professor with a button could do more damage than the best commando with a knife, and he is obviously correct.

So how did you all take this? Did Heinlein just write his character's poorly (in that no serious combatant would ever hold these idea), or did Heinlein genuinely not understand even the most basic ideas about combat?

This makes me wonder if there is a 'mythotherapeutical' lens to look at these characters and the plot through that would make the story arcs and the dialogue seem more purposeful and less absurd. For example, is Joe's hyper-rationality attributable to some broader myth? Is the Doctor meant to emblemize something greater (like god?).

In a sense, what exactly is Barth ultimately trying to portray in this oeuvre?

Ultimately it was a very interesting and surprising read. Looking for more of his works now.

egpbkn|2019-12-28 10:29:42|'Pay as much as you like' books|"A lot of artists these days, especially musicians and especially in the 'new age' of technology, paypal, etc, will have most of their work online for free. Their songs can be listened to on youtube, soundcloud, and what-have-you. The artist will then post a link to their website with a donation button, or have their album up for 'pay as much as you like'. As a writer myself, I can't help wondering if a system like that would work for books. As a reader/consumer, I love free content, and I'm happy to reimburse authors/artists I like by donating to them, often more than a single book would be worth.

IIRC Andy Weir had something like that going on early on with The Martian (although not 100% sure that was Weir and not another author).

&#x200B;

I might get torn apart for this thread, but I personally think this is a great idea for artists. Certainly, people will 'abuse' this to get free content and never pay a cent, however, in business there's a saying that 80% of your income comes from 20% of your audience/customers. This means that yes, even if hundreds of people 'abuse' the system and never donate a cent, the superfans will more than make up for it.

My own reasoning is this: I like to read a lot and check out book/music/etc, but I won't like all of it. I'll like... maybe 20% of what I read/listen to a lot, but for those 20%, I'm happy to drop a larger portion of my paycheck to collect the albums/books.

&#x200B;

But what does the writing community think? I'm curious if you think this would work for writers, and whether you think it might be a good idea for authors to earn more money without publisher input."|Calathe|False|https://redd.it/egpbkn|16|0.77|0|21|1|books

egmmq5|2019-12-28 05:14:30|A literary mystery|"A few days ago I read the short story ""The Interlopers"" by author H.H. Munro (nom de guerre Saki) and I was quite surprised to find out that I had, in a sort of way, already heard the story before. Indeed, there is one Giovanni Verga, an  Italian author who lived and wrote around the same time as Saki did, and one of the things he produced was a short story whose original title I do not know but that apparently was published in Spanish with the title ""Lobos""-that is, Wolves. I was unable to find the short story in question, but I recalled hearing it in a late night TV show from Argentina called ""Cuentos de terror"" in which author Alberto Laiseca (rest in peace) tells a different horror story every episode... And sure enough, a quick Google search led me to a recording of the episode in question, and after hearing it once more I was convinced. The essence of the story is the same as that from the story of Saki. There are subtle differences: the action takes places in Italy in Verga's story and in Germany in Saki's tale. The rest though, is surprisingly similar; I'll avoid detailing it in case someone has not read the story and wishes to do so.

So, perhaps I've gone a bit too far in calling it a mystery, but what are your opinions? I couldn't find out when Verga's story was published, and thus I cannot know who printed his story first. I also could not find any clue that would indicate that Saki and Verga knew each other or had read each other's work, although of course it is possible they had. Another theory I have is that perhaps the tale itself is some sort of rural or folk tale, and that each author chose to adapt it in their own way, thus the difference in setting between one story and the other; I know of similar cases where this has happened.

As such, documentaries are produced almost always to produce money first and foremost (with a few exceptions like veganism, where producers want to do good by spreading messages).

I also think that documentaries cannot go in depth. They are good for topics where you want just the main points and then go on with your life (like with weight loss, for example).

efusqh|2019-12-26 12:17:34|Japanese Authors that aren't named Haruki Murakami|"Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with Haruki Murakami and his books. I just thought it would be fun to talk about some other Japanese authors that you have enjoyed, as Japan has a pretty large literary history and a fair bit of it gets translated in to English. So I expect that most of the authors that are going to come up, and that I mentioned, are not obscure authors by most measures.

I am nowhere close to well read with regard to Japanese literature, but I always find Japanese books to have a certain strangeness and sometimes a kind of whimsy that appeals to me. That might be in part because Japanese books that contain those aspects are more likely to get translated, but regardless it is a distinct feature of the Japanese literature I've read.

Here are some of my favorite Japanese books that weren't written by Haruki Murakami:

[The Housekeeper and the Professor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3181564-the-housekeeper-and-the-professor) by Yoko Ogawa - A housekeeper is hired to take care of a math professor, whose head-injury causes him to forget what happened after eighty minutes. The housekeeper, her 10-year-old son and the professor slowly form a relationship and learn from each other. I thought it was a wonderful book. I particularly enjoyed how Ogawa built the relationship between the different characters. I also recommend her other book [The Memory Police](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3181564-the-housekeeper-and-the-professor), which was published in English translation earlier this year.

[The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162332.The_Sailor_Who_Fell_from_Grace_with_the_Sea) by Yukio Mishima - 13-year-old Norobu Kuroda is raised by his single mother and hangs out with his gang of friends. One day his mother develops a relationship with Ryuji Tsukazaki, a sailor, and Norobu starts off revering him. That quickly changes and leads to some consequences for Ryuji. I found this to be one of those books that pushes me right to the edge of what I'm willing to read and I can always appreciate that in a book.

[All You Need is Kill](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6255949-all-you-need-is-kill) by Hiroshi Sakurazaka - Earth is invaded by aliens and Keiji Kiriya finds himself with minimal training in a suit of battle armor in the middle of a battlefield, where he promptly dies. Only to wake up the next morning to do it all again. If that premise sounds familiar that is probably because this book was the basis for the Tom Cruise/Emily Blunt movie, Edge of Tomorrow. It was a pretty high paced book and, while the concept might not have been overly original, the author wrote a great story.

eghr4h|2019-12-27 22:11:09|Death and the Dervish by Mesa Selimovic|"This year has seen me revisit several books that were a part of my highschool syllabus, driven either by my fading memory of the work, my wish to revisit it now that I'm almost twice the age I was then or because I never finished it in the first place and I felt it a shame. 

Sadly, [Death and the Dervish](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/358846.Death_and_the_Dervish) falls in the last category - while I haven't been able to remember exactly why I dropped it, I always felt bad for doing it, remembered it fondly and been promising myself for years now that I'd get around to reading it. 

So what's it about? It's the tale of Ahmed Nurrudin, a sheikh of a respected Islamic monastery at the edge of town who has a rough awakening to the world when his brother gets taken prisoner by the town's totalitarian Ottoman regime. Having the form of memoir, the story unfolds through Ahmed and his rich mental and spiritual life. At moments Kafkaesque in its absurd and futility and at others so Hamsun-like in its streams of consciousness/internalized monologues full of selfdoubt, religious fervor and moral superiority, the tale is narrated beautifully and lyrically and ends up capturing the soul of Bosnia and most of the Balkans with it. It's a tale of love and fear and hatred, a tale of oppression and freedom and corruption, a tale of life and of death...

egeo3c|2019-12-27 18:19:01|Where to borrow ebooks?|"Hi bookers,

This morning I realised that buying ebooks doesn't really make sense. Don't get me wrong, of course supporting/paying authors for their work is fundamental for them to keep on working, but buying an ebook is simply not the same of buying a paper one. 

It is easy to get attached to a paper book - maybe it was a present from your mother or you had bought it during a special trip or you perfectly remember how and when you spilled some drop of coffee over it, but this is all lost with ebooks, and the money spent there doesn't spark any feeling (for me at least).

I therefore thought that it would be just great to find an online library from which to borrow ebooks, even at a monthly cost. Something like the kindle unlimited, but with \_\_all\_\_ books, not only those from largely unknown writers, minor publishers or times before the creation of the copyright.

Do you know if there's anything alike on the web?

But they bother me. They seem obnoxious to me, really, especially if it looks like some amalgamation of stock images, like the cliche bloody knife, or red feminine lips. I semi-recently bought and read *The Road* and I absolutely adore the cover, because it’s completely black except for the lettering, and fits its feel very well. My copy of *The Lord of the Rings* fits this style some as well, with a cover with the title, the One Ring’s inscription around a golden circle, and a white eye in the middle. The rest of the cover is plain red. It doesn’t show much but it means much, and for me that delivers a good first impression and brings meaning to simplicity.

I first discovered the first title through the manga adaptation of it and purchased the second volume as it's a quite rare series nowadays. Being  bummed about the fact that there was no way I'd find the other two volumes, I looked it up and found the original novel and bought it. I got it like two years ago and quickly began reading it, but the problem is that I haven't finished it yet and there aren't that many pages left for me to be done with it. The thing is, I really enjoyed what I read and find myself thinking about it a lot, but (idk if it's because of the translation I got) there were times I needed to put it down as it felt like it was really personal and it wasn't my place to read it. I really like the way it's written tho. 

The later title is one I got fairly recently and also picked up very fast. The same thing happened. I want to finish it and it's one that I am enjoying but due to being busy, I ended up putting it down and never picking it up again. It's a weird one and the way this certain character creeps me out, makes me want to continue and see how it all unfolds but at the same time it doesn't as the character makes me uncomfortable.

With all of this being said, I wanted to know if anyone has read any of these two and how do you feel about them!"|bluesyroads|False|https://redd.it/egild4|3|0.71|0|4|1|books

&#x200B;

The first of the book was really captivating, it gave me a new perspective on slavery and the lives of slaves as well as whites role in a slave state. I read 12 Years A Slave earlier this year and Coates really helped me better grasp a slaves own role in slavery, if that makes sense? And how slaves in one state are deterred from escape by knowing they can't be sent to to the deep south. I think as a non-fiction historical writer Coates is really unbeatable. 

The rest of the book really fell flat, especially once Hi got to Philadelphia. His role turned from protagonist to...I don't even know. I feel like he didn't actually do anything. I almost laughed at the end of the book when Hi was told he didn't end up having an impact on the Underground's operations and wasn't as useful as they thought he would be. He never got the opportunity to do anything. All we ever heard was what Hi was told other people were doing. He did go on one rescue with Moses but even that was uneventful. I was bored out of my mind for the second half of this book. Hi's power didn't really even come into play that much after he escaped from, and returned to, Virginia.

I thought about starting this discussion since I couldn't actually get into this genre (guilty of not trying enough, stopping after some Lovecraft), but in a way, I'm convinced it has quite a lot to offer.

So, readers who are big fans of fantasy literature: why do you like it? Please note that I am *not* saying something such as ""how can you like such books"" or starting rants, superiority of one genre over another etc. I'm just curious what do you feel they are offering you?

Regarding fantasy, I can think of two possible answers:
- they highlight human traits by attaching them to mostly non-human creatures. This way, the features are distilled and one focuses not on the ""human"" aspect of it, but on the feature itself (such as kindness, guilt, revenge, lore etc.);
- they are fairy tales for grown ups and since we've all been mesmerized by fairy tales when we were children, it's purely a delight to keep reading more of the same when we are adults.

eg564s|2019-12-27 02:47:05|As the decade closes out, what are your views, opinions (regardless of how popular/unpopular they are) do you have about the book community, writing trends, books that have come out, and general publishing trends, over the past ten-years?|"Another decade is coming to a close. In times like this, we reflect on the last ten-years in our lives and the world around us. Since this is a Books forum, we will discuss books. I want to see what opinions – regardless if they are popular – you hold to books during the past ten-years. Whether that’s about the trends in your current genres, writing styles, the pop-culture of literature as the decade winds up.

I mainly read History books with a focus in World War 2. Most of the books I read were written decades ago. But some of the ones I read the past ten-years give more of a global focus, as well as spending time talking about the impact of the war in the years that followed.

My fiction trends are science fiction and YA. 

I feel that without a doubt the most impactful books of the past ten-years, books that impacted the culture around us and the book sphere, is the Hunger Games trilogy. The last book was published in 2010, so this placing in this post counts. 

The Young-Adult book market was flushed with dystopian stories that were resurging because of the popularity of that book series. Even if the stories were not dystopian, pop-culture, and social realism became more common in the past several years after wide success of the Games which focused on exploiting America’s obsession with the celebrity. I think as the world gets worse around us because of political unrest or climate change, many of these stories will become more popular again and get film adaptations, giving the stories new life.

With the new Hunger Games book coming out in a few months, I am curious to see the impact it will have on the book community.

I often get absorbed with what the characters are doing, so I'll imagine the feeling of taking shoes off at the door, the issue with this is that I can never complete the action. The shoe is stuck to my foot, I cant get it off, or the clothes are stuck on my body, it usually pertains to things being stuck on me and I cant get it off no matter how hard I try to imagine taking it off, its just *stuck*. So, I'll take a breath and try to collect myself, but once I start reading again I get back into that mindset and into those thoughts. Its very hard to stop obsessing over it. I try to wiggle my feet or move my hands to remind myself I'm here and not in my head. This is incredibly disruptive when I'm reading. This is the only symptom of OCD I have, and its only when I'm reading, I haven't been diagnosed, but it is a symptom. Do any of you experience this while reading? Is there anything I can do to get out of it/prevent it?

edit: holy fuck I cant believe how many spelling errors I made

Another edit: so, i have solved my problem in an extremely odd way, but it works so well that I am elated. This has been such an issue for me, picturing things in my head, that I’m just glad I can end these thoughts. If I feel a piece of clothing stuck on my hand, I just imagine it being *absorbed* into my body and poof!

eg0bvy|2019-12-26 20:15:31|Need clarification about a paragraph in Man's Searching for Meaning|"**I understand this is a long post but I'm just trying to make sense of the book thus far... perhaps to clarify if I'm on the right track and possibly, start a discussion.**

*""The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of a trick learning while mastering the art of living. Yet it is possible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp, although suffering is omnipresent. To draw an analogy: a man's suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the ""size"" of human suffering is absolutely relative"".*

I'm new to the whole reading game. I started this book last night and I'm about a 100 pages in. I just want start a discussion going (hopefully, I won't read any spoilers). I also want to clarify my understanding thus far *(the paragraph mentioned above is where I stopped reading and started making this post*).

Dr. Frankl is describing the day to day life of the concentration camps, leaving out the specific horrific details of it. The reason he doesn't speak so much about the horrific details is because of the second phase - *getting used to the concentration camp and complete emotional detachment*. He focuses more on the other experiences - singing italian songs, making jokes, interacting with their wives (regardless of whether they are alive or not) and mentions the scutwork they do -shoveling and picking the ground but BRIEFLY. I guess he is trying to show the point of view of the prisoners and how the point of view evolved over time.

That's what I understood so far. I'm not sure if I'm on the right track.

Now, coming to the excerpt from the book above: What does he mean by that paragraph? Does he mean that regardless of the etiology of the suffering, we don't feel the relativity of it? It consumes us as a whole? So we can't compare our suffering to the suffering of others? So far the narrative tells me that we can get used to any sort of suffering. After a certain point (after we reach second phase), we would live normally regardless of the external conditions?"|EnzoRacing|False|https://redd.it/eg0bvy|13|0.9|0|11|1|books

I went into it without really knowing anything about her, other than the fact that she dies. As I approached the end, I was half-expecting her to reveal suspicions of some person who may have potentially rat them out, as foreshadowing is common in any work of fiction. But this wasn't fiction (and I read fiction almost exclusively). Yet my mind had trouble making that distinction, and so I'm still waiting for something that can resemble a traditional conclusion, but instead I'm met with an abrupt end. 

It was just another entry like any other. There was no foreshadowing of anything because she didn't know what was going to happen next. She never knew that would be her last entry. And to make it all the more tragic, everything was looking up for them. The U.S. and Britain were making strong headway against the Germans. She was even hopeful for being able to return to school in the fall. They just needed to have had held out a little longer and everything would have worked out for them. 

It's just horrible to get to know someone so intimately, just to have them die senselessly. She had so many aspirations, of being a writer and a journalist. She loved history and spent many of her days just educating herself. She was a kind and loving person, and someone who could recognize their own faults. And despite her circumstances, she was always so incredibly optimistic. Something I never would have anticipated. 

All I can think about is how she didn't deserve to die. And to think her story was only one of many makes it all the more difficult to fathom.

What I love so much about science fiction short stories is that every story you start out not knowing where or when it will play, or even what the laws of physics in that particular universe will be. Exhalation is a prime example of that, with many different settings and stories, but religion and science remain key tropes, just like in his earlier works.

The only drawback is that the longest story (""The Lifecycle of Software Objects"") feels rather lazily written - it takes up a good portion of the overall book, yet is easily the weakest story in it. It feels more like a half-finished abandoned novella than a proper short story."|sc2summerloud|False|https://redd.it/cpge3j|189|0.93|0|35|1|books
