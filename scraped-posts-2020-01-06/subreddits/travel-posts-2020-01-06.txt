In this series of weekly threads we want to focus on regions that have a lot to offer to travellers: the towns, nature, and other interesting places whether they are lesser or more known. If more known provide more in depth suggestions like tours, things to do, places to eat, your personal trip review, etc. 

Please contribute all and any questions / thoughts / suggestions / ideas / stories / highlights about this travel destination, whether it be places you want to see or experiences you have had.

I lost my debit card yesterday while traveling. I still have a credit card and a backup savings card I can use to pull out cash in the meantime, but I’m currently left without a backup. Where can I have a debit card mailed when I’m traveling overseas for a long period of time?

I thought of contacting a hostel/hotel I’ll be visiting and have it mailed there, but that seems quite risky. Any ideas?

I won’t be going home for another 2 months so another backup is ideal. I’m in Thailand for the next month if that matters.

Myself and a friend (37 M) are thinking of checking out Oktoberfest, but would like to make a longer trip out of it,

He wants to see Berlin for sure, so I’m thinking we could fly in to Berlin and make our way South to the festival in Munich over the span of a week or so.

We’re interested in the historical sights and checking out the food and drink. Definitely any awesome scenery if there’s some on the way.

Any ideas on what we could check out or do on the way south to Munich?

el05dz|2020-01-06 20:54:22|Balkan trip|"Hello folks!  


I am looking for recommendations about the Balkans.   
More specifically, I am quite flexible on how long the trip should be (anywhere between 1 and 3 months is fine), but it would have to start at the end of May.  
As the Adriatic coast can be busy during summer, I thought it would make sense to start the trip with Croatia.  
I can fly to Zagreb, Rijeka or Zadar.  
Zadar would have my preference as I would go instead to Zagreb and Rijeka later, in July.

About me :   
I will be 35 by then, and I will likely be travelling by myself, which I am used to.  
I would stay in hostels, but I am fine with overnights buses or airbnb.   
I don't like super touristy places - so I intend to go to Dubrovnik for example, but won't stay there very long.  
I have several trip ideas, depending on the time I want to spend around the Balkans.  
Note I have not checked yet if there is public transportation between the different places.

Short trip :  
Zadar > Plitvice Lakes > Split > Mostar > Dubrovnik > Kotor > Budva > Belgrade (day trip to Nis likely) > Novi Sad > Vukovar/Osijek > Zagreb > Rijeka > Ljubljana > (Graz to fly back, or skip Ljubljana and fly back from Rijeka).

&#x200B;

Mid-length :  
Zadar > Plitvice Lakes > Split > Mostar > Dubrovnik > Kotor > Budva > Shkoder > Tirana > Ohrid > Skopje > Nis > Belgrade > Novi Sad > Vukovar/Osijek > Zagreb > Rijeka > Ljubljana > (Graz to fly back, or skip Ljubljana and fly back from Rijeka).  
If the above is too long for one month, I could do this instead :   


Longest trip  
Zadar > Plitvice Lakes > Split > Mostar > Dubrovnik > Kotor > Budva > Shkoder > Tirana > Ohrid > Skopje > Sofia > Plovdiv >  Kazanluk > Varna > Bucharest > Brasov > Bucharest > Belgrade (likely would have to fly) > Nis > Novi Sad >  Osijek > Zagreb > Rijeka > Ljubljana > (Graz to fly back, or skip Ljubljana and fly back from Rijeka).  
Basically the same idea as the shorter one, but with a longer loop.

I am only listing cities, but also would like to explore the country side a bit, take day trips and see the brutalist monuments where I can.

&#x200B;

Basically, I am looking for some guidance as to whether these trips are doable within the timeframe, and if there are places I should skip or spend less time in as others.

I'm thinking of visiting South Korea and one or two of the following (Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taipei, Beijing) this year. My options are to go either in mid-March to mid-April or mid-September to mid-October.

One of the concerns I have is that March is known to have pretty bad air pollution levels in Korea (I'm guessing Shanghai and Beijing would be similar if not worse) and early Fall is part of typhoon season across East Asia.

I consider myself to be a healthy young adult but which one of these two seasons would affect general sightseeing and touristy activities more? Is either one of them a better time to go for other reasons?

Day 2: Valencia

My fiance and I will be getting married next October and we are trying to decide on where to go for our honeymoon. We really want somewhere to just relax by a pool, do a few scenic hikes, and eat some tasty food. We recently spent eight very busy days in New York City and we don't want to do something that hectic again for our honeymoon. 

We also have a few other desires out of it:

* We live in a dry climate (Boise) and would prefer less humidity. Hawaii is about the worst we can take because the ocean wind tends to make it a bit more pleasant.
* Fewer sites to see. The more stuff there is to do, the more inclined we are to see and do everything. We just want to relax on this trip because we just planned a big wedding and my fiance will be graduating from law school next year. 
* Less than $4000 preferably. Only one of us is currently making an income and we would like to save some money. We can be persuaded to spend more but it would have to be pretty amazing. 
* Cruises are not an option. They tend to be overcrowded and you don't usually get enough time in each port. 
* Outside of the contiguous United States

So far we've come up with either Maui or Banff. We've been to Kauai before and loved it but and we would like to go to a different island if we end up going back. Banff because we love the mountains and hiking and the views would be next level.

An example trip I enjoyed during winter of 2018:  Palms place hotel in Vegas.  Soaking tub next to floor to ceiling windows with a mountain view.  Hot air balloons floating above mountains were fun to watch from the tub!  Drove rental car to an easy hike on one of the mountains I saw from my hotel room.  Took advantage of some of the nicer restaurants, like Bouchon at the Vetetian.  Hotel room had a full kitchen I used for making snacks / drinks. Kitchen was a bit dirty, but it wasn't a big deal to make it more sanitary.  I feel I got lucky, going at a time of the year that Vegas had the least crowds, as I just wanted to relax.  Had there been a big convention going on, I might have had a very different experience. Overall, for a last minute escape from a winter cold snap, this was an amazing value.  

For this winter vacation: I’d like accommodation with either a big bathtub, a small private indoor plunge pool or just an indoor pool for all guests. Some destinations might be warm enough for outdoor pools, but ideally I’d like to not be dependent on the weather for that unless very certain.  Some type of easy local hiking area would be ideal also.  Definitely want at least a few nice restaurants near to accommodation.  Key West Florida and Palms Springs California are places I’m interested in.  But I’m just as open to Texas, New Mexico, Mexico, Costa Rica, Bahamas etc.

I live in Estonia. My wife is from Russia, and she got Estonian multi-entry Schengen visa (C-visa) from 25.08.19 to 25.08.20. She visited me in Estonia in the period of 32 days: from 26.08.19 to 26.09.19. Then she returned to Russia.

Now, today (06.01.2020) she comes to Estonia again. More than 90 days have passed since she left Schengen zone, so she must be able to stay in Estonia for 90 days, right? Like, until the beginning of April. I think I understand current system well enough, and even all calculators available online tell so, too. (EDIT: including calculator recommended by bot here)

But the customs officer on Estonian side explicitly told her that she has only 58 days left, because ""the second 180-period has not started yet"". He definitely did mean that she'll have to leave Estonia in 58 days.

Can somebody guess what could that be? I would guess it was some mistake on the side of tired, sleepy officer at the midst of the night. But he told that, while reading something from his monitor, so he didn't calculate this on the spot - it seems to be some info from their system.

The kicker is that the flights leave late enough in the day that they won’t require vacation from my girlfriend or myself - so they are no- brainer easy getaways. They both amount to about 2.5 full days. 

Looking for suggestions on how to use the time. Not interested in spending any time in Vegas, but rather just using it as a cheap hub to access the American Southwest. Our goal is to spend as much of the 2.5 days hiking and/or rock climbing or some other outdoor activity.

So far, for the first long weekend (Easter) is tentatively planned as Red Rock Canyon for rock climbing day 1, driving to Pahrump to spend the night, and then spending all day in Death Valley national park. Then either staying the night again in Pahrump, or potentially driving back to Vegas and hitting valley of fire before our late-afternoon flight the next day.

The idea for weekend two is a little less fleshed out and so far includes either Zion (it would be our third time there) or Joshua Tree in some capacity depending on the weather. 

On to my question... any other suggestions of outdoor stuff we could get to in either of those weekends? We are totally fine with driving reasonably long distances (I’ve already considered heading to Yosemite one weekend - and not ruling it out so consider that the limit).

ekjt4j|2020-01-05 22:08:04|TSA locks keep breaking/disappearing...|"Warning in advance that this is a hybrid “seeking recommendation”/rant post.

I’m organizing my expenses from 2019 for tax day and found that I spent like $120 last year on TSA approved travel locks.

For context, I travel with two hard tool boxes loaded just under 50lbs with one lock each and a pelican hard case that usually winds up gate checked with two locks.

A few of them just randomly disappeared from my luggage, but the majority were thrown in my box/case busted (regularly locks are just thrown in the box not busted, just never re-attached...) I averaged one lock down per every other trip and had two trips where all four were either missing or broken.

I’m not sure if the TSA peeps are just busting them out of laziness or if they’re getting damaged some other way (I’m sure it’s a combo of both), but either way I’m looking for some decent locks that will either be hard enough to break that TSA is incentivized to unlock them instead or sturdy enough that the baggage pushers don’t destroy them.

I’ve tried a bunch of brands—Cheapos from Amazon, Masterlock, Swissgear, REI ones that I think were Eagle Creek, and it just doesn’t seem to make a difference.

The stuff in the boxes is pretty spendy and I have a stipend for stuff like this, so I’d be willing to pay up to $50 a lock if I knew they weren’t going to break. It’s just getting so annoying buying locks on every other trip.

I should note I don’t expect the locks to provide a ton of security; they’re there mainly as extra measure to keep the boxes closed when a latch unclasps or to prevent opportunist grabs. They’ve saved my Pelican from opening twice when the latches somehow magically unlatched themselves.

No food allergies in the family.  We do eat meat but most of us don't like seafood.  We have done (and enjoyed) on other vacations anything outdoors, touring museums, sight seeing, etc.  We prefer to do things we can't do at home.  We do like going to the beach or things with water.  

I am looking for some ideas of good cities and places in the area.  We don't have specifics of what cities- just that we visit or drive through the 4 states."|makella0209|False|https://redd.it/ekjp45|2|0.75|0|12|1|travel

I reserved a room in the new Amsterdam hostle type accomodation called BUNK.

I used the site hotelspecials.nl
They offered a pod for 2 for 49,22 €/night without cancellation and the same room for 82,30 €/night with free cancellation. Here's the screenshot: imgur.com/a/GYOh9x5

I specifically contacted them regarding the price, and they confirmed the price via email. I then went on to reserve the cheaper option, but didn't recieve any confirmation email from them. I checked again the next day, still nothing, and as I went to the site I saw they doubled the price of the pod.

I contacted them and they are trying to get out of the deal saying they didn't get my reservation and that they're unable to change the price. Mind you this happend on the 2nd of January during night time! There were less than 12 hours between my reservation and the time I saw they upped the price.

Me and a couple of friends will be traveling to South Korea for 2 weeks, 23rd April - 7th May.

We're lovers of nature and culture, with a strong attraction to food and drink. Open to new ideas and out of the ordinary experiences.

Now, we are used to 'blitzkrieg' style vacations with meticulous planning. I know some of you would be against this, but it has worked out really well for us in the past. With our jobs having very limited paid leave we have to make use of the time we got.

This is the itinerary thus far:

* Day 1: Heathrow to Seoul
* Day 2: Seoul
* Day 3: Seoul
* Day 4: Chuncheon
* Day 5: Sokcho (with plans of going to the national park)
* Day 6: Gangneung
* Day 7: Ulleungdo (will have backup plan should the ferries not be operating)
* Day 8: Ulleungdo
* Day 9: Gyeongju
* Day 10: Busan
* Day 11: Jeju
* Day 12: Jeju
* Day 13: Seoul
* Day 14: Seoul to Heathrow

Please let me know if this seems like a bit too much. Like I said we are used to a fast pace, but I must admit this could be pushing it, not sure.

Also, would you guys recommend car hire or public transport for getting around? I understand that once within the city public transport would be best, but what about the parts in between?

I think in regards to Ulleungdo advice I'll make another post, though if you want to share any would be much appreciated.

Last Christmas,my family and I went to Taiwan. The street we stayed at was noisy and dirty, but all in all pretty okay. That is until we learned that there were prostitutes in the area.

We already paid for the BnB so there was no turning back, they didn't bother us thankfully but there was karaoke night every now and then because we were staying on top of a restaurant.

So while it was a fun trip, it wasn't exactly safe for kids and I'm pretty sure we were at the Red Light District. And just an FYI, I don't know the name of the street we were staying at.

So this year's Christmas, we're planning on going to Vietnam and, according to my sisters, we'll stay at either Ho Chi Minh or Hanoi so I was wondering if any of you guys know of some safe streets, districts, etc. to stay at.

Maybe its because I’m traveling alone? I don’t know, I just find it boring by myself and exhausting. I hate that travel has such an environment footprint, and I feel guilty and hypocritical. I’m an 18 year old girl and because I’m alone I’m too scared to go out when it’s dark, and it already gets dark at like 16:00 in Europe here, so then the rest of the time I’m stuck in the hostel doing nothing. I know hostels are great places to meet people etc but honestly? I can not be bothered. It takes so much energy to meet to people, I find it tiring enough talking to people that I already know.

Another source stated that Australian passport holders also need to show:

* Proof on your purpose of travel
* Evidence of necessary financial means
* Other documents required specifically by each country to be visited

I am the type of person that overpacks and likes to buy stuff when traveling so I am used to carrying a big suitcase. For this trip, I decided I want to travel with a backpack and pack as little as I can. As a test, I took my Osprey Ozone 46 backpack for 5 day trip by packing 2 days of clothing. I still had hard time on the way back. 
Below are my options and my concerns for each. I've seen a lot of reviews for the classic Fairview but not much on Fairview Trek. If anyone could give me insight it would be great. 
1. Osprey Fairview Trek 50
I really like the front loading design and how it comes with it's own cover, but 50L seems not much bigger than my Ozone 46. 
2. Fairview Trek 70
The capacity should be more than enough but I am short(4'11/149cm) and I'm afraid this backpack is too big for my height. 
3. Fairview 70
Great reviews but I'm not sure if I like the design of the big bag+day bag attached and it doesn't come with a cover. 

After researching, I am leaning more towards the Fairview Trek 50 and carrying my North Face Borealis(28L) or Kanken laptop (18L) as a carry-on/day bag. How much of a difference is Fairview Trek 50 compared to the Ozone 46 that I already have?

I have many questions/ am of need of advice about certain topics. After looking online for many of these answers I have decided to come here for some potential help.  No one in my family has traveled much and I don't really have anyone to ask. I land in Spain(Madrid), and I am going to be staying in Barcelona, Paris, London, Amsterdam, and leaving in Berlin. I cannot describe my excitement, but I am trying to make it as seamless as possible. 

**General Questions**

**Phone**:  I have seen multiple ways of traveling while accounting for cellular data: SIM cards or portable wifi devices, but I am going to be in a different country every 4 days. From what I understand since I am moving that much, that quickly it makes those options less viable. **Verizon offers a $130 month long plan for multiple countries (covers all my destinations) up to 2gb of data, with calling and texting. Is there a better alternative?** 

**Traveling Insurance?**: **Basically, is this required?** I was going to travel without insurance but I was just told that countries require you to have it to enter that country. Is this true? 

**Euros/Pounds/Payment**: So this is an interesting dilemma, I do not want to travel with a lot of cash obviously but I do not want to pay the fee's that come with a debit card. My strategy around this was something along these lines: to start a credit card that would be on an international plan and thus get around the fees/ not carry cash. The problem here is that after this trip I do not plan on traveling outside the country for a very long time most likely (I am a poor college student starting grad school in 5 months). **Is there a better solution to this? Am I missing something?**

 **Traveling within Europe**: So I bought an EU Rail Pass that I can use within Europe. My only question is this: **When looking at certain trains, for example from Barcelona to Paris, it has 3 connecting train rides. My Pass has a train limit that I can use, will this trip count as 1 from Barcelona to Paris or 3 trips since I am going on that many connecting trains?**

**Hostel Lockers** I am staying at hostels throughout my travels, I have my padlock and am ready to go. **Is it common/possible to use the lockers past check out?** 

I would greatly appreciate any help with these questions, thank you very much!"|supbro21|False|https://redd.it/ekbc87|0|0.5|0|16|1|travel
ekb10t|2020-01-05 09:45:45|Invited to Vietnamese New Year dinner; What can I bring?|"I'm an American staying at an airbnb in Hanoi for a while, and the host family just invited me to their family New Years dinner on Jan 24th; they haven't been around until now so I haven't gotten to know them (though I may a bit in the coming weeks), so I'm not really sure the size of this thing, who will be there, what they're like, etc.

Online I've seen sort of basic suggestions like gift boxes with cookies/fruit/whatever; feels a little generic to me, but I'm also not sure what else might be appropriate (or inappropriate, god forbid). Sadly I probably won't be able to find a favorite bottle of alcohol or unique gift from the states or anything like that either, though I may try looking.

Any tips for a foreigner walking into this situation? I'm open to anything, and am happy to spend money.

Also, should I have red envelopes of cash ready for any kids? If so, how much?

My wardrobe also isn't amazing; I have a nice sweater I can wear, but only black jeans (in good shape) and scuffed doc martens; will that be a problem?

Thanks in advance! If there's a better place to ask, I'd love to know that too."|jackphelps|False|https://redd.it/ekb10t|0|0.5|0|9|1|travel
ek7ghi|2020-01-05 03:38:26|Advice and ideas for a trip to northern Poland (Gdańsk area)?|"Hello, I am an American trying to create an outline for a trip to northern Poland for myself, my parents, and my sister. My grandmother is from Pomerania, but she is German and lived there when it was part of Germany. She is terminally ill, and when we were visiting her in the hospital she recommended that we visit “that place they call Poland” (her words, not mine) and see the Teutonic architecture and such, especially the Malbork castle. My mom and I thought about it, and now we’re thinking that a family vacation to northern Poland would be an interesting heritage trip of sorts. I’m trying to figure out a basic outline for what this trip might entail, to help push it from pipe dream to reality. I have a few questions and I’m wondering if anyone familiar with Poland can help me out. 

1. I was looking at lodging options in Gdánsk, specifically on Airbnb. I was surprised to find many nice, centrally-located, highly-rated apartments that could accommodate the four of us for only USD $30-40 per night. This seems a little bit suspiciously low to me. Are there certain districts or neighborhoods in Gdánsk that we should avoid for safety reasons, or is this normal for lodging costs in Poland?

2. How much Polish is necessary to know when traveling in northern Poland? We speak English and German fluently, but my knowledge of the Polish language is limited to random little phrases you pick up from living in Chicago.

3. My sister is very skeptical of this travel idea. She has been to Germany and loved it, but she has no interest in visiting Poland for some reason. I’m trying to think of ways to sweeten the deal for her - maybe we could go to the beach? Anyone know of some good, tourist-friendly beaches along the coast of the Baltic Sea in Poland?

4. Aside from Malbork Castle and going to the beach, what are some cool things to do in or near Gdańsk? We are a fairly active family and enjoy walking around, enjoying nature, swimming, etc. I enjoy shopping, though I can’t speak for the rest of the family about that. We’re up for pretty much anything, except bars/nightlife. 

Thanks so much in advance for any recommendations and help!"|kabea26|False|https://redd.it/ek7ghi|3|0.81|0|6|1|travel

Going on a family trip with parents and I (Early 50's and 23) and we want to visit Switzerland. I was wondering how long ideally would be good to stay for. I was thinking one day per city (Geneva, Lucerne, Bern, Zurich). Coming to Europe for 9 days and thinking 5-6 in Switzerland and 3 in Turkey. Also I have a ton of hotel points I wanted to cash in on but it seemed like Zurich is the only place where I could get a free stay for 3 in one room without any crazy excess surcharges since in Lucerne it costs 300-600+ CHF per stay with 3 people. 

&#x200B;

Essentially, Questions:

&#x200B;

1) How long is ideal to stay in Switzerland to visit Alps and countryside and whatever else is best to see? Is 5 too many? Normally my motto is 3-4 in each city is plentiful. 

2) Is it feasible to stay in Zurich and commute out each day to the countrysides or would it be best just to bite the bullet and pay for hotel stays instead of using points?"|Cancel-IT|False|https://redd.it/ek9iz2|0|0.5|0|8|1|travel

My wife and I are friends with another couple and thought about travelling to Italy in February, specifically Venezia and Rome. We live in Denmark and will bring a child each, aged 2 and 7. What I want help with is finding cheap but non-garbage hotels. It seems very expensive when I search on [hotels.com](https://hotels.com). We just need to sleep at the hotel and see things during the day.

Our brainstorm plan is to fly from Hamburg in Germany to Venezia. Stay in Venezia for 2 nights and move on to Rome for 2-3 nights. I don't know if I should give any other information, but the travel has to be within February 8th - 15th. We found some plane tickets that seem OK in price. Just the hotels we are worried about. It's off-season, so I personally expect it to be a bit cheaper than summer for instance. I don't want to go the ""We'll see when we get there"" path, because it might become too expensive.

I hope someone can help us out. Of course, if there's more I should inform about, please do tell. Thank you."|KemalKinali|False|https://redd.it/ekbqc4|0|0.17|0|11|1|travel

Traveling will be two mid-30s adults, a nearly 3 year old, and possibly our mid-20s nanny. Son is a good traveler, adaptable, has traveled internationally with us before, and eats everything. (All that to say that I don’t think we’re insane for doing this vacation now. He’ll also have plenty of future opportunities to go abroad later when he’ll remember it.)

I’m thinking about flying into Barcelona (Boston to Lisbon to Barcelona on TAP looks like the best option currently) and then flying out of Bilbao. Thinking we’ll pretty equally divide our time between Barcelona, Madrid, and San Sebastián. Thinking of a train from Barcelona to Madrid (son loves trains so this will be a highlight) and possibly renting a car to drive from Madrid to San Sebastián.  Think we may try to do a day trip to Toledo from Madrid, hit Monserrat from Barcelona, and otherwise just do slow-paced exploring in each location. 

Any thoughts on whether we’re on the right track with this itinerary?  Should we cut San Sebastián for Granada or Seville?  Or should we think about staying over in Lisbon on one end and cutting a city in Spain?

Two specific questions:  (1) What are opinions on TAP?  (2) Our son will love tapas (loves olives, cheeses, cured meats), but I’m a little concerned about how to actually bring him along to experience having tapas. If we stick to larger spots, is there generally seating?

However, the security lines were long and they (airport security) were not letting people who had short layovers skip to the top of the line, making her miss the 11am flight to the US. 

The airline (Lufthansa/United) are blaming it on her, since ""her first flight got in at 9am and she had plenty of time to make her connection"".

I've altered it a bit for other reasons -- changed some things, moved some things around, largely to be in New York by a certain date, which is where I'll be stopping instead of going home right away. We're also ending in Paris so we could fly direct from Paris to NY without a big layover, which many of the flights out of Zurich had, and because my Dad and I would like to do a couple things we didn't get to do on our last trip there. 

Questions: 

1) Am I spending too much time in Berner Oberland? It looks beautiful and I'd like to have time to do everything there that's worth doing, but was wondering still if I need that much time. (People have told me to skip Lucerne and that it's overrated, but I would still like to see it. It looks really beautiful to me.) 

2) Is Appenzell worth it? It seems a bit out of the way. Maybe too much a pain to get to for the 1/2 day we're spending there. The main attraction for me when planning was the Bergastthaus restaurant on the mountainside.

3) Any other recommendations?

Day 0: Arrive in Zurich late evening.

ek0936|2020-01-04 18:22:59|What are some of your favourite underrated, or just less known cities across North/Central America?|"Funnily enough as a kid in school I learned that North America only consists of 3 countries, Canada, US and Mexico but I don't think that's what other people were taught and I think the correct, and hopefully most popular definition of North America would be Canada down to Panana and the Caribbean.

So what are your favourite lesser known cities in North America? Personally I haven't traveled much at all here but I live in New Brunswick, Canada.

**Saint John's, Newfoundland** Though I haven't been, I've heard good things because of it's bar scene and colourful houses in the downtown area.

**Gros Mourne National Park** in the west of the province is also somewhere I've been wanting to visit and I've heard it's a beautiful area to go hiking in.

**Lunenburg, Nova Scotia** is supposed to be really cute town to own in a cottage along the coast and go fishing, colourful houses and just a relaxing environment from what I've heard. Haven't actually been but I just checked and it's only a 3.5 hour drive away so maybe in the summer I'll check it out.

**Quebec City** Probably already quite popular for international tourists but I felt like mentioning it anyways. It's probably the most historic city in Canada with it's citadel, fairmont hotel, museums about french lifestyle, cathedral/basilica and just a lot of old buildings that you don't see in most Canadian cities these days.

**Victoria, British Columbia** Another city that is definitely popular among Canadians and probably some Americans who live in the PNW of the US I don't know how popular it is among international visitors. Hatley castle, cathedral, beautiful gardens nearby, coastal city a nice China town, Legislative Assembly (nice building to see in every provinces capital imo). I'm actually really excited to visit Victoria and Vancouver island in general on my road trip.

Those are my recommendations for Canada, feel free to share your recommendations for anywhere in North America :). Also this is just a repost from

To be frank, I want to make sure I didn't do anything bad here. I think I am just way overthinking. 

I booked a basic economy ticket from United back in November. These are non changeable or refundable after 24 hours. Just yesterday, my boss told me I had to be there for a meeting the day I was supposed to leave and the day I was supposed to travel back. 

I thought I was SOL, so I called and got the whole spiel about how I can't do much. I was able to get them to change my flight, and refund my old one. The new flight was $70 more. Whatever, I'll get refunded the old one and use this new one. 

I realized today I couldn't go at all anymore. Something came up, and I could not take the new flight I just paid for (family emergency). I thought I was royally screwed again, so I called to see if there was anything I could do. Since this new ticket was in the 24 hour window, I got a full refund.

ejy8wb|2020-01-04 15:54:34|Advice dealing with a car rental agency who mandated insurance that was not in original reservation|"Hello!

My wife  and I recently traveled on our honeymoon to Costa Rica    For that trip, we booked a car rental through Avis, who I’ve booked with many times before (domestic and international).   On My reservation, I declined all insurance and additional items(child seat, gps) etc due to the fact my chase Safire reserve card can cover the insurance.   Upon arrival to the Avis in CR, the employees showed me this sign that basic insurance was mandatory and they wouldn’t rent to me without accepting jt.  I went back through my reservation where I clearly declined all insurance but that was irrelevant in a country outside the USA.    My estimated cost including fees was $438 USD.  Upon arrival with this new mandated insurance and additional taxes was $833.  They showed me this hidden paragraph way deep in the T&C showing how it was legal.   

I signed to avoid any first travel issues on our honeymoon.   

After we returned home I saw the charge post for $833.  So I called Avis to dispute the fact that my reservation said I declined the insurance but the rental shop said other wise.   My first experience with a customer service rep was completely unprofessional to where he contracticted himself and told me to “cut my losses”.  Specifically, I had him look up the policy for the Costa Rica branch and he told me his system said insurance was optional and “I signed” so cut my losses.  I showed him what the Avis in Costa Rica showed me in the T&C (If LDW/PDW is declined, then Additional Liability Insurance (ALI) will be MANDATORY for all car groups.  Partial Damage Waiver (PDW) can only be declined with written proof of collision coverage with credit card.  PDW is the minimum protection required for the Avis car in Costa Rica).    He got heated saying his system says optional but clearly it was mandatory.  

After this I asked to speak with his supervisor who said basically the same thing. My point was you can’t “estimate costs”, decline insurance, and state nowhere about how certain locations have this hidden fee.  He said they have no governance over O-US locations and there’s nothing he can do.   I asked what to do in the futur he said call or speak with a CS rep.  Here is the kicker, I booked my reservation through Avis’s “virtual assistant” who ended up being a real person. So I booked completely through an instant message, per say.  That assistant asked about insurance and I said decline.  The CS manager had no answer for this and said “he must not have told you everything”?  Isn’t that a policy issue and do I have any leverage in this situation?

Any thoughts on this as I feel lack of transparent is a concern here.

- LA
- Seattle
- Dallas
- New Orleans
- New York

We are really hoping to drive a section (our initial thoughts were LA to Seattle via Portland, or Dallas to New Orleans), but as we were also hoping to come in the colder weather, we do have some concerns about driving through ice/snow, as we've had no experience (and I imagine the insurance would be more expensive too).
We were told also to consider a motorhome, but again we have no experience with that. Any driving suggestions are welcome (any alternate routes too). Is it cheaper to do a motorhome versus hotels and a rental car? Is it easy to find places to stop the motorhome (obviously clean, safe stops)?

Next is the time of year. We are eager to see basketball, ice hockey, NFL and baseball if we can manage (baseball is the lower priority), but I know that significantly limits the time of year we can go. We also don't know how easy it is to get tickets. We don't really mind which team or which city we watch in though.

Also any advice about the best/most efficient way to cover these places would be appreciated. We know we've basically picked the most broad spread of locations across the country. We're probably looking around a 3-4 week visit.

Any suggestions of things to do that aren't typical tourist attractions would be great. We're interested in really experiencing the cities as opposed to doing really ""tourist"" type stuff.

The total car ride is said to be 28 hours. With traffic, and yes there’s always traffic to and from Mexico during the holidays, it’s about 34 hours per trip. 

For this trip my brother and I brought along our gf’s. In total it’s 7 of us including me parents and kid brother. (In a Tahoe that sits 7) 

Now, to the point, is driving to Mexico safe? ABSOLUTELY! And this is coming from a kid who grew up terrified of absolutely everything (tornadoes, shootings, fights, etc) Not only that, but the Mexican people have a moral code to be polite to literally everyone. No cat calling, no one being an absolute prick to impress their friends, nothing. 

However, there’s a lot of things that might come off aggressive to tourist. Like the street vendors, window cleaners, and people who ask for money. Fear not my friends. There just trying to make a living and usually very desperate because of the poor economy. 

To reflect on my trip, and to reassure those who need it, Mexico is every bit of safe then any other country. Even with the cartel war going on, if you’re not involved in that shit, then the cartel won’t bother no tourist. Sure you might get mugged by a bum, but that happens anywhere mate.  

I write this post to educate and encourage tourist to travel to the beautiful country of Mexico. When I was leaving the States a bunch of my friends that I was driving to Mexico were all very concerned for my safety.

My girlfriend is spending a few weeks in Nepal as part of her uni course, the plan is for me to fly out and meet her for the last week, and we'll spend some time exploring (no mountain climbing!). 

I've booked two weeks off work, so my plan is to fly somewhere roughly on the way between the two places, spend a week there, then go on to Nepal. 

To give a bit of background, I'm fairly well travelled, male in my late twenties. I did six months backpacking in Asia- South East and Sri Lanka, I've also done Interrail for a month around central Europe. I've fine with cheap hostels, rough transport, etc. I love exploring cities, meeting new people, your normal traveling stuff. I'm a big history nerd, so historical places are great too. 

I've wanted to go to Iran for a long time, but it seems like flights would be difficult/expensive, and with current political events it may be a bad idea. I'd love to be persuaded otherwise... 

My ""safe"" option is Istanbul. I really want to go, it looks the best flight wise. On the other hand, I think it is somewhere I could do as a holiday with my girlfriend, I feel like I'll get another chance to go there one day. I have similar feelings about Israel, I do really want to go, but it feels like somewhere I could do another time. Also, I'll be on a new passport, and I know Israeli stamps can cause problems. 

I'm interested in central Asia, I've heard really good things from other travellers, it would be somewhere totally new for me. I don't know much about the region, I think my main concern would be finding somewhere that is worth going for just a week.

I do a very extensive planning, and at times I plan an itinerary even when I don't have any upcoming travel plans. I also enjoy taking inspiration from other people itinerary.

Although, I feel that there is too much information out there. Lot of effort goes into figuring out, what information is to be used and what is to be ignored. (List of tools I use are mentioned  at the end of the article)

&#x200B;

>Disclaimer: There is no perfect way to plan a trip. This is how I do it, and still there are lot more things to it, and one post won't do justice to it.  I would love to know how you plan your travel.

# 1. Shortlisting BROAD region or country to visit

***Below two factors*** in the order decided by personal situation and priority (*a must-try experience or activity* Versus *save some money*)

* **Interest / Flavour of the trip + Dates**

1. Activities:  Mountains / Beach / Museums/ History / Road trip/ Culture  (Adventure/ Relaxing/ Romantic / Family)
2. Dates of Travel: broad idea of month or holiday season

&#x200B;

* **Budget (number of travellers is a factor)** *( I travel economy and I stay in affordable hotels)*

1. Flight/ Train prices: broad range around $100 / $500 / $1000 two-way ( nearby / little far / very far)
2. Stay prices: broad range around $30 / $100 / $200 per night ($100 in Bali gets a private villa with pool VS a dingy room in Paris, but assuming a viable stay experience, some places won't offer anything decent for less than $200/300)
3. Intercity/ Intracity commute: affordable public transport VS semi-affordable car rental (toll/ one way/ two way) VS depends-on-location Taxi services VS expensive private drops (island destinations)

&#x200B;

    Output: Broad region or country which can be visited eg: Europe/ SEA / LatAm 

# 2. Narrow down on Country to visit

* **Decide on the primary/ landing country**

1. Flight search for deals around travel dates
2. Seasonality: not extreme temperature, not too hot (I prefer shoulder seasons)
3. Crowd: not very crowded, but also not deserted ( else, lot of attractions and restaurants are closed down)
4. Remove countries which have any safety concerns around travel dates

* **For tie-breaker between 2 destinations**

1. Popular festivals
2. Food preference
3. Language comfort and friendly locals
4. What wife says!

&#x200B;

    Output: Landing country for the trip is finalised

# 3. Book the onward/return Flight or Train tickets

* **Two-way flight**: if budget is a constraint + good return flight deal is available + not going to far away destinations on trip
* **One-way flight**: if return destination could be different then just book onward flight

with good research,  *(one-way to A + A to B + one-way from B)* **is cheaper than** (two-way from A)

*Output:* Flight tickets booked

# 4. Finalise Itinerary - Cities and number of days

1. Interests of yours and co-travellers
2. Commute time/ convenience
3. Return city is same or different (circular trip or linear trip)

I try to stay a minimum of 3 days in a city, so that the only things I remember isn't airport, transit, and hotel check-ins.

    Output: A day-wise and city-wise itinerary planned out in a shareable Google sheet, Excel or tool

# 5. Book Internal commute

Commute can broadly be

* **Public transport**: I prefer Trains/Buses in Europe, Flights in Asia/SEA
* **Car Rental**: Freedom to explore at will. Two-way rental only makes sense. Toll fee, Parking to be taken into account.
* **Private Transport:** Island destinations where the resorts arrange your commute

(An overnight commute, will save you from booking a stay in the hotel for that night)

    Output: Internal Commute booked and and added to itinerary tool

# 6. Book Stay or Hotels

This is the impossible trinity of stay. You get normally only 2 out of the 3 among ( Good Location, Good Amenities, Good Price)

* **Location or area** **of city to stay in**

1. City - Centre (nearby attractions, happening, expensive) VS Outskirts ( faraway attractions, quiet, affordable)
2. Prefer day-trips VS spending time in the city (parking is a concern)
3. Safety of area and connectivity

* **Amenities or comfort of Stay**

1. Hotel VS Hostel VS Airbnb ( meet fellow travellers, party, stay with locals, keep to yourself)
2. Amenities: Kitchen, Pool, Gym, Pet-Friendly

* **Budget or Price per might**

I research on hotel booking website and read detailed reviews.

    Output: Stay Booked and added to itinerary tool

ejm1dy|2020-01-03 21:26:03|Advice for 8 days in Taiwan in September?|"Howdy ya'll -- 

Time to start planning another trip and thought I'd pop over here for some advice as my general googling is yielding limited results, and a guided 7 or 8 day tour of the island is pricey, so the thought is can I do it myself?

I'll be flying in from mainland China (hitting a couple cities for family stuff) and flying back to the US at the end. 

* Getting around -- Public transit (and in a pinch Uber) around Taipei. But then once I get out of Taipei... How is driving in Taiwan? Both of us absolutely refuse to drive on the mainland because we're lazy American drivers, it's too chaotic. 

* Points of interest you'd recommend -- urban and historic sites of course, but also would be interested in nature (and don't mind an all day hike at all). Special interest in local wildlife (think like all the birds in NZ). 

* Did a quick search on here for itineraries and most folks were Taipei heavy. If I had to make a completely uneducated guess -- up to 3 days I don't mind, but then I want to do 4-5 days outside the city. I would have spent 3-4 days in Beijing prior to arriving so I'm gonna be done with big city life for a bit. Maybe would make sense to go into the country side right away - spend 5 days away, then come back to Taipei for a couple days to wrap it up since that's where my flight home is from. If ya'll got any itinerary suggestions that kinda follow this general flow - hook a brother up. 

Before you say that I can just as easily pop over to Japan instead for the same money and an easier flight home -- yes, yes I can. My reasoning is Japan will get it's own trip later - something a bit more comprehensive than 7 or 8 days, so this is a good excuse to hit Taiwan."|SpyCake1|False|https://redd.it/ejm1dy|4|0.83|0|3|1|travel

1.87m (6'1?) 30 year old. First time getting on a plane.

I'm wondering if it's worth it to spend in total USD 540 getting Main Cabin Extra seats on long (9+ hours flights). Bulkheads or first rows (not sure how to know). My flights would be like this:

Montevideo, Uruguay to Miami - Extra

Miami to LAX - Standard

LAX to Tokyo - Extra

Paris to New York - Extra

New York to Miami - Standard

Miami to Montevideo - Extra

Being fairly tall I'm worried I'll suffer on a standard seat, my mom is a lot shorter and she has gone to Europe and says airplane seats have so little legroom. Main Cabin Extra says they have up to 15 cm (6"") of extra legroom.

I land on a Saturday night and leave the Saturday night two weeks later. I tend to get overambitious with trips but I'm used to very busy holidays. Any advice on the below itinerary, including transportation between cities (this is where I'm getting confused on the timeframe)? Is train the best option here aside from the one flight to Goa?

Also, I'll be in Delhi for the Holi festival. I land on the night of March 4th- Holi is on Monday, the 6th. Is it reasonable to plan to leave Delhi that evening to head to Agra and stay overnight there to see the Taj at sunrise? Or will I want to stick around Delhi all night for the celebrations? I thought I had read it was more of a daytime festival.

First two nights- Delhi

One night- Agra/Taj, leave that evening to go to Jaipur

From here, I want to see Jaipur and Udaipur- do you think two nights in each is enough? 

Fly to Goa from Rajasthan

Is 3-4 nights in Goa too much? I get bored with beaches, but I love backpacker culture and partying/meeting people.

Last night or two in Mumbai

I'm traveling with someone who has free accommodation in Delhi and Mumbai, but I was hoping to start booking hostels/hotels for the other spots soon once I nail down dates. I was wanting to also see Varanasi or Jaisalmer, but I'm thinking I may already have too much going on here for two weeks.

As a western European I'll be facing some dark and cold months so waiting for that help probably won't be that easy. I hope that some sun will ease life in the mean time. I hope to go somewhere in february (for about 2 - 4 weeks) where I can just grab some sun and be able to keep remote working (as that is the only thing that is keeping me going right now). I'm sort of bound to western countries since the servers I need to connect to for work have (a bit too) strict firewall configurations. Europe is cold and has no real sun (maybe 15C on rare perfect days). I would hate to ask my employer and clients to take more risk because my current mental state demands it, if I go to Asia for instance.

I've been thinking about southern states of the US (California, Texas, Florida). A city would be nice because I'd have things to do around me, maybe some walks in a park, visiting museums and if I can handle it by then I may go to some hipster coffee place and work there. Some random town with a couple of local shops and a diner or two or even some house on a ranch would do fine as well. I'd just like to sit in relative privacy on a porch, a balcony or whatever to sit with my computer for work (reliable and basic unrestricted low-speed internet (15Mbit/s+?) would be necessary) in the sun or direct shadow and maybe it'll help me find some much needed healthy rest in my head.

Problem with that.. is that people usually call that a vacation and vacations are allowed to cost a shit ton of money. I know it will cost money and I know it will cost a lot. That's ok, but I still have stuff to pay at home as well (mortgage among other things) and a mental breakdown is enough.. a financial breakdown is not something I can add to my pile of shit right now. A max of 300-400$ a week for all-in housing (rent, electricity, water, internet) would be what I'm aiming for, as the flight will already be around 600-800$ and eating/living for 2 - 4 weeks will obviously also cost money as well.

The only thing I really need is a private place, hotel, apartment, room or whatever, sun (20C+? during daytime), a place to sit and work in private in the sun (balcony, porch, whatever), reliably internet and obviously something I may be able to afford. Everything else is optional really. I'm not bound to any location.

If you have any tips for me, I'd love to know about it.

We'll definitely go to Neuschwanstein on one of the days. Does anyone know of any cute hotels/lodges in the general area? Gondola rides?

I really hate coming back to my normal life back in the states despite having a great job. I get six weeks vacation on top of 11 holidays paid and my sick leave is separate as well. Needless to say, I have a job that lets me have some free time. I can combine a vacation with a holiday and take some 4/5 day trips easily throughout the year. 

I think what makes taking trips harder is the fact that my girlfriend always wants to go with me. We have been living together for six years and have no kids. I am 80% of the income. I really want to experience traveling alone but feel guilty about it. I feel like I could travel 2x as much and at 1/3 the cost if I go solo. Is it wrong to want to go without her? I guess this all depends on the relationship huh? I know many travelers go solo all the time with significant others left back home or they are traveling elsewhere. I'm pretty sure I have made up my mind and want to go without her. What is a good way to just tell her I want to go solo? The last time I tried to go solo, she quit her job and said she's going with me.

My sister (she's 22, I'm 25) and I are hoping to take a trip to Thailand and Cambodia this spring. We're in the early stages of planning at this point and haven't booked flights or lodging yet. Our tentative dates (these could be shifted slightly but generally we'd like to travel during these two weeks) are May 22nd, 2020 to June 5th, 2020. We're hoping to visit the following places...  


* Bangkok
   * \~3 days
   * perhaps a national park (Kanchanaburi or Khao Yai?) as a day trip
* Siem Riep/Angkor Wat
   * \~2 days

* Chiang Mai

I was advised that my Canadian friends enjoy a 72-hour visa-free stay during the layover, while I can only stay for 24 hours. This means if my flight from Bejing to Vietnam is cancelled, I cannot wait for the next day's flight because I would exceed my 24-hour visa-free limit, and thus I would have to buy a new plane ticket to leave China before my time is up.

Is this true? I ask because [this website](https://www.travelchinaguide.com/embassy/visa/free-72hour/) states that the whole country of Canada qualifies for the 72-hour visa-free stay. Does this apply to anyone travelling from Canada to China or just Canadian Citizens?

We’re flying out of Washington, DC and know that we don’t want the flight to be more than one stop (nonstop is obviously preferable).  

While far from being the most worldly people, we’ve both been fortunate to do a bit of travel.... Nicaragua, Mexico, Costa Rica, Australia, and “most” of Western Europe (UK, Italy, France, Germany. Austria, Switzerland, Portugal, Belgium, and the Netherlands) and feel like the world is too big to go back to any of these. 

In terms of what we want to do, we’re both active and would rather be hiking than in a museum.  We’d rather be drinking a beer with ski boots on than eating in a restaurant with a Michelin star.  You’ll never find me in a club at 1AM but a French vineyard at 4PM is heaven. We’d typically take the mountains over the beach and will always take a quaint town over a big city.  

The ideal day entails physical activity of some some sort (snorkeling, skiing, hiking, fishing, sailing, biking) all day long followed by a shower, a drink or two, and a delicious dinner.

We’re both reasonably experienced travelers and I don’t think there are many places anybody would suggest that I’d shy away from because we didn’t feel “safe.”  We’ve rented a car in Nicaragua and survived a mugging in Buenos Aires.  I live less than a mile from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.... does it get any scarier than what’s going on in my own backyard?

I’m not really worried about the budget.  We’re never going to opt for a luxury hotel but I’ve got no qualms about spending money to get somewhere and to enjoy the activities once there.

My friends from uni and I are still pretty close and they all turned 30th this year except me and another friend that have very close birthdays at the end of April.

With this nice trick we’ve visited London, Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon this year. My friend and I are undecided on where to go - we are considering Barcelona again as we have friends there and we wouldn’t be “burdened” by wanting to visit the city which would make the short weekend more complicated in a way when we mostly want to eat drink and chill in peace. We are also considering Berlin as it’s a pretty great city that none of us know too well but have been already. 

Some of us would leave from Rome, some from Milan, my friend and I from Holland and Bruxelles respectively.

Basically we’d like to pick a city that is not too expensive to reach, not too expensive to buy a nice dinner for a few people and to spend two nights, is overall fun, and ideally would have decent-to-nice weather and even a decent chance to find some weed. Italy excluded (we’re all from there).

ej5mpq|2020-01-02 22:39:47|Which hotels/towns in Crete and Naxos for honeymoon?|"My husband (30) and I (27) are planning our belated honeymoon to Greece for June 2020. We'll be there for 2 weeks with the following itinerary:

&#x200B;

* Days 1-3: Athens
* Days 3-6: Naxos
* Days 6-11: Santorini
* Days 11-14: Crete

&#x200B;

We've already picked our hotel for Santorini (we're staying at Kapari Natural Resort in  Imerovigli), but we're struggling a bit with Naxos and Crete. We definitely want some quality beach time, but we also love meandering through old towns, eating the best authentic food we can find, and hiking. Since it's our honeymoon, we do want to relax, but we both have very pale skin and also get bored on the beach for too long, so I imagine spending 2-3 hours per day on the beach and then site-seeing the rest of the day. With that in mind:

&#x200B;

1. In Naxos, do you recommend staying in Naxos town or directly on one of the nicer beaches (e.g. Agia Anna or Agios Prokopios)? If in town, does anyone have thoughts on Nissaki Beach Hotel? It's a 5 star hotel, but doesn't look \*that\* amazing. That said, the price is much lower than a 5 star would normally be so maybe it doesn't matter. Any other hotel recommendations either in town or on the beach?
2. In Crete, do you recommend staying in Chania Old Town or on the beach? Any particular hotel recommendations? As we're ending in Crete, we'd like it to be special and we're willing to splurge on a nice hotel. 

&#x200B;

Overall, if we only stayed in towns and did day trips to the nice beaches, would we be missing out on the Greek island experience? Should we pick at least one island to stay on the beach even though, as mentioned, we'd probably only spend 2-3 hours/day on the beach?

All of these trips have been great, but we are looking to see some different parts of the world that aren't old world Europe.
For past trips, we have preferred renting a car to easily have the ability to see whatever we want on our own time and don't really want to be stuck on a tour for much of the time. We have also gravitated towards seeing relatively smaller historic towns (like Arcos de la Frontera, Rothenburg, and Assisi), castles, and scenic areas, rather than just the big cities and museums. We like to cover a lot of ground and see as much as possible and aren't really looking for a beach-type relaxing vacation or to stay in one place the whole time. We usually tend to stay in a place for 1-2 nights and move on to the next.
We'd like to change things up for the next trip but are thinking we'd still like to be able to easily get around on our own, see historical sites and scenic areas, get a feel for traditional culture, and not necessarily be in a huge modern city for much of the time. Since we prefer to be our own travel guides and mostly get around on our own, we're also looking for something relatively safe and where some level of communication is possible.

I also don't much like hot climates, and the fact Tasmania is cooler helps make it more attractive to me. That a lot of it is protected in a country not known for how kind its been to nature doesn't hurt either. I can also explore around the small islets around the mainland that might be cool to see.

While I was always going to go there when I went to Australia, I'm now debating making it the entire two week trip. I'm flexible about what time of year to go, so open to advice about that too. But mainly whether I can make it worth my while to spend two weeks in that state. Good idea?"|AllthingsnonAmerican|False|https://redd.it/ej4xlk|1|0.67|0|8|1|travel

We just got our finances under control after we both finished uni an wanted to see if we had overlooked anywhere that mainstream holiday sites don't like to show you, so far we have mostly been drawn to Majorca in Spain.

Here is a list of things we would like to have:

* Not a massive language barrier - (The place doesn't have to be English first language as long as it's common to speak English)
* Sunny beach holiday
* Good hotel, 4/5 star
* Preferably for adults/couples only
* Budget is about £1k - £2k per person (\~$1300 - $2600) for travel & hotel + spending money
* Near by water parks & theme parks
* Good local restaurants
* Doesn't need a massive amount of vaccinations to visit (I have a compromised immune system, however this isn't a massive deal)
* I'd love to rent a jet ski and go on a boat tour or something, also I'd love to scuba dive again.
* As for things to do, interesting villages/cities and fun activities as my gf gets bored easily, touring ruins might work once.
* prices are not too high, I'm happy to pay for quality as long as i don't feel ripped off.

Any ideas that I can look into would be great.

This article ain't gonna give you all the answers, although it may help you with your travel planning and point you out a couple of interesting places that you don't know of. I will share with you some of the places that we’ve visited during our stay with some photos and brief descriptions.

https://preview.redd.it/u0opg6wqnm841.jpg?width=4608&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca08b89a4acbe9a247e93c8f6c3c80da6f4413d3

You can choose between four types of experiences in Thailand:

* Water activities like visiting a variety of unique islands, beaches, boat trips, snorkeling or scuba diving.
* Visiting Thailand's natural wonders (hot springs and natural emerald lakes), beautiful national parks, jungles, finding your hiking trail or hidden temples.
* Urban experiences - partying, enjoying the nightlife, visiting Bangkok, Pucket or any other big and crowded city.
* Relaxing in amazing hotels located in the jungle, having daily massages, visiting night markets, going to a tailor, taking cookery lessons or just finding *your* *place* that will bring you peace and joy.

* All interesting activities can be booked from the hotel, and it depends on you how comfortable the actual thing would be. Always check *what* is included in the price and try to negotiate it (if you want) in a polite way. The end price depends on the number of activities that you pay at once. TBH, they expect you to bargain :)
* Most of the tours take half-day, which means that you can leave something else for the evenings as well, like visiting the local markets, having dinner in authentic restaurants, night bars, or attending a muay-thai match.
* Don't fully trust the weather forecast, for our November stay it was supposed to rain every day for a couple of hours, but it didn't (light 60-minute rain is nothing).
* Have **Travel** **Rest Days,** or simply put a time to recharge, refill and reflect. Thailand is a different and unique country, and you should be aware of what’s happening around you and be mentally and physically in good shape in order to better enjoy it.

ej080x|2020-01-02 16:17:46|US travel ideas - flexible time and money|"Hey all,

In short, part of a company bonus for working here 10 years is a company paid trip. It's $10k to do whatever you want. I'll be setting aside $2500 for taxes, the rest is usable.

My wife and I are from the midwest, but have rarely left our state. Our bucket list is mostly overseas, but that'll eat our money fast, and we're trying to limit the vacation to 4-5 days. We have a 2yr old at home that will be staying with grandma, we don't want to push that too far.

In short, we need ideas for travel in the US with ~$7500, it'll be through a travel agent the company has. Not worried about logistics.

We love history, but not necessarily museums. We love parks (Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, Redwoods, etc), but don't intend to hike the trails all day (or climb a mountain). Maybe a couple hours walk and a picnic. 

Possible options brought up by my CEO were:

1. California. (Fly there) Hit Monterey Bay, the coast highway, and potentially the Redwoods. There would be enough money to rent an exotic car for a couple days (my dream). That would be free flowing enough to do whatever we wanted, we'd just need to hit the hotels we anticipated and the flight home. The Monterey Bay aquarium looks pretty cool. He highly recommended the Spindrift Inn as a romantic overnight stop.

2. Oregon. Less specifics on this, but small towns, Redwoods, still coast highway.

3. Jackson Hole, WY. The access to Yellowstone/Grand Tetons, we'd surely go for walks. Could stay in a nice 4 Seasons. Hit the small town for food. This gives us the lounging/relaxing but also  with things to do.

4. Thought about Hawaii, but we're not beach people, plus long flights sort of killed this thought. We'd love to see Pearl Harbor, but that's really the only attraction for us besides potentially driving around the island.

I'm actually leaving this job soon, so I thought my restriction on time was basically by March the latest. The CEO said I earned it, they'll still pay for it even if I left, so that opens the whole year. I'd like to aim for mild weather if possible, if it's too hot (90F+) I doubt we'd venture outside for very long.

For reference, our last vacation (and honeymoon) 8 years ago was to the CEO's condo in Colorado. It was in Vale and off-ski season, and we loved it. Basically spent it lounging around the condo with amazing views, and had a small town to go into for food and a break. That was fun, but we're hoping to spend this trip doing something we'd likely not have another chance to do with kids.

Another thought is we both love fishing, but we've been limited to the muddy waters of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Rarely we travel across the state to spring fed waters. It'd be a nice bonus if a place we went to had a fishing 'tour' or 'guide' (since I won't pack and take all of our fishing gear).

I know this is potentially wide open across the US, but having never travelled, I have no idea what kind of out of the way places there are that fit what we like. For example, I know nothing of the East Coast. Fresh lobster sounds amazing, but that's all I got. And lots of big cities which we'd want to avoid."|ShadowedPariah|False|https://redd.it/ej080x|2|0.67|0|16|1|travel

Any Advice on my tentative itinerary or recommendations greatly appreciated!

At first, I was looking at trying to go all over the place, but I've since decided that may be too much driving, especially as I'll be going alone.

I'm still undecided on my route, but am leaning now towards spending between 2 and 5 days on the north island. Day 1- Auckland; 2 - Waitomo; 3: Tongariro crossing if possible; 4/5 - Coromandel/coast. This may be too much so I may just do Coromandel/Waitomo but the crossing looks awesome.

Days 6-16 would be in the south: 6 - Straight to Arthur's Pass. 7 - Punakaiki/Westport; Days 8-9 - Lake Angelus trek; 10 - Farewell Spit; 11 - Abel Tasman day hike by Takaka; 12 - Nelson; Day 13 - Marlborough wine/bike tour; 14 - Kaikoura; 15 - Christchurch, fly back end of 15 or early 16 to Auckland.

eizwe0|2020-01-02 15:52:38|Looking for some advice about this trip im planning|"So I am trying to figure out when I should go to New Zealand. I don't mean like ""what is the best time to visit"" I mean should I wait until the fall allowing me more time to save money or do I work more now and go in May 

First I need to decide if I'm going back to school to get my degree or if I want to join the workforce. If I go in May this decision does not matter, if I want until the fall then it certainly matters.

Spring Trip: 

So in order to pull this off, I would need to work a min of 3 days for my dad and whatever the fuck hours I'm getting at my other job (currently 1 a week). Now I know this is very easy work since it's currently would result in 25 hours a week. However, I value my time a lot and have no desire of getting up at 7 am 3 days a week from next week until the end of April. 

You then have to factor in I would have about $500 left (factor in gas and other expenses that I pay) and that I would be joining the workforce once I get back. Now if I want to have a better chance at getting a better job I would need to move out since I can then apply to jobs not just in my area.

To sum up, the may goal, 

work 25 hours- have $1300 left before other expenses (gas and whatever I want to buy). I would be starting my career once I get back (so June). Have no desire to get up at 7am from next week until end of April 

Fall Trip: 

The only way this is possible is by working for my dad during the summer. So I would go back to my regular plan for the rest of the school year of not working for him come to the end of Feb (currently do 2 days a week). The may problem with this is I don't know if I'm going back to school. If I do then I have tuition and rent and shit to pay for. If I i don't it's highly unlikely I could book 3 weeks off of work.

eiqqbc|2020-01-02 00:57:07|Traveling to Japan for the very first time in May for 27 days . Really excited as a History major|"Tokyo, Nagoya, Nara, Osaka, Kobe and Hiroshima are the places I am planning to visit. 

I've a really good friend in Osaka who says I can stay a week in Osaka and I have a pal who will let me crash for 2 days in Nagoya. So, I'm looking for reasonably priced Air B n B's in the other cities for around $20/night. 

I finished my History degree last month and I'm eager to explore a few museums along the way like the samurai museum in Tokyo. I also wanna experience the Robot Restaurant even though the price is incredibly high ($72 or so). 

The situation with transporation confuses me. I see that the JR Pass is good for 7/14/21 days. So, I'm just thinking if it's really useful as I planning to go from Narita Airport to Osaka, then Osaka to Nara, Nara to Osaka, Osaka to Kobe, Kobe to Hiroshima, Hiroshima to Osaka, Osaka to Nagoya, Nagoya to Tokyo. 

I don't mind walking a lot while in places like Nara or Nagoya or Hiroshima. I imagine in Tokyo, it'd probably be impossible to just walk everywhere so I look forward to enjoying the subway there as well as in Osaka. 

My friends keep recommending Yoshinoya as it's incredibly cheap. I've had it once in the US and liked it. I'm not familiar with Japanese food other than that one experience so I do wanna try new things as well. 

what might you recommend i bring with me? I'm traveling on a budget for sure. I was thinking $1500 might be good (including the price of the 21 day Pass if I go for it) but then maybe $2000 to be safe."|KevTravels|False|https://redd.it/eiqqbc|8|0.8|0|46|1|travel

My event/experience planning skills are VERY MUCH non-existent. This actually bring on a lot of stress for me. This all being said, I really do want to force myself out of my comfort zone and travel solo.

How do I find a flight and what are some of the things to look out for?

How do I find cheap hostels to stay at, and how do I book them? How much in advance do I need to book them? How much do they typically cost?

Without knowing the languages of the countries, how do I get around? Order food?

Do I travel with a backpacking backpack? If I do, do I bring my tent and sleeping bag with it?

Is there Uber in most countries, and is that how I should get around?

Should I bring my laptop?

How long should I stay?

These are questions I have, among many many others. Looking online, I never know if what I’m reading is relevant to my situation... I almost just need someone who’s done it before to almost... coach me. Or give me the foolproof roadmap of how to travel solo on a foreign continent.

If it’s possible, I’d like to just... book a one way trip to France and travel around to neighboring countries until I run out of budget money. However I feel like that loose of planning might just cause more problems than solutions.

Do you think hostels should have some policies to keep this from happening or is it legitimate that a hostel would be populated with as many homeless people who can pay for it?

We would prefer to visit the two places in 2 separate days. Our budget is somewhere below $500 for 2 of us. We would prefer to travel in small groups. 

So far I found these two deals: 

 [https://greatoceanroadmelbournetours.com.au/tours/2-day-great-ocean-road-phillip-island-tour/](https://greatoceanroadmelbournetours.com.au/tours/2-day-great-ocean-road-phillip-island-tour/)

These have good prices, but it seems like we would travel in very big groups. Another option we are considering is booking 2 separate tours for those 2 places on AirBnB, which currently run at $159 AUD per person per tour.

We have two weeks in early May. We will have a 4 month old baby, so we are looking for something pretty chill.  My wife would love to spend some time on a beach or someplace warm; I would love to go some place new where I can check out a new culture, historic site, or environment. We are open to long flights, but it would need to lead to something pretty amazing to spend 24 hours in transit with a baby (Palau, maybe?). We are thinking about Belize because it is close and we could spend time on the beach and in the jungle.   If we went some place closer & cheaper, we would consider bringing a young single friend to help watch the kid so we could spend a few afternoons and evenings childfree. We have around $10-12k for the two weeks. If I don't use the money I  have to send it back. 

We live in the Pacific Northwest and are pretty seasons travelers.  We spent 5 years living in the developing world. I probably prefer to go to some place I have not been before. We have been to almost every country in europe, we have done SE Asia, and lots of the Middle East. I have been everywhere in in Central America except belize, and a bit of South America. My wife's only travels in Latin America is in Mexico. We have not done much in Africa, Central Asia, or Australia, but that is all pretty far away.

&#x200B;

I am in a bit of a dilemma and could use some serious help.

Last week I bought my girlfriend a surprise trip to Chicago through Expedia. I made sure to purchase the Trip Cancellation Insurance just in case she was not able to go. Turns out, she is not able to go. After gluing the pieces of my heart back together, I tried to get my money back for the trip, thinking that it would be an easy process with the insurance that I bought. WRONG. Apparently the only reasons that a trip would be 100% covered are the ones listed below in Bold. Expedia is suggesting that I cancel the trip and get no refund, then submit my claim into Travel Guard to see if they will reimburse me. This whole process seems very silly to me and I feel like it would make more sense to get a sure answer on what, if anything, would be reimbursed. 

Has anybody ever had any experience with this or have suggestions as to what I should do from here?

I am posting because I have a few questions, specifically for Canadians who have traveled to the Kurdistan region of Iraq. And yes, I am aware of Canada's travel advisory. I have been travelling for almost a decade so I am confident in my ability to travel safely.

My citizenship/passport is Canadian. I am looking to potentially travel for a week, around April or May of 2020. Budget is not an issue for me.


My main question is regarding the Visa. According to Wikipedia, IATA.org, the website of the Kurdish government, and also the tour guide who I have contacted to potentially hire, Canadians can get Visa on arrival at Erbil airport. However, the Iraqi embassy in Ottawa is saying that I need a regular Iraq Visa in advance. My main issue with this is the potential of showing up at the airport (Ottawa) and being denied boarding, even though the Kurdish government itself has stated that a Canadian should be able to get the Visa on arrival. Have any Canadians had this issue when boarding at a Canadian airport? I went to IATA's website, since Air Canada implements their standards, and after inputting my information, the resulting page said that Visa on arrival is possible for me, but I wanted to ask someone who has actually done it.


My second question is about vaccines. Lots of websites are saying that I would need the yellow fever vaccine if travelling or transiting through a country with a high risk of the disease, which I am not. I would have a layover in Austria, but that isn't a high risk area either. I am wondering if any other vaccines are needed, and what kind of documents to bring for proof. I am asking this because I can barely find any info on vaccines, and the employee at the embassy in Ottawa did not particularly seem to know for sure either.

&#x200B;

Day 1: Fly to any city in Lapland and arrive at Saariselkä by car. Sleep in Saariselkä.

Day 2: Urho Kekkonen national park (**undecided on which hiking trail to explore yet**). Sleep in Saariselkä.

Day 4: Drive to Kilpisjärvi (275km), departing at 10am. Arrive there around 2pm. Have lunch, explore nearby places and most of all, see the Saana mountain (**not sure if it is feasible to climb there in winter, if it is then we will have to change our plan, e.g. sleep in Kilpisjärvi**) clad in sunset. After sunset, i.e. around 5pm, depart from Kilpisjärvi and hunt northern lights on the way back to Kittilä. Sleep in Kittilä.

Day 5: Pallas-Yllästunturi national park (**undecided on which hiking trail to explore yet**). Sleep in Kittilä.

Day 6: Pyhä-Luosto national park, Ukko-Luosto hiking trail (2km). Sleep in Kittilä.

I am looking for suggestions for a bachelor party destination for a party of 8. Budget is a ~$1500 per person. Staying for 5-6 days around July. 

Looking to do a lot of bachelor party oriented activities. Hoping for a villa with a pool but that’s not a priority over night life. We want to party but also relax and have options to do things during the day. 

We’ve eliminated Barcelona, Lisbon, Berlin and London because a lot of the guys have been there already.

Hvar, Croatia - I like the villas with pools and night life seems decent

Split, Croatia - same reason as above

Budapest - great nightlife destination but we won’t get a place with a pool within our budget

Prague - same reason as above

Tokyo - not in Europe but it’s an option that’s currently being entertained

I plan to stay 1-2 nights in urban cities where it’s easy and relatively cheap to Uber (meaning everything is not too far from each other). I would rent a car if it came down to it, but not in a city where traffic is wild or have roads like San Francisco. 

I enjoy bar hopping, wine tasting, or breweries. As she is a little more introverted, she really just likes scenic areas or anything video game/anime related. Food is a big factor for us. We love all sorts of ethnic food, but asian food the most. Hoping to stay in the states since it’s our first trip. She’s a little antisocial so it’s not like we will be at the bars the entire time. Anywhere with cool attractions where we can finally take cute pictures together too is what I’m looking for! 

So far I have Seattle, Portland, and New York in mind. I’ve never been to the east coast but would love to, just can’t think of anywhere else but NYC. I thought about San Francisco but we’ve both already been with family before so it’d be nothing new. 

I would say not including plane ticket and Airbnb/hotel, our budget combined is just $1200. We don’t necessarily want to go all out as we just want to sightsee and eat, maybe get some small souvenirs too.

When I questioned him further he revealed that he was trying to come to terms with the idea of what I thought his impact on the world was. 

For background, he is a Puerto Rican that moved to the states at 19. My mother, before meeting him, moved to the states around the same time from Guatemala. They lived their lives to figure out how to build a family in the land that had roads paved of gold and gave me and my sister more than they ever had and took joy in being able to do so.

Now that he is nearing 70 he, I guess, is trying to find a way to validate his life experience, and I guess he hasn't taken the time to reflect on it for himself in a meaningful way. When he asked me flat out how I would measure his and my mothers' impact, I got caught off guard and responded as best I (30 M) could. 

So I said, it just depends on what metrics you want to measure impact. 

Objectively, you were a part of the hispanic wave that lead the way for the growth of the American economy through the 90s even though it plateaued in the 80s.

You could also look at yourselves as individuals and know that you and Mom met your goals.

From my perspective, you guys worked your asses off to give me and my sister the tools needed to be able to do whatever we wanted or needed, so as a father what more could you want to give your children.

To conclude, all I said was, possibly naïvely, was all I know was that fathers lay down on the barbed wire of progress to make sure their families and subsequent offspring can move beyond them and that's why it's a bit of a thankless job, but because of you, I will happily lay down on that wire when and if we decide to have kids.

\---

Travel has given me so much. My life, my career, and my beautiful girlfriend. I never thought it would allow me to get closer to my parents, but, in their heart of hearts they have always taken my extroversion in stride. 

This is the first moment of my adult life that I have not only been acknowledged as an equal, but as someone worthy of an opinion to provide perspective.

I just wanted to share, and ask all of you if there were moments in your travel where you realized that your flits of fancy or meanderings across the world ever ended up validating themselves because of how you were treated once you came home.

We usually take a week-long trip as a family in March. Me, my wife, and kids, 11 and 8. Usually we just want to relax and soak up some sun. We love the beach, and don’t typically take a lot of day trips or activities. In the past we’ve gone to Miami Beach, Sarasota, Florida, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Tulum, that sort of thing. 

We don’t love mega-resorts, and tend to look for smaller properties. Last year in the DR we rented a 2-bedroom condo right on the beach, near restaurants and shops, and it was perfect. 

This year, we have an Au Pair living with us for the year. She’s super flexible, and probably willing to rough it, but the rules are that she has to have a bedroom to herself with a door that locks. I think this rules out a resort, so I’ve been looking at VRBO, AirBnB, etc. 

The practical and economical thing is to rent a condo in Florida somewhere, but that feels a little tame and I’m tempted by some listings I see in Riviera Maya, Costa Rico, Jamaica and so forth. 
	
So… do y’all have some tips for a fun beach vacation? Priorities are: 

Direct flight from NYC
Easy journey from airport to accommodation	
Lots to do nearby (restaurants / shops)
3 bedrooms
Would love to be right on the beach, or within a short walk.

Fully appreciate it's not the ideal scenario, however the Tourist Card seems to be an additional slip of paper (vs being stuck into the page) so I don't think it will run into the issue of having 1 page visa/1 page entry/exit stamps. Does anyone know roughly what the risks are here?

eiiljj|2020-01-01 14:00:03|Planes and trains in France (Bordeaux, Paris)|"Hello r/travel, I am planning a two week trip to France from the US this April, spending six nights in Paris, four nights in Amboise, and four nights in Bordeaux. I will be traveling with my wife and baby daughter. My hotels are booked and I am now working on the logistics of getting to and from France. If I book airline tickets round trip from JFK to CDG, they are $800-$900 a ticket. If I book a multi-city trip, JFK-CDG, BOD-JFK, the price goes up to $1200-$1300 a ticket. Therefore, I’m thinking of getting the round trip ticket then taking a train from Bordeaux to Paris to catch the flight home. Based on train schedules I’ve looked at, taking a train from Bordeaux to the center of Paris is a 2.5 hour trip, but taking a train from Bordeaux to CDG is a 5 hour trip. Does anyone know what accounts for this time difference? Would taking the metro from one of the Paris train stations to the airport with luggage and a baby be a nightmare?

Flying from West Lafayette to Orlando will take about 4.5 hours. (1h drive to airport + 1h checking in and boarding + 2h flying + 0.5h getting off the plane) Driving will take about 18 hours, and we are only going to stop for food and bathroom (we are going to get there in one day).

I prefer to fly, but my friend is saying that we should drive to save money and that we would be spending a lot of money on transportation (we are too young to rent a car), so it would be better to bring his car. 

Cost to fly will be around $100-$250 per person depending on ticket price changes, so assuming that we would spend $200 on gas and that we would spend $600 on transportation if we didn't bring hour car, we would be saving $800 -$1400, so $200-$350 per person. I don't think that 27 extra hours of just traveling just to save $200-$350. People say that road trips with friends can be nice, but like I said, we are only stopping for food and bathroom.

It was great, he was very informative and explained so much to me about local culture and history, certainly more than I would have expected from a tour guide. I really enjoyed the tour. At the end, he claimed the price was 3x what we agreed on. 10 minute argument ensues, I finally agree to just pay 2x what we initially agreed upon. I probably should have held my ground more, but I was tired and it was honestly still not that much (by USD standards.)

ei3qoo|2019-12-31 14:48:09|Suggestions for long-term Western/Eastern European itinerary and logistics.|"My wife and I (USA, mid-30s, no kids) want to take a gap year(s?) and travel after she leaves her job in the spring (teacher). We bought an RV and drove around the continental US/Canada/Alaska in 2017 and it was amazing; now we want to travel overseas. We were in Europe a few years ago (Brussels, Paris, Switzerland, London); I've been to Berlin/Munich/Amsterdam; we really liked all of it. (LOVE Switzerland).

We want to see Iceland, UK, south of France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Greece, and anything cool in Europe. That's vague I know. 

We love beaches, mountains, hiking (anything nature!), and history. Our favorite experiences have been ice-climbing a glacier in Alaska, helicoptering/hiking tour to see Alaskan Grizzlies feeding on salmon, hiking ""The Narrows"" in Zion National Park, things like that. Then again we also love NYC (for short periods). We can tolerate crowds for a few days but not continuously.

Suggestions for places would be great but here are some logistical issues I'm concerned with.

* We'd be traveling with an 18 lb French Bulldog. Googling tells me that small dogs are allowed on most express/city trains in Europe but I'd be curious to hear personal experiences. We'd fly her over there (she has flown quite a bit). I don't think she's allowed on the Chunnel train; we'd have to ferry.
* AirBnbs can drop by 50% if you choose at least a month's rental vs. the daily price, so that's what we're looking at: picking maybe 6-10 spots of a month each, and using that as a home base. We're looking at mid-size cities. I liked Paris/London but not sure I'd stay there for a month.
* On our RV trip we moved every 3 nights (over 100 campgrounds in a year) and were getting burnt out by the end. Would like to avoid that.
* Are there other options than AirBnB over there? We do not want to share housing, live in a community hostel, do a work-stay program, etc.     
* I'd like to average < $1,800 for a month's housing rental, and $4k-$5k total spending per month. (I've done many AirBnb searches and it appears common for $120/night places to go for $60/night if you rent by the month.)    
* I'd really rather train everywhere but I'm open to buying a small RV in continental Europe if driving isn't too crazy. We are very experienced RVers. I'm a little concerned about trying to fit stuff for this long trip (and our dog's stuff) into a few backpacks!    
* I'm concerned about overtourism/crowds, and I'd rather visit things in off-season. In other words, avoid Alps in the winter and south France in August, avoid Amsterdam except maybe for a weekend, etc.    
* We were thinking Iceland (Schengen), then UK (non-Schengen), then western Europe (Schengen), then Romania or another non-Schengen country so that we stay within the 90/180 Schengen rules. However we'll be starting this trip in June, which is peak Iceland tourist season. So I'm trying to pick a good solution.    
* My business is mostly automated but I need to get online and check on it every day. I also do remote software development contracting work for US-companies, but I think this is outside most tourist visa rules. We could survive for ~1 full year without working if necessary.    
* We are in good health.    
* We only speak English (not counting high-school level Spanish and French). We are natural-born US citizens.    
* We'd like to stay in reasonably safe areas, where there's no issues walking home from a bar at night for example. This is why we picked this region of the world. If it goes well we may do this in South America or elsewhere.    

TL;DR: if you could pick 6-10 spots in Europe to use as a home base for a month apiece, that are centrally located to several weekend-type excursion opportunities (especially nature-based), what would they be?

eifnbr|2020-01-01 07:29:23|The plane ride from hell|"Let me tell you the story of the worst flying experience I have ever had. It starts with a flight from Atlanta to Montreal.

I had spent the holidays visiting my family in Atlanta and I was ready to return to Toronto. My itinerary went: Atlanta to Montreal, a two and a half hour layover in Montreal and then Montreal to Toronto. That morning I had been feeling seriously sick with something flu-like and threw up early in the morning. I had almost taken this as a sign that I was not meant to fly today and delayed my flight, however I didn't want to pay the fees associated. So I thought I'd take a ton of Nyquil and try to make it work. I also take some other meds regularly because I have mental health issues. 

The flight leaves at 3pm. At this point I am dosed up on meds, I ate lunch at 11 am and all is well. Because this is a tiny plane they make me check my carry on bag which has my meds in it. They don't think it will fit in the overhead. I'm supposed to arrive in Montreal at 5:30 and I was planning on grabbing lunch there. The beginning of the flight is turbulent but not horrible. All is going okay.

Then the captain announces that he doesn't think he can land in Montreal because the runways are too icy and there's a snowstorm going on. He tells us that he's going to make a few attempts and then if he can't make it, his backup airport is in Burlington, Vermont. Things start getting seriously turbulent here and a almost throw up a few more time. Finally he says that he can't make the landing and we're headed to Vermont.

The landing in Vermont goes fine. At this point I assume that I'll have to reroute but it won't be a disaster. We land at 5:55 pm. At this point I'm slightly hungry and my meds are starting to wear off but it's nothing too bad. I can grab some food and next dose of meds in the airport while I figure out my next move, right?

No. They refuse to let us off the plane. Communications are scrambled with the Montreal airport telling the pilot that everything is too icy to land there are the Burlington Airport telling him that it's fine and he can land. No one seems to know what's going on. A large portion of the plane are French speakers with a less than stellar grasp of English. They have no idea what's going on as none of the crew speak French. My French is good enough to understand how confused they are and bad enough that I can't translate effectively.

After more than an hour on the tarmac we hear from the Burlington Airport. Apparently they can't let us off in Burlington because Burlington doesn't have a customs to handle processing. I'm a freaking US citizen on a flight that started on the US and landed in the US. This is ridiculous. I have been on this plane sitting on a runway for more than an hour. I am hungry and I do not have my meds. I am hacking up my lungs on this plane. Many people are running out of power on their cellphones and can't keep up communication with their families back home. Fortunately I'm able to partially charge my phone from my laptop and I offer my phone to anyone who needs to send a text message. 

Another half hour passes. The crew starts handing out water and potato chips, however they only get to the front of the plane. I do not get any water or snacks. Instead before they reach the back of the plane, they say they're going to make one more try to go to Montreal. The captain sounds audibly dubious and he tells us that if he can't make it to Montreal he'll be heading to JFK where there are at least customs. Customs for a flight that took off from the US and landed in the US.

Another half hour passes. They do not actually begin de-icing the plane so I'm fairly sure they aren't actually planning on taking us anywhere. At this point it has been slightly over two hours on the tarmac with no food or water. It has been 9 hours since I have had any food, 3 hours since I've been able to get any water and 5 hours since I've had access to my meds. Needless to say I miss my Nyquil.

Finally at 8:15 after 2 hours and 20 minutes on the runway they let us off the plane to head into the airport. Burlington is a tiny airport and there are only two people manning the desks this late at night. They are absolutely besieged by everyone having questions and complaints. I try to be polite and wait my turn. They say that the flight will be continuing to Montreal at 10:45 once they get a new crew in. At this point after 3 hours I finally get some water. Food and meds are still elusive though because the airport is all but shut down. 

 I missed my connecting flight to Toronto long ago. Nobody mentions anything about the connecting flights and how I'll get to Toronto. I start looking things up on my phone. Turns out my flight from Montreal to Toronto was canceled due to weather. In fact all flights from Montreal to Toronto for the next several days are canceled due to weather. If I go to Montreal, I will not get to Toronto.

I rebook myself for an alternate flight path the next morning. Burlington to New York to Toronto. It's not great but it'll get me there. At no point does anyone from my airline point out the problem with my original flight path. No one helps me with finding an alternate route. The airline however refuses to help me pay for my hotel because this is ""unavoidable weather related delay."" so I end up having to pay for a hotel room out of pocket to spend the night. At this point it's 9 pm and it has been 10 hours since I have been able to eat and 6 hours since I have had my meds.

I ask the airline representatives for my luggage so that I can head to my hotel for the night. She tells me that my luggage has to stay in the plane to Montreal. This is around the point where I have a mental breakdown and start crying in the middle of the airport while she tries to tell me how convenient it'll be to have my luggage delivered to my address in Toronto. I just want my damn Nyquil and antidepressants. Also toothpaste would be nice.

After half an hour of this, the airline has pizza delivered and I finally get food after almost 10.5 hours. Not everyone gets to eat though because there are not enough gluten and dairy free options for the number of people we have with who can't eat pizza. Another half hour and I finally persuade her to give me my carry on with my psych meds in it. I still don't have toothpaste but at least I have my Nyquil and can stop with feeling like my brains are dripping out of my  nostrils.

I head to the hotel and get 5 hours of sleep before I go back to the airport. As I leave to get on my plane to leave this hell, I see a line of Francophones from last night still trying to get on another flight somewhere, anywhere but the Burlington Vermont airport. I wish them the best of luck. Now I'm waiting for my plane to be de-iced."|Throwaway-flyaway|False|https://redd.it/eifnbr|0|0.39|0|11|1|travel

I'm looking to see if anyone has a certain website or method of keeping information and an organized list of destinations they want to see, and places that they have seen. My list is abismal. It's just a check list that says Spain, Japan, California, etc. 

I'm just wondering if anyone on here has a cool or fun check list system that makes it fun to plan, daydream, or organize future and past travel ideas.

For the record I'm not a big fan of new York either. Someone attempted to pick pocket my wife but she caught them and they ran off. We went to go meet up with a friend at hotel costes but the staff refused to believe me and just asked if I had a reservation or if I was staying at the hotel and promptly kicked us out (no phone service for overseas at the moment so I couldn't call him). By that point I was over it and this guy attempts to walk between me and my wife on an empty sidewalk while we were holding hands. I say ,""wtf"" and he replies with ""what do you mean wtf? Fuck you"". So I shove him and he backs off. My wife tells me it's not worth it and she's right. He was probably someone else trying to pick pocket. Also, did I mention how expensive Paris is? 17 euro for 2 shots? Damn I miss those German prices with a shot being 3 euro.

Now Amsterdam....if you've been you already know. Everyone is extremely helpful and nice for the entire 2 weeks I've stayed there. The streets and city itself is super clean. The prices are reasonable. It was very very busy when I went and even then staff at establishments were outstanding. We walked into some steak place and asked if they had a table. The waiter was like, ""we're already booked up but I'll tell you what. One party isn't coming until 9pm so you can have that table until then."" I know it's not exactly the same situation but it was the closest I could think of. 

I don't know, maybe I just had a rare experience yesterday. Today is a new day and year so I'll go out and give it another shot."|Effective-Computer|False|https://redd.it/eigt2g|0|0.29|0|15|1|travel

Am I the only one who does this? What are some other odd hobbies you do that are related to travel?

Edit: I just felt like adding some context as to what made me feel like posting this thread. Yesterday I was lurking around Oman on google maps after watching a youtube video by Eva Zu Beck about her road trip through Oman and I found it so cool to see that there were so many castles throughout the interior of the country in all of these small towns. I also just learned about Al Ain and Fujairah in the UAE which is neat to me because usually when you think of UAE you think of Dubai and Abu Dhabi and that's it. Heck just now I was lurking on google maps again and discovered Hatta Dam near the Oman border which looks really beautiful in pictures.

I'm planning a trip to Italy for the first time in mid-May. I usually like traveling solo but this has been my first trip with some family in a while. Here's my plan so far:

* Fly into Rome from Canada
   * Spend 4-5 days there
      * Thinking of staying in Trastevere - I've heard a lot of good things about this area
      * 1 day at the Vatican
      * 1 day seeing the main attractions - Colloseum, Roman Forum, Palatine Hill
      * 1/2 day - 1 day seeing the Spanish steps, Trevi fountain, Pantheon, Piazza Navona
      * An extra day to walk around and explore everything else
* Take a train to Florence
   * 1.5-2 days
      * Not sure if this is enough time - THOUGHTS?
      * Check out the Uffizi
      * Stroll around and check out the city
* Take a train to Venice
   * 1 day
      * Walk around and just explore - no concrete plans

I really wish I could stop by Genoa or the Dolomites but I'd be short on time. We'll be heading to Berlin by train after this but I'll save that for another post. I know a week in Italy may be short.

eib0on|2020-01-01 00:01:35|My nightmare flight with easyjet yesterday|"I hope the flair is okay, since my advice (as written at the bottom) is to avoid flying with easyjet. Little extra: If you can, don't fly over London Gatwick either because that Airport sucks imho. But thats a different story.***Tl;Dr at the bottom***

A little pre-story:I traveled from the states all the way back to germany. its a long travel and was supposed to be about 21hrs plus 4 hours to get *to* the airport and another hour to get home from the airport. So about 26 hours of traveltime almost all by myself, except for the 4 hours. My very last flight was with easyjet from london gatwick at which i arrived at about 2pm. (btw London Gatwick is not a good airport, avoid it if you can) i had a 4 and a half hour layover there and was supposed to fly from london at 6pm London time and would arrive in Dusseldorf airport at 8:25pm german time. which never happened that way but read below.

I had contacted easyjet about how badly the flight went i had to take yesterday. They didn't reply to the wall of text I had sent them. But on a different post of someone else, where I had commented later on too, they answered which clearly showed that they did read the post.

Their comment was this:

>I'm very sorry to hear about your experience MrsFoober (name changed). Due to the huge complications involved in safe air travel delays and cancellations can be difficult to avoid, and can happen very suddenly, especially at this time of year. I'm also very sorry that you weren't offered a light refreshment voucher after 2 hours. To claim compensation, and reimbursement of expenses you will need to complete the relevant web forms at the bottom of the page here, [https://www.easyjet.com/en/help/contact](https://www.easyjet.com/en/help/contact)  
>  
>Apologies again, Robbie

&#x200B;

**The post that I had made on their page was the following wall of text:**

Yesterday, on the 30th December 2019 I was supposed to fly from London Gatwick airport to Düsseldorf airport. Departure was scheduled for 18:00. Since I had a layover for about 4hrs 30min I had some time to kill.At about 16:00 I checked on the status of my flight and saw that it was delayed for 20min. Nothing too bad. Happens.Just 15min later (16:15 London time) it was already \~40min delayed. It's a bit annoying but happens right? So I just wait patiently since the gate for the plane hasn't even been posted yet.

At 17:45ish the gate for the plane EYZ8803 was finally postet to be at 112. At the Gate, at about 18:10ish, the employee of easyJet, that was preparing everything for boarding at the gate, kept us updated about the situation of the plane, since it was delayed for 45min so far.He still announced that **boarding should start soon**, even though there was **no plane** to be seen yet.

At 18:30 the employee **started the boarding process**. (30min past the scheduled departure)There was **still no plane** at the gate though. And neither this employee nor his partner were really knowing what was going on, still had started boarding and let us **passengers pile up in front of the door**, which was closed, that would lead us to the gangway to get on the plane.We waited there behind the desk for 20min(!) with closed doors in front of us and, since we were ""boarded"", no possibility to sit down. *Neither of the two employees seemed prepared for a situation like this* and didn't seem to know what was going on. Communication obviously was not happening.

At 18:50 the **doors to the gangway to get to the plane were finally opened**. Just for all of us passengers to be stuck in the cold hallway. **No one got on the plane**. We saw crew members getting off the plane but no one was allowed to board of the passengers.The employees responsible for boarding just **kept checking boarding passes and boarding us** passengers.Us passengers waited in this cold hallway, with no other possibility to sit than the floor obviously, for another 25min(!!).

At 19:15 we were informed that the **plane has a defect** and that all of us had to **go to Gate 101 to board a different plane**. We had been waiting since 18:30 (when boarding had started) to get on a plane mind you.At the new gate all us passengers waited and were rightfully annoyed with all the chaos that was happening.

At 19:45 (1hr 45min past scheduled departure) I asked the, now 3 employees (2 from easyjet, 1 from airport gatwick itself) **what kind of compensation** we would be to expect when we would pass the 2hour mark. There was a sign on the desk posted that informed us passengers about our rights to ask for compensation if the flight would be delayed for more than 2 hours.

**None of the 3 employees could give me a definite answer.**

One of the easyjet **employees suggested to send an email** about this whole ordeal to you easyJet. ***I asked if the employee would give me the email address but he told me he didn't have it*** and that I should check the website. Which I did, with no success. The only thing I could find was the claim website of easyjet which makes you go through a whole process that isn't even all that transparent. It asks you to give all your information, full name, address, bank information. As complicated and unappealing for dissatisfied customers as possible. Good move easyjet 😉👍🏻 (careful sarcasm)

**I asked for water (past the 2hour mark** by now) since I didn't have anything on me as I hadn't expected a long wait like this. The airport employee referred to the shops and restaurants. I told her that I meant that if they would provide some free water for us since we have to wait here for so long.I remember from a flight two years ago from Vienna to Düsseldorf, where my flight was delayed almost two hours, that the employees started getting ready to have to provide free water for the waiting passengers and even informed us about the situation, if the plane had been delayed more.

Anyway, the employees told me that had **no means to provide free water** as they **""didn't have the possibility nor facilities to do so""**. Which is, excuse my language, bullshit as airlines have to be prepared or at least have to know how to provide for situations like this as it does happen that flights get delayed or even cancelled unexpectedly. Yet, you easyjet, didn't seem to have prepared your employees for a situation like this AT ALL.

There were vending machines just a couple steps away from the gate we were waiting at as well as the shops/restaurants where someone could have provided us waiting passengers with at least some water.

There were quite a few elderly people as well as young children on this flight, easyjet. But we got nothing, just the answer that we would get ***a*** free drink and a free snack on the plane! 👍🏻

At 20 o'clock we were informed that, due to the curfew at Düsseldorf airport, our flight would be **redirected to land in cologne** instead of Düsseldorf and that we would be ***met with busses in cologne to be taken to Düsseldorf airport.***

At 20:30 (2 and a half hours after scheduled departure) the **boarding process finally started.**

Just minutes before, another passenger had asked for water as it is EU LAW for airlines to provide for the customers in cases like this which was retorted by the airport employee because boarding was about to start. The phone had rung and she answered it and made a *snarky comment* about said **passenger for ""making a last minute issue""** (that's how she worded it) on the phone to whoever was on the other line. I had suggested she could call someone who would be able to get something in motion about the ""issue"" but was blatantly ignored. Somewhat understandable as we are all human and it was a stressful situation, yet very unprofessional as things like this expectedly happen if passengers are made to wait for almost an hour, standing around just to be redirected to a different gate!

Okay now, the time is 20:30 and people are starting to **get on the plane** now, with no problems. Everyone is finally on a plane. Only problem is, because of issues about being allowed to finally start and take off, the **plane was stuck at the GATE(!) for an HOUR!!** All of us passengers were sitting and **waiting ON THE PLANE**. We got our drink and the snack which understandably they ran out of fairly quickly, so not even did all of us get what we had picked from the menu.

And I can tell you, after being stuck at the airport since 2pm I was not just thirsty but also hungry. No shitty snack makes up for the chaos that had happened so far! I took the free drink as I was seriously thirsty, but had given the tiny box of Pringle's to another passenger as I really did not feel like eating chips but ACTUAL food. The stewardess told me they are not allowed to serve actual food while at ground.

At 21:38 the **plane finally started to taxi** to where we had to go to finally take off. Because of a plane ahead of us we were **standing for another 30min somewhere in the middle of the airport**.

At 22:11 the plane finally took off. 4 hours and 11 minutes too late. Plus the plane isn't even going to the right airport because we had to be redirected.

At 12:20am (German time) we finally got off the plane in cologne airport and were met with two busses. We were taken to the passport/ID control at cologne airport, **not entirely sure what exactly had happened to our baggage**.The passport control was obviously packed as there were other people from other flights trying to get to the baggage reclaim as well.

At 12:50am I had finally found my baggage.All of us **passengers were left alone without an employee** anywhere near us who would tell us **how we would get to Düsseldorf now**.I asked other passengers which told me that **supposedly the bus driver was supposed to pick us all up** from the conveyer belt where we picked up our baggage. So I waited along with the other passengers.

At 01:05am the **bus driver found us** and escorted us to the two busses we would take to Düsseldorf airport. The bus drivers waited for about 20 min to ensure that everyone got on the busses.

The two **busses arrived at Düsseldorf** airport at 02:10am.

I was supposed to arrive in Düsseldorf at 20:25! On the 30th December and not in the middle of the night of the 31st December!

I got to my destination 5 HOURS and 45MIN TOO LATE.

Do you want to know how this whole ordeal has negativley affected me?

If I had arrived at normal time in Düsseldorf airport my younger brother would have picked me up there and would have accompanied me home, as it is quite unsafe for a young woman late at night to be traveling on her own back home through big cities like Düsseldorf. Because of this whole chaotic mess though, I was sleep deprived (I was traveling for over 35 hours at this point),hungry, thirsty and alone in the middle of the night in a big city. I had to take a train back to home ALONE since I absolutely did not want to make my LITTLE brother wait at the airport for almost 6 HOURS just to pick me up.I actually had some bad experience previously on exactly that tour in the middle of the night. I was really not happy about potentially having to repeat this experience!

If everything had gone well I would have arrived home at about 21:30ish. Instead I arrived home at 03:45!!

Easyjet I can assure this was the first and LAST time I was flying with your airline, so I WILL NOT accept any sort of vouchers as a compensation for this horrortrip!

I demand proper compensation and that someone, meaning an actual person, of your customer service gets Into contact with me.

Sincerely,

MrsFoober

PS: TO ANY POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS:I absolute advise to NOT fly with easyjet as they obviously are NOT prepared AT ALL for situations like this, and WILL NOT take proper care of their customers!

**Tl;Dr** : had a horrible flight with easyjet. They did not give out free water even though we had been waiting for more than two hours. The employees had no idea how to deal with the situation at all and acted *very poorly.* The flight got redirected to a different airport and in the end I was about 6 hours later at home than I was supposed to. And I had to find my way home alone in the middle of the night at 2-3am.

My recommendation: avoid easyjet. And London Gatwick Airport. It's not worth the discomfort and stress.

Edited for easier reading.

***Edit #2: My main issue with what all happened and the reason it was such a wall of a text is just how bad the whole situation was handled by the employees. If it had simply been the delay and diverting of the plane it would have been one thing, shit happens. But None of the employees did shit for anyone and just made the whole thing a proper nightmare, more than it needed to be.***

ehutg8|2019-12-31 00:23:37|First Trip to Europe Help.|"Hello, I live in Albuquerque New Mexico and I'm planning my first trip to Europe. I've never been out of the country so I'm excited to visit new places. I've also never planned a trip this big before so I have some questions and I'd like some help/advice.  I will be traveling most likely with a few friends for the first part of the trip and my girlfriend for the second part. I'd like to visit for about 20 days in October because I've read that the weather is nice, most attractions are open, and the crowds are generally smaller. I'm planning a budget of $5000-$6000 for flights, rooms, food, attractions, and souvenirs. I'm planning on visiting 4 locations; London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Rome (in that order). I'm thinking of staying 4 days and 3 nights at either hostels and/or cheap rooms on Airbnb at each location. I've put together a rough itinerary that I'd like some input on.

Using Google Flights  I've got a rough idea of the flights cost. First I'll book a round trip flight to New York city because it's cheaper to fly in/out of NYC than Albuquerque, and that's about $250. Then a multi-city flight from NYC-London-Amsterdam-Paris-Rome-NYC will be about $600. I'll more than likely walk and use public transportation like buses and trains to travel within the city.  

&#x200B;

London

1. Harry Potter set Tour.
2. Big Ben, Tower Bridge, London Eye,  Jimmy Page’s house, Abby Road, Kings Cross station
3. Buckingham Palace/Changing of the Guards
4. Westminster Abby
5. Sight see and shop

Amsterdam

1. Anne Frank's house
2. Van Gogh Museum
3. Heineken Tour
4. Sight see and shop

Paris

1. Louvre
2.  Arc, Notre Dame, Eiffel tower
3. Catacomb Tour
4. Palace of Versailles
5. Pantheon
6. Sight see and shop

Rome

1. Vatican City
2. Colosseum, Roman Forum, Trevi Fountain
3. Spanish Steps
4. Sight see and shop

&#x200B;

Is this a feasible itinerary? 

Am I packing too much into each location? 

What would you change/suggest?

Should I continue planning my own trip or consider doing a European Tour Package?

&#x200B;

This is just a rough itinerary that can be changed and altered if needed. I also have no problem paying extra to ""skip the lines"" with fast pass tickets for some of the attractions and museums. I also figure that some of the bigger attractions/tours/museums, such as the Vatican and Louvre, will take most of the day to complete. I would prefer to fly to each location so I don't waste a day by traveling, but if it makes since to travel some other way, such as trains, which locations should I travel to by train? Does my route from NYC-London-Amsterdam-Paris-Rome make sense or should I plan on a different route?

&#x200B;

ehsx7r|2019-12-30 22:02:23|Tromsø, Lofoten Islands, or Svalbard trip (Summer)|"Hi! If anyone has experience with Northern Norway, I'd love some advice planning a trip:

I'm planning a trip with my mother to see the midnight sun this coming summer and I'm considering these three locations! We'll be there somewhere between June 25-July 10 for about a week, coming from Copenhagen. 

As far as activities go, we're definitely interested in **hiking, seeing nature, maybe a boat trip through the fjords, and eating good fish**, and from what I can tell, this is pretty possible in all three! I originally was just thinking Tromsø, but I've seen many people online recommend Lofoten over Tromsø, though I can't quite tell why. As for Svalbard, well it's just sort of a fantasy that I've always had of visiting the high arctic, but I recently saw that getting there is not so horribly expensive or difficult so I added it to my considerations!

  
**Important note**: I cannot explain to you why, but my mom has always been completely smitten with the idea of seeing the complete midnight sun (not just kind of light at midnight, but that disk approaching the horizon and going right back up without completely dipping below), so it's very important that I plan a trip with the greatest chances of seeing this. I don't fully get it, but it's important to her so it's important to me. I **do** know it's not always possible due to weather, but I want to give us the best chance at it. 

Here's my understanding of all three:  
**Tromsø**

* Easier, cheapest to get to (1 stop, $200-300)
* Medium sized city with more restaurants, museums, hotels, etc.
* Plenty of infrastructure for tours, activities.
* Easy to get around
* Beautiful, but less pristine nature than other two?

**Lofoten**

* Much more difficult/expensive to get to (either 2 stops flight, flight+drive, flight+ferry, $500+)
* Less town, more wilderness than Tromsø
* More beautiful?
* Most southern, least complete midnight sun chances

**Svalbard**

* Easy to get to, but more expensive than Tromsø (1 stop, $400-500)
* Smallest town, even more wilderness
* Highest chances of midnight sun
* HIGH arctic (ie. so cool but also colder)
* Need to book more things, as you cant really go off hiking on your own (can't leave town w/o rifle)

We are a group of 4 friends deciding to backpack Vietnam in Feb end/March beginning for 12 days. This is the itinerary we have planned so far:

Day 1: Land in Hanoi and transfer to Ha Giang City

Day 2-6: Ha Giang Loop and Ban Giac Waterfall, Cao Dong.

Day 7-9: Transfer to Cat Ba and Lan Ha Bay tour/Go for Bai Tu Long Bay Tour (We want to avoid HaLong as we have heard it is touristy and polluted). Can you suggest which one of the two is better?

Day 10: Hanoi sightseeing and move to Phong Nha

Day 11-12: Explore paradise cave and other places around Phong Nha. Farmstay there.

Day 13: Transfer back to Hanoi and flight back from Hanoi

I had a few questions in mind regarding the itinerary:

1. I looked at area around Ninh Binh and that seemed interesting as well. I am just not sure if that area is worth visiting after Halong Bay. Does Ninh Binh have a different vibe and is it worth a visit after Halong Bay?

2. I had a similar doubt around Phong Nha but I believe the farmstay and caves would be a different experience than Halong? Or do you suggest skipping this as it will be repetitive?

3. I researched about Sapa but did not find it that interesting. I believe we will get some views of rice paddies in Ha Giang Loop itself. Or do you think Sapa is a must?

4. I was also looking at the places like Hoi An/Hue/Danang in central Vietnam. They are interesting but seem a bit far. Is there a way to include one of these places using the overnight train or will all that be too hectic?"|bk2910|False|https://redd.it/ehxkf5|0|0.5|0|12|1|travel

1. Good food. Street food, fancy food, spicy food—we are not picky. We want to go wherever has the best food. 
2. A fancy beach experience. My husband and I are both young professionals in our 30s and this will be our honeymoon, so we want to spoil ourselves for at least a few nights at a fancy resort and relax by the beach. We don’t dive or care about nightlife. We just want to hang out by the beach. 
3. Ease of travel. We don’t have a lot of time, so we don’t want to spend it coordinating tickets/schedules and traveling between destinations.

Because of that, I chose to base ourselves in Venice and Florence, while taking day trips to the surrounding areas. I cut Milan from the trip because I heard overwhelmingly bad feedback from people who had been there. I think that helps in keeping the trip simple.

Ultimately it comes out to this: 1.5 days in Venice proper, with day trips to the Venice Islands and another TBD location. Train to Florence, with 2.5 days in Florence proper, with a day trip to San Gimignano and another day trip to Cinque Terre. Then off to Paris.

I know neither of us want to be around kids on the vacation so that helps narrow it down to couples only and adult only resorts. But as I've been reading reviews and as much info about these resorts as I possibly can, I realize info is still left out that would be good to know.

For example, my boss and his wife went to Couples Negril last Feb and a few years before that. Reading reviews about it online and looking at all the amenities and pictures make it seem perfect. But an interesting bit of info told to me by my coworkers is that at 42 years old, they were the youngest couple at the resort by a few decades. I personally wouldn't want to be exclusively surrounded by geriatric couples. But none of the extensive reading I had done on the resort had hinted to that at all.

So now I'm asking the people of reddit for recommendations and experiences for things like this to help make a better informed decision. Or even giving me a better idea of how to research to find things like that out.

ehm6wx|2019-12-30 13:43:14|Paris and Moscow vs. Paris, Berlin, and Prague|"I recently realized it's fairly affordable to fly from Chicago to Paris, then onward to different European cities. Much more affordable than it is for me to fly directly from Chicago to any of the secondary places I listed. 

I plan to use my Christmas bonus to book a trip and am unsure of which one to do! I plan on spending approximately 2-2.5 weeks on this trip. I would fly from Chicago - Paris (overnight flight), and spend a few days there. Then from Paris to either Prague or Moscow, and end my trip with a week or so in either location. Then I'd fly home from there. 

I'm really torn. Paris and Prague is the more affordable option by far. Its only like a $150 price difference, but still. Moscow has been my dream since I was a little girl, though! I've already been to Germany, but I only did the western side (Frankfurt, Cologne, Heidelberg, and more). I would fly into Prague, then stay with a friend in Dresden to save money. I'd likely then rent a car (adding to the cost of my trip), and drive around and visit Berlin, more of Czechia, and more of the eastern part of Germany. 

I also have a friend in Moscow with whom I would stay. I would NOT rent a car in Moscow (I looked and it's like 1800USD for a week or something equally insane), so I would have to rely on my friend (who might be able to drive me places on the weekend), and public transportation to get me anywhere else I wanted to go. I really was hoping to go from Moscow to St. Petersburg, but I always forget how big Russia is! So not sure how feasible that is.

I'm just wondering, what's going to be more affordable, and what is going to have more to see/do? I feel like Berlin and Prague might be better, only because I have no idea how public transit and everything in Russia is. Any tips or advice are welcomed! I would be flying in May or June.

ehs90g|2019-12-30 21:13:53|Critique my itinerary|"Giving out silver coins to whoever gives me the best advice. 

Planning a 30 day trip with my spouse to NZ, Australia, and Bali. Background, we both travel a lot and have been in foreign countries a ton. I’ve been to Australia (only in Sydney) and NZ (Queenstown, Milford Sound, and wandering the South Island for a week) a few years ago.

Likes: food and drinks, sight seeing, food/ shopping markets, walking around to see architecture/ art, astro/ scenic photography when able.

Problem: We are looking at flying into South Island NZ to get married in Wanaka on April 1st. We’re trying to figure out from there how much time to dedicate to the following areas: North and South Island NZ, Sydney, Cairns (or Whitsunday), Melbourne, and Bali.

* Fri  3/27 - United
* Sun 3/29 arrive Queenstown 12:05 pm 
* Sun 3/29 - Tues 3/31 - Queenstown 
* Tues 3/31 - Thur 4/2 - Wanaka 
* Thur 4/2 - Sun 4/12- North/ South Island in RV 
* Sun 4/12 - AUK - Sydney 
* Sun 4/12 - Wed 4/15 - Sydney 
* Wed 4/15 - Sydney to Cairns 
* Wed 4/15 - Sat 4/18 - Cairns 
* **Sat 4/18 - Cairns to Melbourne** 
* **Sat 4/18 - Tues 4/21 - Melbourne** 
* **Tues 4/21- Melbourne to Bali** 
* Tues 4/21 - Sun 4/26 - Bali 
* Sun 4/26- Bali - Home

***To give more detail of what we plan to do it will be more like this:*** 

* Fly to Queenstown, visit with wedding photographer and such, a day to view the city and get some rest.
* Wanaka - wedding day and additional day to see the town/ scenery.
* 7 nights - RV South Island; Milford sound, Mt Cook, and driving/ seeing sights along the west coast. 
* 4 nights - RV North island, 1/2 day winery tour, hot springs, beaches, glow worm caves, and a day in Auckland. 
* 3 nights - Sydney - Mostly tourist things for the spouse, opera house, bondi & manly beach, etc. 
* 3 nights - Cairns - we are diving the GBR but trying to decide if we should go to the Whitsundays instead. 
* **2 nights - Melbourne - see the city and make a day trip to the twelve apostles along the GOR. This is where we feel we could cut time to dedicate to other parts of the trip.** 
* 5 nights - Bali - renting a scooter, seeing as much of the area as we can while staying out of Seminyak.

I’ve combed this sub trying to determine if I should cut Melbourne to extend time in NZ or elsewhere but this sub seems to be pretty divided on how they feel about Melbourne. Any additional tips or info on where to stay/ what to see during this trip is appreciated.

I know that all three of these islands are vastly different, but I have read mixed reviews on each... especially Curacao.Since we will only have 5/6 days, we were leaning towards either Saint Martin or Curacao, as St. Lucia seems to have the most to do hiking/sight-seeing wise. (Our #1 would be St. Lucia if we had a few more days).

Curacao... I have read very mixed reviews. I found a wonderful Airbnb on the west side right on the water, but I have read in some spots that it's pretty overrated and not really sure what to believe. The beaches are nice but not great, it has some sight-seeing but not a lot, and the restaurant scene is sub-par.

In Saint Martin, we would stay in Grand Case, so it would be nice having all the restaurants around compared to staying on the southeast end of St. Lucia or west end of Curacao. St. Maarten would be a nice place to relax on the beach and eat nice food, but it can get a bit more crowded than the other two. We would definitely take a day trip to Anguilla as well.

Overall, we're looking for a more quiet place with nice beaches, a lot of relaxing, and good eating. Water sports would be fun, and we would certainly do some snorkeling if we end up in a nice spot for it.

Would going to St. Lucia for 5/6 days be worth it, or should we stick to the more-touristy Saint Martin or the more low-key Curacao?"|smking7|False|https://redd.it/ehogi2|0|0.4|0|12|1|travel

If I am stopped in France will there be a warrant for that ticket?

Well, I didn't pay in 3 days, and when I reached out and offered to pay the original amount ($150 euro) they said no.

ehkl2n|2019-12-30 10:42:35|need advice on planning a trip for a group of college students|My friends and I are planning a Europe trip in either June or July for around 12 days, but my group has clashing interests, which makes it hard to pick a place to go. Some of them mainly want to party and go to clubs/bars and the others would rather explore around the city and do more adventurous outdoor activities. I was thinking Madrid would be a good place to go because I have family that we could live with for free, which helps loosen up our budget, and from what I have read, it seems to not be as expensive as the rest of Europe and is a good middle ground for my groups' interests. That being said, I don't really know that much about Madrid or traveling in general, so going there could be a bad call. I also don't want to be bothering my family with all my friends for 12 days, so if anyone has any recommendations on other places to go or activities to do please let me know! thanks|newprt|False|https://redd.it/ehkl2n|0|0.4|0|3|1|travel

\- 4 days Uluwattu/Canggu/Seminyak/Kuta

\- 3 days Gili Islands

ehe36t|2019-12-30 00:19:19|Looking for advice on a rough draft of my 3 week Europe itinerary|"(Note: I [posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/efq3fe/looking_for_advice_on_a_rough_draft_of_my_3_week/) on /r/solotravel  as well - just updated based on recommendations and looking for more opinions thanks!)

I'm planning a 3 week (19 days technically) vacation in Europe.

I've come up with a few basic itineraries but I know that it's probably optimistic and a tad bit crazy :). So I'm looking for any advice people can provide. 

I'm flying into and out of Lisbon and the tickets are already booked so I cannot change that unfortunately. I have no idea why I picked Lisbon... I just did. 

I've already been to Switzerland, Belgium, Northern France (Paris, Bayeux and around), and parts of Italy (mostly just Florence and Rome) before. I want to see different parts. 

I'm not a huge fan of beaches, surfing or summer stuff so that's why I'm skipping or not spending too much time in most beaches and surfing towns.

What I do love is food (well most... not a huge seafood fan), history (I went out of my way to go to Verdun a couple of years ago as an example), and nightlife. And also I'd like to see the basic tourist attractions at least the first time. 

The places that I consider a must in this trip are: Porto, Naples (for Pompeii), Krakow (for the Auschwitz museum) and Amsterdam. Yep all over Europe.

**Itinerary 1:**

* Arrive in LIS 1/19 night
* 1/19 - 1/22 - Lisbon
* 1/23 - 1/25 - Porto
* 1/26 - 1/28 - Seville
* 1/29 (night) - 1/31- Naples (Pompeii tour on 1/30 or 1/31)
* 2/1 - 2/3 - Krakow
* 2/4 - 2/6 - Amsterdam
* 2/7 (eve) - Back in Lisbon
* Depart LIS very early 2/8

So that's 4 nights in Lisbon (first night is a wash), 3 nights each in Porto, Seville, Naples, Krakow and Amsterdam.

**Itinerary 2:**

Same as #1 except 1 fewer night in Krakow in favor of Amsterdam

So that's 4 nights in Lisbon and Amsterdam, 3 nights each in Porto, Seville, Naples, and 2 nights in Krakow.

**Itinerary 3:** (No Seville, More Naples) 

Based on advice from /u/elstampcollector, I'm considering more time in Naples to really discover the Amalfi coast. Yes it's winter, but that's probably better with fewer tourists. In order to do this, I cut out Seville (and thus Spain except for a few hours in MAD)

* Arrive in LIS 1/19 night
* 1/19 - 1/22 - Lisbon
* 1/23 - 1/25 - Porto
* 1/26 - 1/30 - Naples, Pompeii, Amalfi Coast, etc
* 1/31 - 2/2 - Krakow
* 2/3 - 2/6 - Amsterdam
* 2/7 (eve) - Back in Lisbon
* Depart LIS very early 2/8

So that's 5 nights in Naples/Amalfi, 4 nights each in Lisbon and Amsterdam, 3 nights each in Porto and Krakow.

**Itinerary 4:** (No Seville, but add Prague)

Same as #3 except adding Prague (only 2 nights 1 day tho). 

* Arrive in LIS 1/19 night
* 1/19 - 1/22 - Lisbon
* 1/23 - 1/25 - Porto
* 1/26 - 1/30 - Naples, Pompeii, Amalfi Coast, etc
* 1/31 - 2/1 - Prague
* 2/2 - 2/3 - Krakow
* 2/4 - 2/6 - Amsterdam
* 2/7 (eve) - Back in Lisbon
* Depart LIS very early 2/8

So that's 5 nights in Naples/Amalfi, 4 nights in Lisbon, 3 nights each in Porto and Amsterdam, and 2 nights each in Krakow and Prague.

**Itinerary 5:** (No Seville, No Amalfi, just add Prague):

Basically cut out Seville but keep Naples to 2/3 nights and take the rest for a good 3-4 nights in Prague. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I realize that this is crazy but it's not often I get a huge block of vacation and I want to take advantage of it. All travel will be via flights (except Lisbon to Porto) so I won't be spending days on a train. 

Any thoughts or tips on these basic itineraries? I was originally leaning towards 1 or 2 but honestly I'm now thinking 3 or 5. Basically this becomes a West-Central Europe + Portugal trip instead of all over. 

Should I increase or lower time in any of these cities? Or go somewhere else?

Thank you!"|royrules22|False|https://redd.it/ehe36t|5|0.63|0|20|1|travel

This trip will likely be from a Wednesday (arriving) to a Sunday (departing) \~2.5 weeks later. This would give us 18 nights in Italy with 17 complete days. Currently I have the following itinerary with several different options, it would be great if people with experience can comment on the different options:

&#x200B;

**Days 1-3:** Fly to Venice, stay in an Airbnb, explore the city, enjoy the cuisine and the nightlife

\- if flooding is still bad then we may skip this altogether and start somewhere else, does anyone have any other recommendations? We're not really interested in visiting Milan.

**Option A (maybe remove this altogether?):**

**Days 4-6:** Take a train to Verona, stay in an Airbnb in Verona, explore the city and cuisine, take a day trip to Lake Garda and do a wine tour in the Valpolicella region

\- is it worthwhile visiting Vicenza or Padua, or would you recommend Verona over them? Time seems to tight to do more than one city, unfortunately.

**Option B (maybe remove this altogether?):**

**Days 4-6:**  Take a train to Bologna, stay in an Airbnb in Bologna, explore the city and cuisine

\-  is it worthwhile visiting either Ferrara, Ravenna, Modena, or Parma or would you recommend Bologna over them?. Again, time seems to tight to do more than once city, unfortunately.

&#x200B;

**Days 7-10:** Take a train to Florence, again explore the city, I want to also visit wine country here in Montalcino but I'm not sure if this is too out of the way

\- is it worthwhile visiting either Siena or Lucca, or is Florence enough?

&#x200B;

**Days 11-14:** Take a train to Rome, stay in Airbnb in Rome, explore the city

&#x200B;

**Days 15-18:** Take a train and bus to Positano, explore the city, maybe spend a day going to Capri, leave the 19th day (fly out through Naples?)

&#x200B;

This seems like quite a lot and I'm not sure if the time frames are reasonable even for 19 days, but I'm finding it hard to decide which city to remove, I would think one of the first two, which would give us a few more days to either shorten the trip or spend more time elsewhere. I think spending time in Positano is on our wish list so it would be great to somehow incorporate it. Your feedback is greatly appreciated :)!"|supersymmetry|False|https://redd.it/ehfp99|2|0.75|0|14|1|travel

-Fly directly to Pamplona (expensive!)
-Fly into Bilbao, catch a train (is there a train?)
-Fly into Barcelona, catch a train
-Fly into Madrid, catch a train

I'll be flying from the US.
I'll be spending most of my time in and around Pamplona, and while I'd love to see more of the country, Pamplona is my main focus.
Which of these options is best time-wise and cost-wise? 
Is the train easy to navigate?

My S/O and I are in the planning phase of scoping out our 7 Wonders of the World tour.  I know that multiple lists exist, so for the sake of clarity these are the 7 we are planning on visiting (a mix of natural and ancient):

1. Great Pyramid of Giza/Sphinx - Egypt
2. Great Wall of China - China
3. Petra - Jordan
4. Machu Picchu - Peru
5. Chichen Itzac - Mexico
6. Mt. Everest - Nepal
7. The Great Barrier Reef - Australia 

Edit 3:

Adding New possible destinations to the list:

Angkor Wat - Cambodia

Colosseum - Rome

Taj Mahal - India

I'm looking for any advice/insight/recommendations my fellow Redditors can share related to any and all travel logistics i.e. lodging, tour guides, airfare, places to avoid, etc. for these destinations.  And if there is a location that is not on this list that you would recommend, we would happily consider it!  I have found some online resources from some basic Googling, but  the sites we found leave a lot to be desired.  Our plan is to document every step of our trip to share with our fellow Reddit travelers should they also choose to undertake in this same journey.  Thanks all!

Edit:  We are planning on breaking these up into 4 separate trips by geographical location over a few years.  For example, 1 trip will consist of Petra and Giza.  Our 2nd trip will consist of Machu Picchu and Chichen Itzu.  I agree with everyone that doing all 7 in one attempt would be exhausting and incredibly time consuming.

Edit 2:  Also, if we could get recommendations for best time of the year to visit these locations that would be incredibly helpful.  Thank you!"|george_tuna|False|https://redd.it/ehgmvt|0|0.5|0|6|1|travel

Where I live owning is cheaper than renting and I plan on staying here the next 5 years. 

I know people will say that owning holds you down. I've always had a crazy idea in the back of my head about getting up and moving across the country to somewhere cool and living on my own for a bit. But in reality I see my self staying put for the mean time. 

But with owning a house especially a rental property there can be a lot of hidden costs/repairs. That in itself could limit travel funds. 

Time isn't that big of an issue due to me having 3 weeks yearly of vacation. I do have a crazy idea of taking a gap year in the future to travel. But I figure that'll take a few years to save for. I could always sell/ rent out the property down the road and go travel then.

I would like to experience venice without the flooding so I was thinking about going this march for my last spring break. However, I would have a shorter time: 1.5 days in florence, 1.5 days in venice, and 4 days in rome.  I may be able to add an extra day to one of those cities but I'm not sure.  I'm also not sure how soon I will get a job after graduation but if I do I don't know if I would be able to get time off in march to go next year.|adeloastro_|False|https://redd.it/ehemcr|0|0.4|0|16|1|travel
ehelz9|2019-12-30 00:59:41|Intentionally Missing an International Connecting Flight|"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I'll be flying to Barcelona through Lisbon and am considering missing my flight to Barcelona to stay in Lisbon for a few days.

My itinerary is two separate tickets from separate airlines. New York to Barcelona, with a layover in Lisbon and from Barcelona to New York directly. I'm fairly sure I'd be ok getting off in Lisbon with no risk of my return flight to New York being cancelled but I'm slightly worried about dealing with customs in Lisbon. 

I would be purchasing another ticket from Lisbon to Barcelona if you folks don't find any problems with my thinking haha

&#x200B;

Could someone help me out and tell me if I can do this?"|Try_anal|False|https://redd.it/ehelz9|1|0.67|0|13|1|travel
eheiet|2019-12-30 00:51:44|American Airlines Flight Delayed by 24 hours, what compensation can I get?|"Bear with me; I've never experienced a flight delay this significant before. 

I booked flights from London Heathrow to Auckland New Zealand; with a stopover in Los Angeles LAX. My flights were booked so that I arrived on Christmas Eve and cost me a lot of money (£1800 return) due to my scheduled arrival before Christmas Day. 

However, during the stopover at LAX, our flight got delayed around 8 times before they *finally* ""cancelled"" it and rescheduled it for the following evening. American Airlines posted the passengers in hotels for the evening and provided everyone with $12 ""meal vouchers"". 

The cause of the cancellation with plane maintenance. I was told by American Airlines customer services at LAX that I'd be entitled to ""compensation"". 

I've reached out to American Airlines and they've offered to ""either send you a voucher for $175, or if you have an AAdvantage account we can issue you 10,000 bonus miles"". To me; this sounds like a very pitiful compensation amount. Is this normal? 

I do have Travel Insurance but my understanding is that I should go through the airline first. Furthermore, I'm unsure if it's too late to raise a claim with them now. 

**Does anyone have experience with claiming better compensation through the airline or advice on going through my insurer?** 

Thank you."|WantFurtherEdu|False|https://redd.it/eheiet|2|0.55|0|10|1|travel
ehgw5o|2019-12-30 04:11:47|Need some help choosing a cheap tropical destination|"So basically I fly standby and flights are next to nothing for me. I wanna take a solo trip for nye somewhere with a beach and warm weather. In central or South America would be great but I am on such a small budget so really need a place that is close to the airport and with hostels around $12! I just want a really laid-back spot, nothing crazy.

 I've thought about Costa Rico(kinda far from airport), Mexico (leaning toward Playa Del Carmen), Hawaii (too expensive accommodation), Panama City (Weather doesn't look too good), and some others. 

Thought I'd reach out and see if anyone had some suggestions or cheap backpacker spots. Also considering anywhere warm and cheap in Europe. I'm kinda all over the place. Any ideas!?"|mendenhallmustangs|False|https://redd.it/ehgw5o|0|0.25|0|6|1|travel

eh8pui|2019-12-29 17:36:14|Morocco - Soccer & Itinerary help|" I’m headed to Morocco in two weeks and I’m trying to finalize my loose itinerary. I saw the Marrakech soccer team has a game next Saturday. I’m a big soccer fan and it seems like a great opportunity to break up the day of walking around.  Has anyone attended a game before or has an idea of how to attend?

If anyone has any critiques on the below, I would LOVE to see it. This is mostly based on advice I’ve seen on other posts. I’m a female traveling solo so I’m trying to make everything a little more rigid and planned than how I normally travel. 

Day 1- Day 6 Taghazout (already booked)

Day 7- Day 8 Marrakech - General walking around & hopefully soccer

Day 9- Day 10/11 Excursion for hiking in Imlil and Camel/camping near Ait Ben Haddou.  I don’t need to go all the way out to the Sahara & I read the recommendation of booking excursions through the riad/hotel once I arrive. 

I believe these all return to Marrakech.

eh9obx|2019-12-29 18:48:32|X-Post JapanTravel. Itinerary check June 1-16 (Tokyo, Osaka, Nachi, Kyoto).|"Hello all!

My wife and I are planning a first trip to Japan in June 2020 and would like some input on my itinerary, whether it’s do-able. I also have a few questions. Thank you in advance.

​

Trip details

Duration: two weeks

Number of people: two (2)

Cities we plan on visiting: Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nachikatsuura?

Main interests: Hiking, Nature, Temples, food, parks/gardens. We both don’t have a problem with walking a lot. I would like to go to a little less visited place to get away from the bustle of the city. We don't want to try and fit too much into one day and want to make sure that what we're planning is feasible. Also any other recommendations would be greatly appreciated as well. We also have no plans set in stone hence the post.

​

Day 1 Tokyo

Land in NRT scheduled for 3:15 June 2nd.

Exchange money, pick up pocket wifi, get Suica card

Check in

Get some food, walk around some where and get our bearings. Any recommended places to take it easy.

June 3rd-June 6th Osaka - We want to spend roughly three days here. Spending a day checking out Osaka, day trip to Hyogo & Kobe?, day trip Nara.

June 6th-June 7th Nachikatsuura - I really want to see Nachi falls. I don't really know the best place to stay or if this is enough time to do such. Google maps says its about a 5hr train ride, so if we leave June 6th morning get there in the afternoon we have should have time to see the falls, and explore the next day while leaving a little later to Kyoto (6hr train ride).

June 7th - June 11 Kyoto. Leave in the afternoon to get to Kyoto (Long train ride). I know there are a lot of things to see. We definitely want to do the touristy stuff like Kinkau-Ji, Arashiyama, and the likes. But anything off the beaten path that would be cool to see like hikes.

June 11 - 16 Tokyo. I'm open to switching some days out here in exchange for some more time in another city or some place different. With a roughly two hour train ride from Kyoto in the afternoon that would give us 5.5 days in Tokyo not including the first day. Flight leave at 5:30 PM from NRT.

Questions

The places we are travelling I don't know if it makes sense to get a JR Pass? It would be nice to have that expense out of the way if it is close though.

Does it make sense to book the Shinkansen tickets when I land in advance of the days I will be travelling?

Given our planned itinerary, how much money for transit per day via Suica should we budget?

Like I posted above we don't have any plans set in stone. Nothing booked other than the flights. We really do like getting away from the beaten path to hike, or try something new. I hope that what provided is enough information to get some feedback. If there is anything else I can provide please let me know.

​

Thanks for your feedback/input."|hermieburger|False|https://redd.it/eh9obx|2|1.0|0|3|1|travel
