eh55jv|2019-12-29 11:54:29|An argument for the existence of God.|"Hi folks. Lifelong atheist and sceptic here to present an argument that does indeed point to a God, if God is defined as such:


A) An entity (being/power/force or whatever) that stands apart from its own creation, i.e. is not bound by space and time.
B) The thing that creates/sustains the whole of existence.
C) All-knowing. 

Hopefully we can agree that this is a good starting point so let’s work with this definition.

And please hear me out and remain open-minded once you realize where I’m going with this, as I’m afraid you’ll just shut down and make an assumption that I’m wrong right off the bat. Anyhow, here goes.

For the sake of simplicity let’s start with B). That which creates and sustains the whole of existence.
Now, what is existence? We need to look really carefully into this before proceeding. We assume existence is made up of the universe around us and everything it cointains: matter, energy, fields and so on. I say we ASSUME this, because even though it might seem to be the most straight-forward of claims, we have made an assumption that is not in line with our actual experience: as far as we know, the world does not have an independent existence outside of our experience. We assume it does, we have an intuition that it does, but if we’re gonna go about this the most strict way possible, the world as we know it has always appeared to us only in conjunction with the medium of our experience. Never outside of it. Experience seems to be the more fundamental component, because we know for a fact that the world can and does appears in it; we cannot, however, prove the opposite to be the case without referring back to our experience beforehand. Therefore, in being rigorous and making as few assumptions as possible, we can conclude that existence, as far as we can tell, is a thing that appears in our experience. So what brings this existence into being, what perpetuates it? Simply awareness. The very thing that gives shine to the world, that illuminates it, in all its colourful beauty, that lets it rise and be known, intimately and spontaneusly and real as can be.

That would account for B). Notice that whatever objection one tries to raise, one gets stuck making a tacit assumption that the world has its own independent existence outside of experience. I concede that it might be a reasonable assumption to make to some degree, but since we know for a fact that the world as we know it only ever appears in conjunction with awareness, the burden of proof is on the one making the assumption to show that the world can and does appear without it and independent of it. Until that burden of proof is met, let’s keep to the facts - and so I’ll be claiming that B) for now.

On to A). Something not bound by space and time.
Let’s start by deep diving into the concept of time. What is it, really? Simply put, it’s the progression of events from the past, through the present and to the future. But when you think about it, have you, or anyone else for that matter, actually ever experienced the past and/or the future? Only through thought. Thoughts can give rise to an apparent past or future, but the thoughts themselves only appear in the now. They can retrospectively appear in the past, but that’s only through the aid of another thought. As far as your experience goes, it is always and has always been only now, with the past and future being ”filled in” in the form of memories and dreams and aspirations through the medium of thoughts that occur in the ever-present now. So if time springs from thoughts interacting with the now, then the passage of time is actually not fundamental. But what could possibly stand outside of time? Well, let’s think of it this way.

From the point of view of pure awareness, pure awareness being the background against which everything we know of manifests, the very thinker conjuring up yesterday or the day of tomorrow, is just another phenomenon occuring within awareness. Awareness, then, can only know the now, since that which gives rise to an apparent past and future will necessarily only ever manifest in the now.
Let me make clear again that yes, time appears to flow but that’s only from the limited point of view of the self – the one noticing patterns, the one feeling duration, the one making judgments, the one reacting to what happens and so on. Key to understanding the the higher perspective is to realize that this very self is ITSELF another thing, another occurence that is only known against the backdrop of awareness. If this were not the case, you’d never imagine being a self in the first case - in other words, the feeling of self has a certain ”fingerprint” in awareness, a certain feel to it that makes it recognizable as such, and anything that has any type of subjective quality must necessarily manifest in awareness. And from the perspective of pure awareness, the patterns, the duration, the judgements, the reactions are mere phenomena that are only present in the tiny sliver of now in which they occur. They cannot ever appear anywhere else than now but through the aid of thoughts – thoughts that appear now.
And since time appears in awareness, and awareness is automatically separate from whatever appears in it (much like the TV screen has its own independent existence outside of the action taking place on its surface), we can conclude that awareness stands apart from time.

That’s half of A). The second part has to do with space, so let’s take a look at this phenomenon a little more in depth. This is gonna get thorny, so buckle up.

Have you ever noticed, that wherever you go it is always ”here”? You cannot ever rid yourself of here. If you go over there, there becomes the new here. So here cannot be defined by the objects that appear in it, as the objects continually change but the here-ness remains untouched.
So the correct way to look at the concept of here is that it is something that takes place when perceptions interact with awareness. Creating a representation of the world out of perceptions is what the mind does, all day, every day. The perceptions themselves are not essential to what we call here, but more often than not here manifests in the form of three-dimensional space. So space is a manifestation of here, which comes into being when perceptions meet awareness.

Awareness is more fundamental than the space, as when perceptions go away the world ”disappears”, but the awareness itself remains. Space being something that appears in awareness, let’s us conclude, by the same logic as above, that awareness itself stands apart from space, is not bound by it.

If you’re skeptical about this last claim, remember that the mind conjures up a world on its own every night you go to sleep and have a dream. A full 3D world, sometimes real as real life, made up entirely of mind and not of matter. Upon waking, we assume the world around us is real in its own right, but this is merely an assumption, as the world itself, as far as we can tell, has only ever appeared to us through the light of awareness. The world being able to exist without it has not met its burden of proof, so in stickning with the known facts we can conclude that space as we know it occurs in awareness, and awareness is therefore prior to it and independent of it.

That’ll do for A). Onward.  

C) Awareness is, deep down, knowing. You cannot be aware of a sound for instance, and not know exactly what it sounds like; when it appears in awareness, it is at once known. If you look out at a field of grass, you know it is green; look at the glimmer of light through tinted glass, and you could fill volumes trying to relate the wealth of information laid bare before your eyes.
So it is quite obvious to say that pure awareness (not the located ”you” behind your eyes, but that in which even that phenomenon manifests) knows all your feelings, desires, etc. It is in its very nature to do so! Not only that, but it knows every hope, thought, feeling, desire and fear of every sentient creature capable of such experiences; at all times, without a hitch, ever. If something can be known, it will necessarly appear against this background, so to say the background is all-knowing is almost tautologic in  a sense - *of course knowlegde is known!*

So, we’ve defined God, and I’ve tried to check all boxes. You might feel cheated in a way, cause this isn’t the God you were expecting, but it fits the definition so make of it what you will. Nothing changes – there’s no dogma, no tenets, nothing to pray to, nothing to obey – except maybe one’s perspective on things.
I’ll be very intersted to hear what you guys have to say on this and am looking forward to a pleasant exchange. I’ll say this though, to spare you from having to ask ”How do you know any of this? Can you prove it?”.
All that I have laid out is available for each and every one through direct experience. While consciousness itself seems to be a really, really tough nut to crack from a scientific standpoint, subjectively we can study it and know tons about its nature since we’re made out of it! The most enigmatic phenomenon known to science is sitting right at the core of our being, ready to be untangled by means of its own capabilities, yet most people haven’t even considered undertaking the most fascinating exploration of studying subject with subject.

ebae6e|2019-12-16 04:50:27|The ethics of eating meat|"EDIT: Wow, I didn't realize the hornet's nest I was kicking over here, this is a very interesting discussion with lots of great input! Thanks to most everyone for being logical and respectful. 

I realize this is probably an uncommon topic for a thread in here, but I feel like this is a philosophical and ethical question we should probably consider. This, of course, assumes that any standard of objective morality exists at all. 

I've been a meat eater all my life and I do so love it. It's tasty and healthy for us (provided it's the right kind and in moderation) and was once essential to human evolution. But recently, I started dating a vegetarian girl. She's 22 and hasn't eaten meat in 10 years. She isn't arrogant or self-righteous about it, and recognizes that it isnt the peak of ethics and morality. She hasn't tried to shame me about eating meat or tried to convince me otherwise. We've only discussed it whenever I've brought it up. As a result of those few discussions and watching her dietary habits, it's caused me to think about my previously held assumptions and point of view regarding meat eating. 

The debate in my head goes like this:

One common argument in favor of meat eating is that it's part of the natural order and many other species do it to smaller and weaker and/or less intelligent species. Taken to its logical extreme though, that could justify any negative or destructive natural impulse we have. Of course, feeding ourselves and wanting to rape or murder another human are very different things with different implications and results, but they are still ""natural"" impulses, deeply buried in the most ancient part of our psyche. ""Natural"" impulses can be morally bad as well as as good. 

Kant once said that if we want to consider something a universal law, we should be willing to apply it to all things at all times. So, taking the might-makes-right argument to its extreme, you could argue that there would be nothing morally wrong with a species far more intelligent/powerful than us raising us for the purpose of slaughter and consumption, or hunting us for consumption. 

Also, the vegetarians argue, just as we expect humans to ignore their immoral natural desires left over from our ape and caveman days because we recognize that causing unnecessary suffering to sentient beings is wrong, why do we not hold the same standard to ourselves when it comes to subjugating and using other sentient and semi-intelligent creatures to use as food? They argue that while man is an animal, he is a much higher order animal with greater capacity for moral reasoning and empathy, and that this carries the responsibility of acting more ethically, especially towards lower order animals. They argue that if might does not make right among humans, nor should it between humans and animals. 

Meat eaters often argue that while meat may not be *technically* necessary to survive, its necessary for humans to thrive because of its caloric and nutritional density, among other things. The vegans and vegetarians argue against this. The data conflicts a lot and I'm not a nutritionist, so I can't say who's right; it also depends on the individual. But the vegans argue that since we have enough alternative protein choices other than meat in the western world, and that meat is no longer necessary for either surviving or thriving, it's not ethical to eat it anymore. 

On the other hand, I think there are great cases to be made for, say, ethical hunting, versus the slaughterhouse industry as it stands in its current state. It makes for good herd management and can even protect the environment, especially in places where things like deer and hogs have no natural predators anymore. And God knows most of the animals that are hunted die much more quickly and cleanly, and live a much more natural life before death, compared to the average cow or pig.

What do you all think about this issue? Have you given it much thought before? I certainly don't want to give up eating meat, but I feel personally compelled to confront this issue as honestly and objectively as I'm able."|SpartanB203|False|https://redd.it/ebae6e|3717|0.85|0|2411|1|philosophy

**1.** **One ought not harm or impose risk of harm upon another.** 

**2.** **Exceptions to premise one: if the harm or risk imposed is to prevent greater harm or if consent has been secured.** 

**3.** **Bringing new sentient life into existence is both a harmful act in itself and a risk of even greater harm.**

**4.** **Bringing new sentient life into existence does not meet criteria for exception.** 

**5.** **Therefore, one ought not bring new sentient life into existence.**

**Possible objections:** 

· **But wait, we harm and risk harm all the time! Driving, consuming, competing, etc.**

**Answer: These meet the exception criteria for harm in order to prevent greater harm. These are** ***essential harms*** **intrinsic to life on earth. Furthermore, many of these harms fall under the category of consent. There are risks to all kinds of activities in life but consent is implied by those choosing to participate.** 

· **But wait, don’t the good things in life justify the harms?**

**Answer: No, not when you properly frame procreation as an interaction between moral agents. Causing harm or imposing risk of harm cannot be justified by providing something good \[or alluding to some possible good consequence\]. For example, imagine a wealthy philanthropist who keeps a slave to perform hard labor on his estate. The philanthropist’s good deeds do not justify the harms of keeping a slave. Furthermore, if the philanthropist were to free the slave after a period of time and give the former slave millions of dollars following their emancipation, it still wouldn’t justify the harms of keeping the slave in the first place. The proper relationship between the goods in life and the harms is the ability for the goods to serve as consolation, never justification.** 

· **But wait, can’t anyone just make a case for causing harm to prevent further harm? I mean, we can imagine all kinds of different scenarios in which causing harm might eventually prevent further harm.** 

**Answer: It’s true that there are lots of different scenarios we can imagine might prevent further harm in the future but the variables are too complex to truly predict. That’s why there needs to be robust evidence of imminent harm or imminent risk. What constitutes “robust” evidence? Robust evidence is evidence taken into account by a person who has done their due diligence to account for the most reasonable available evidence and acts in good faith. This could be observing an imminent disaster about to occur in real time \[such as a bus about to collide with a pedestrian\] or it could be something like preventing a potential illness with a vaccine. Either way, there needs to be a wealth of evidence to point to the fact that more harm will occur if an action is not undertaken and that there is a direct causative relationship between acts and consequences.**"|VeganAntinatalist|False|https://redd.it/ea83d7|6|0.6|0|61|1|philosophy

e686ds|2019-12-04 23:39:44|Metaphysics, Psychological motivations and Fallacious reasoning|"**Reasons and Motives**

Something that comes up frequently in discussions about ontologies that assign weight to consciousness and ontologies that assign weight to matter is the topic of the mechanisms of belief. What is often brought up are questions of emotional motivation, valuing rationality and science.

Physicalists and external realists or whatever one might  want to call this position seemengly want to take the rational high ground and argue and speak from the values of rationality, science and self honesty. On the basis of these values those holding an opposing view are often accused of coming to their position  for emotionally driven reasons. In this post I want to adress this phenomenon.

I want to start off by saying that I completely share these  values. However in my experience it is often but not always assumed that people holding nonphysicalist and non emergentist views lack or in some way don't apply these values. I think that's an assumption worth questioning. Someone might even be tempted to utter something like this. 'Instead of holding irrational spiritual beliefs we should be reasonable and surrender such beliefs ' Besides the point that non emergentist views don't necessarily entail spirit I think the appropriate response to such an utterance despite possibly being well intentioned goes as follows. This is question begging in that non emergentist views being unreasonable is precisely the point in contention, so one shouldn't take that as a given. One could obviously just say the same thing in reverse. Both sides obviously thinks they're holding the more reasonable position.

**Meta-discussion**

Perhaps most importantly however I would want to separate  a discussion about motivating factors from the ontological discussion. Unless this separation is made the conversation can quickly diverge into a meta-conversation, meaning having a conversation about the conversation, as opposed to actually having the ontological  discussion. These meta-points can easily become fallacious in that motivations are adressed instead of the arguments which is technically called an ad hominem fallacy which I'm sure many people reading this would know. It can also be a red herring in that it diverges from what's relevant.

Some of the claims regarding psychological and emotional motivations go as follows.

Non physicalists and non emergentists are driven by emotionally comforting factors regarding meaning and purpose, wanting to believe in something special like God, spirit or something like that, or/and wanting there to be something special about conciousness. In other words the idea is that the position is arrived at because it provides something phychological for the person and it also may or may not involve the idea that the person is unwilling to face the undeniable truth or facts.

This metadiscussion about psychologically motivating factors is certainly a legitimate one to have, however I think there tends to be an overemphasis on this for the physicalists and emergentists whereby it tends to be the inappropriate direction to take the discussion. I prefer the focus of the conversation to primarily be about the reasons for the disagreement. However in my experience the conversation tends to often diverge from this focus.  I would say that this is a hinderance for valuable productive dialogue and I contend that we should instead aim our focus at the immediate topic at hand, i.e. the metaphysical discussion.

To this, someone may object by stating that ' if the context in which the initial argument was presented is not a debate then adressing psychological motivations isn't technically fallacious if it isn't intended as an argument.'

I would argue that there still is a remaining problem. That is that adressing an argument by adressing psychological motivations or engaging in other meta-points regardless of the context in which it's presented and regardless of the intentions behind it is fallacious in that it entails a red herring or/and an ad hominem fallacy, and more so distracts from the immediate topic at hand, namely the metaphysical discussion.

**Psychological motivations for External realism**

It's difficult for anyone to be self reflectively cognisant  of what is really driving one's thinking. Many views seemingly are post hoc rationalisations arrived at by psychologically motivating reasons. I believe it's very rare if not entirely nonexistent for people to escape this predicament of having views independently of psychologically motivating reasons. Although this isn't to say that it applies to every belief one might have. This predicament includes myself. Admittedly I find Monistic idealism or what I also like to call a conciousness-only ontology to be a fun idea. So do I find other views that I don't hold however, but I aknowledge the possibility that I've arrived at this position by psychologically motivating factors, which again, almost nobody escapes.

In an attempt to give some perspective I'll commit the very sin just described by describing what I percieve as psychologically motivating factors for an external realist and emergentist view. How the situation seems to me is as follows.

Abandoning literal religious ideas and coming to a more materialist atheistic perpsective often involves a kind of philosophical trauma regarding buying into mythical claims. One may feel betrayed or even fooled for buying into childish mythical thinking. This develops a shadow in regards to seemingly religious mythical thinking, and expresses itself by resisting  anything seemingly unscientific, and resisting ideas seemingly similar to new age ideas. A popular belief is that physicalist and emergentist views destroys all meaning and purpose in life. Therefore by rejecting non emergentist and physicalist views someone may fancy themselves being realistic, courageous and being willing to accept or recognise the inconvenient truth or the facts. Hence a psychologically motivating factor for an external realist and emergentist view probably is related to this phenomenon.

Similarly to religion, ones view of the nature of reality  becomes very tied to one's identity and so physicalist and emergentist views as with any other metaphysics are most likely psychologically difficult to let go of because of the challenging nature of letting go of one's identity. This is very difficult for the ego to do as it has to be willing to die to an extent. This is very similar to letting go of religious ideas.

Another important motivating factor for a physicalist and  emergentist ontology as I see it is the scary nature of challenging one's sense of reality. This is mostly with respect to conciousness only-ontologies. I think when it's a deeply ingrained belief that reality is external and physical that becomes not only challenging but scary to seriously question. As such I would say that a key motivating factor for external realism and emergentism is fear.

More so, I find it rather naive to believe that external realism and emergentism is the mainstream view because it's arrived at by objective, careful reasoning or scientific investigation.

It's not like philosophers and scientists were one day thinking,""hmmm, I wonder if there is a mind independent reality in which a brain exists, which generates consciousness, or if the only thing which exists is consciousness? Okay, let's get to work, run the experiments to find out what's true.""

**A consciousness-only ontology, literal religious ideas and new age ideas**

Another thing I'd like to address is the comparison of a  consciousness-only ontology to literal religious ideas and to some extent new age ideas of spirit or something like that.

A religious person still believes in a physical world as outside and independent of conciousness, God as separate from the physical world, as a spirit or a soul distinct from physicality, and heaven as almost some kind of physical location. This view is not in any sense monistic and so is entirely different from a conciousness-only ontology.  Rather it completely denies all of the above. So to confuse or liken a conciousness-only ontology to literal religious ideas and even to some new age ideas completely misses this point.

**Conclusion**

As for my concluding thoughts, emergentist and physicalist views are also driven by psychologically motivating factors, and we should open ourselves up to seriously entertain even scary views. Which is to say that we should be intellectually fearless. Conciousness-only ontologies should be distinguished from religious ideas and I think we should primarily stick to discussing the reasons to believe one or another ontology. A meta-discussion of any kind is secondary and I would argue that it should be viewed as a separate conversation."|Highvalance15|False|https://redd.it/e686ds|14|0.9|0|27|1|philosophy

e1t048|2019-11-26 04:54:02|Materialism/Physicalism vs Dualism - Looking for feedback|"Working on a paper for Philosophy class where I defend the position of Materialism against Dualism. 


I was wondering if I could get some feedback on the arguments I made, as well as some objections to my arguments, etc. 



**Thesis** 


In this paper I will defend the materialist position, which is the idea that everything supervenes on the physical. Materialism holds that the universe conforms to the condition of being physical, and that even things that at first glace don't appear to be “physical” such as social nature, psychology, and emotions, are ultimately either physical or are a supervention on the physical.  In this paper I will defend the materialist position, which is the idea that everything supervenes on the physical. In order to defend the Materialist position, I will cite Paul Churchland’s “Neural Dependence” argument, as well as William of Ockham’s, “Ockham’s Razor” principle.  





**Exposition**

Dualism is the idea that the mind and body are two different
“substances”, in which the brain is made of physical matter, while the mind
is a non-material substance that is seperate.



Descartes gives the following argument: 


* P1: I can pretend that my body doesn't exist

* P2: I cannot pretend that I don't exist.  


* Conclusion: It follows that I am in essence a thinking substance, and that my mind needs no physical place or matter. Therefore, my mind/conscious is not identical to my body. 



Descartes could cast doubt upon his body, but not his mind. The fact that he could doubt one, but not the other, led him to believe that he must be made of two different kinds of substances. Descartes divides the universe into two parts: the physical (res extensa) and the conscious (res cogitans). 




Materialism is the idea that the “mind” (consciousness) is created by the body, and that our life experiences are caused by chemicals in the brain (or even are). Thus, if you were to take drugs which interfere with chemicals in your brain/body (such as antidepressants), it would have an affect on your “mind”. According to materialism, everything in the universe is either physical, or is a supervention on the physical.




**Criticisms/Evaluation**


In order to argue against Dualism in favor of Materialism, I will cite Churchlands argument from “Neural dependence”, as well as William of Ockham’s principle. 



Churchlands argument from the “Neural dependence” states that if the “mind” (consciousness, emotion, reasoning, etc) is truly distinct from the physical brain, and is only dependent on the physical brain for sensory input and volitional outputs, then it would be reasonable to expect that “mental” functions such as  consciousness, emotion, reasoning, etc would not be susceptible to things such as brain damage, pathology manipulation, and direct control. 




In Meditation 6, Descartes is “forced” (as professor R Johns put it) to acknowledge that the mind and the brain do apparently “intermingle”. Even in the “ad hoc” explanations the author was forced to conclude that there is a relation between the mind and the brain, and that one possible scenario could be that the mind “outsource” certain tasks to the brain. Thus, we can clearly conclude that both the mind and the brain are not distinct and independent from one another, as true independence implies not being affected or influenced by another, whole in the most common case of getting drunk, we can clearly see that this isn't the case.  



‘Ockham's Razor” is the principle that we should not propose more causes for something than the minimum amount of propositions that are needed. 




In other words, the simpler the explanation, the more likely it is to be true. Although Ockham’s principle itself is not a specific argument that is purpose built against Dualism, it does have some appeal. It is undoubtedly that physical matter exists, however Dualism on the other hand is unable to explain the relationship between the mind and body, and often has to resort to “superfluous ontological apparatus”. Materialists are able to elaborate on their explanations, however oftentimes Dualists do not provide the same level of explanations. 



**Objections**



I expect substance dualists to respond to my arguments by suggesting that the brain and mind relationship is like a crutch enabling a person to walk: if you take away the crutch or damage it, it affects the person's ability to walk. In the same way, the mind outsources certain functions to the brain. Thus, if the brain is damaged, it will have an effect on the mind. 



Another response I expect from dualists is that if everything indeed was physical, then how do we account for consciousness, meaning/purpose, love, and altruism. 



In regards to the argument using Ockham's Razor, I expect dualists to accuse Materalists of shifting the burden of proof, rather than outright refute the completing theory.

Lately, the answer has been ""relatively little"". They can play jeopardy, drive cars, and diagnose patients, but also can make remarkable contributions to fields thought to be more ""human endeavors"", such as [paintings](https://www.nextrembrandt.com/) or [music](http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/Emily-howell.htm). They have also ventured in to the world of literature, although with less spectacular results, as seen in [""Harry Potter and What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash""](https://botnik.org/content/harry-potter.html) and [Sunspring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7x2Ihqjmc), a sci-fi screenplay.

I was curious what would be the result of training a [neural network](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn) on the works of different philosophers. I ran it on one work (which is admittedly a small sample size) for each philosopher, and asked it to generate some text based on it.

I ran it on:

* Thus Spoke Zarathustra
* A Critique of Pure Reason
* Republic
* The Tao te Ching
* The Second Sex

and perhaps will run it on more in the future.

You can see the results [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Bx2F4b4PjX25vZna7eGJonwbCD89QpVd).

dvkaow|2019-11-13 01:35:55|A Philosophical Standpoint on Philosophy: The Binary System|"Hi everyone! 

NOTE: this is my first post here but I think I meet the guidelines to warrant my own post and not the discussion thread. I'm an amateur philosopher at best, I'm second year in university and still learning a lot, but I think I've thought about philosophical topics for a long time but could never put it to words till I discovered the subject. This is currently my theory that is a little meta-philosophical, but it's more of a discussion as to why it is so important to study philosophy as a human being (imo ofc) and what it does for a person. I also wanted to see if this has already been discussed before and I'm just a moron lol. With that out of the way, let's begin.

&#x200B;

I've spent a decent bit of time understanding the mind-body problem, and generally the issues surrounding how we view the mind and view the world in general. Philosophers that are currently on my mind are Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Nietzche, Hobbes, Humes etc. Generally speaking, when philosophers tackle lifes problems, they are trying to add a purpose or lack there of. Descartes spouted that the meaning of life is God itself, and only God allows for clear and distinct understanding of the world, Hobbes stated that the only way for a functioning political system to work is based on social contract theory in order for a sovereign just ruler who acts FOR the people. But I would say I'm like 60% nihilist, because in a general sense I believe that whatever these philosophers state, is never the truth. The only truth in life is we cannot bottle down life to one truth, and because of that any actions we say or do are inconsequential to the world as a whole. Hence, we live in a zero sum world where everything stabilizes itself to nothing, and doesn't really follow a purpose but does follow a pattern.  Understanding the difference between the two ways of thinking, I propose a model of understanding philosophical enlightenment, in a way that sounds less obnoxious than the Allegory of the Cage. 

I think basic understanding of philosophy, just understanding why we question things and what it means to follow different ideologies in life and how they can be defined, is already a person stepping out of the shell. The reason I stated I was 60% nihilistic was because if the world was devoid of purpose, then there truly is no reason why not to just off yourself for the heck of it. The understanding that there is a devoid of purpose is what brings about the binary system: that there is a counter for how people have meanings to their lives, they are either at 0 or at 1.  Pure nihilism would be at 0, whilst following a specific desire or meaning in life would be 1. I think most people spend their life searching for their specific 1 meaning, but with the understanding of the subject of philosophy, you go from 0.8 on the scale, to 0.2 (with further philosophical research, I would say the world average would always be 0.5.)  Philosophers in general discover that the 1 they believe in is not true in the fullest sense, and reach 0 and then try to work their way up to what they think is a reasonable and logical 1 meaning or way of living life.

I think philosophical enlightment is reached when you then realize, that there is no singular one (we can conclude this through nihilistic thought processes, I can go into that if that is asked)  and that you can move on the scale *any* time you want. With the knowledge that you can move on the scale at any time, and that if nothing is true, anything you want to be true *can* be with enough vigor and effort (in reasonable terms) then you are freed of worldly ambition and are free to pursue your own philosophy in life, which you can either chose to stabilize yourself on the scale with, or that philosophy is itself the free pursuit of any philosophy in life, which is currently what I believe in (but its funny maybe If I stop believing in it, wouldn't that just make the theory more right?)

Now, objections and other arguments. Me and my friend got baked and decided to delve into the theory, and the idea of religion then came up (I assume its okay to talk about it in a philosophical context because we as philosophers can view stuff purely objectively, right?). Religion after all, is what is what people consider to be a very popular meaning in life, and although religion and philosophy may not be completely separate *or* combined, belief in religion most often then not restricts people from exploring *more* philosophical views that may differ. In that sense, a person who believes in religion may be idle on the scale and have not moved since birth.  However, we then argued that if we assumed that the person is not indoctrinated to only believe that one religion is the 'correct' answer to life, they should lie on 0.5 of the scale as well, as a normal person would. This is because they still have the ability and coherence to choose between somewhat different 1s (different singular meanings of lives), and hence, unknowingly and slightly more free than they realize even without philosophical input. 

And that's it. It could probably be more fleshed out, but I honestly thought it was a very interesting and collected way of looking at philosophical enlightenment, and imo all philosophers including me are elitist because we allegedly understand more of life's more complex phenomenon. Let me know any counter-arguments you can think of I and will try and give you a good discussion with it, but since i subscribe to the ideal that no true answer exists, I might just think your idea is better but still agree with mine (not to say I can't change my mind obviously, but if it's a model argument I cant think of any reason why not to still believe in my model unless its got a gaping flaw I can't answer)

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Binary scale to model theoretical philosophical enlightenment, and the simple act of understanding of the scale is what allows for philosophical freedom, or freedom to any extent if the person is capable of it."|RedFrickingX|False|https://redd.it/dvkaow|5|1.0|0|10|1|philosophy

for posts/comments which are related to philosophy but wouldn't
necessarily meet our posting rules (especially
[PR2](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/rules#wiki_all_posts_must_develop_and_defend_a_substantive_philosophical_thesis.)).
For example, these threads are great places for:

* Arguments that aren't substantive enough to meet PR2.

* Open discussion about philosophy, e.g. who your favourite philosopher
  is, what you are currently reading

* Philosophical questions. Please note that /r/askphilosophy is a great
  resource for questions and if you are looking for moderated answers we
  suggest you ask there.

This thread is **not** a completely open discussion! Any posts not
relating to philosophy will be removed. Please keep comments related to
philosophy, and expect low-effort comments to be removed. All of our
normal [commenting
rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/rules#wiki_commenting_rules)
are still in place for these threads, although we will be more lenient
with regards to CR2.
