# Post Here - Subreddit Predictor: Recommendation API

## Overview

This repository is the primary source of truth for the recommendation API for Post Here, the subreddit predictor.
This project is being developed primarily as a Lambda School Build Week Project in January 2020.

The goal of the API is to return a list of recommended subreddits given the content of a user's prospective post.
The recommendations will ideally provide the user with the most appropriate subreddits for their post.

## Data
